I looked at several different makes of phone to see whether they would maybe be better than a Motorola. I purchased the Honor, but overall it was not what I was really looking for  -  nice looking phone, but somehow I just did not like it. So, after a lot of reading regarding reviews etc. I decided to go for another Motorola  -  the G34 5G. in the hopes that it would be more efficient and useful feature wise than my old e5 Play.Best move I made  -  this phone is packed with features I never new existed, is so logical and easy to navigate. The touch screen is super sensitive, responds immediately, and moving from one function to another is very fast. Nice bright screen, colours are very rich, and text is very clear. Sound is loud enough in my opinion, and does not have a ""tinny"" tone.  love the larger keypad on this  -  always had a problem with the much  smaller one on the old e5 Play, so only ever used it when I had to. It is now a pleasure to send texts, and all so simple and easy.Phone was very quick and simple to set up (once all the usual Google claptrap was out of the way) All very idiot proof. Imported all my data re emails, contacts etc. without having to do anything  -  all quite idiot proof really.Connected to my wifi at once. The only issue I had was trying to find out where the sim card tray was!! Could not see where there was a slot anywhere on the side of the phone that  was indicated on the instruction sheet. After almost giving up and putting  it back in the box, I realised there was a clear gel cover on the back which was hiding the location of the sim tray  (hello!!) Bit fiddly getting the nano card in, but once it was done, it was all just ready to go.I have had it for about two weeks now, and have monitored the battery life  -  it is very good. Leaving it switched on all day until late evening, with average useage, I have only had to recharge it 3 times as yet. I had to get a plug adapter (comes with a 2  pin plug on the usb lead. It does a rapid charge in approx 40 mins to fully charge from around 30%.Cameras work well - takes really clear pics with good colour. Video with sound works well too. Macro feature is very good, and useful that is has a qr scanner too. Had to download an app for that on the other phone. Easy to hold and not heavy or cumbersome.I never seemed to form a relationship with my old phone - always treated it as a necessary evil really and preferred my pay as you go Doro phone. However, with this phone I can honestly say I really love it and wish I had made the move a few yeas ago. I enjoy using this phone, it does not cause me any  hassle, responds quickly and efficiently to commands, and is just so great in every way. For what is considered as a budget phone, it does all I need it to and more, so why pay hundreds of pounds for a ""non budget"" phone. I consider this phone an absolute bargain at this  price for what you are getting.Cannot comment on face/fingerprint recognition because I have not got those features  set up. I did change the clock icon on the hoe screen because it was so big!! Downloaded K-9 email app (Mozilla thunderbird) and it configured and set up my email quickly, and works just great.  I do not like or use gmail.I would highly recommend this  to anyone wanting a  decent phone without the high price tag  -  ideal for a youngster\'s first phone even. Well done Moto.

The photo was taken on 15th October 2023, 2 months before moto g34 was available for sale in the UK, so I can only assume a worker at the factory accidentally snapped a photo during testing. Other than that I'm very happy with the phone. It does feel sluggish if a lot of apps are opened in the background and the screen doesn't show true black but I'm not using the phone to play games so it's enough for my needs.

I was even going to return it after it came. But after using it for a few hours, I was so blown away by how good this phone was, I\'m keeping it!First of all, the amount of stuff this phone comes with is CRAZY! I have an iPhone 15 Pro and the only thing that came with was a usb c cable! This comes with:- A case- A pre-installed screen protector- 67W Charging brick and cable- EarphonesI kept having to remind myself this was only £189! To come with so much stuff is insanely generous!The device itself is gorgeous. I got it in blue and I absolutely love the design; the two tone back is very smart, and despite being plastic, feels like glass. The cameras are quite large too and help add to its premium look.The phone itself is incredibly light; it\'s lighter than my smaller iPhone 15 Pro! This is mostly because of its plastic build, but it doesn\'t feel cheap at all.The display is gorgeous. It\'s a 6.7"" AMOLED panel surrounded by very thin bezels. The punch hole camera is unobtrusive, and the panel itself has very punchy colours and looks sharp - I think the resolution is only 1080p but it\'s very crisp.The speakers are decent, with sound coming out of the top and bottom. Imo it\'s one of the weakest areas of the phone, but despite that, they still sound good.Speaking of sound, the headphone jack is a welcome addition; the included earphones are ok for freebies. The design of them is nice, but if you turn off Dolby Atmos enhanced sound, they are tinny and lifeless. Keep Dolby Atmos enabled with these buds!My Poco has 512GB storage, so I don\'t feel the need to use a micro SD card, of which this phone supports up to 1TB I believe.This isnt my first time using Android, but it is my first time using MIUI. After a few days of use, I find it has less features and customisability than Samsung phones, but it\'s skin is reminiscent of iOS, which may make the transition for newbies easier. There was a lot of bloat preinstalled on this phone, but it was easily uninstalled. I did start to get adverts too, but after installing adblock, they\'ve gone and not come back.There were a lot of system updates to install as well, all the way to Poco\'s latest HyperOS. I\'m not sure what\'s different between this and MIUI, they\'re mostly the same.I haven\'t used the phone enough to comment on battery life, but I love that the phone came with a 67W charger that can charge this phone INSANELY fast!!!Performance of the Poco M6 Pro is very impressive. I\'m not the heaviest of users; I don\'t game or do any editing. But I do browse Reddit, listen to a lot of music and watch YouTube. While there are some hiccups, the performance of this phone is so good in day to day that you\'ll have to remind yourself that this is supposed to be a budget phone!The only area that lets this phone down is the cameras. Photos are not great in the best of light, and completely fall apart in low light. I haven\'t recorded any video on it, but it doesn\'t even do 4K. I guess if they put good cameras on this, it would be too good and thered be no point in buying their other phones lol.Despite that, I\'m happily surprised by the Poco M6 Pro. Being so cheap, I had low expectations for this phone, but Poco have exceeded my expectations in every single category. Using this phone is an absolute joy, one which I don\'t plan on giving up any time soon.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Waseem Ahmed', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Quality at a great price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2024', 'Review Body': ""Great handset, really good value.

I havent tested it for gaming though.Battery life has two sides. If the phone is idle, it spends very low energy. On the other hand, when the phone is loaded, it drains faster than some other phones I used.I thought I wouldnt like the MIUI but it was surprisingly refined and easy to use. I didnt see any ads around either. I can say the MIUI is almost as good as stock Android.It comes with a case but I didnt like it too much because it leaves half of the back uncovered, and it has a big lip so it makes it harder to hold the phone. I bought a third party case and it is much better, covers the whole back and snugs the cameras.The other thing I didnt like the phone is its flat shape.

My last phone for several years was the very expensive Samsung flagship, the Galaxy Note 9. Before that was the S7 edge. This principle of buying products to last has usually served me well. My Note 9 recently developed a bad case of random resets of increasing frequency and, it being about 5 years old, I figured it was time to look around for something newer.I wasn\'t necessarily looking for a budget phone, price was NOT the deciding factor in my purchase.Rather I was looking at available functionality... those aspects of a phone that I like and want to repeat in my next one, versus those aspects I\'m not so bothered about.To look first at those issues which are common to all phones... the display on this is 6.5 inches pOLED, 1080 x 2400 pixels, up to 120 Hz refresh rate and up to 1300 nits brightness. Has a top central punch hole for the front camera. It\'s bright and vibrant, premium quality and is bright enough to use outside with zero problems on a sunny day. A premium display... every bit as good as the display on my previous Galaxy Note 9.The amount of bexel is perfect. Any less bezel and it would run the risk of your fingers and thumb that are holding the phone triggering unwanted response.I really, really like NOT having a curved, Samsung \'edge\' type display. I always thought it was a useless gimmick and it\'s great to have a flat display again after 8 years.There is no mention of Gorilla Glass on this handset. Motorola/Lenovo support have stated publicly in a discussion forum that this phone has a toughened glass display which is equivalent to Gorilla Glass.  Make of that what you will.  This, by the way, is much the same situation for most, if not all, mid-range and budget handsets around this price range.This phone has IP54 dust and splash resistance.  Don\'t take it in the shower or drop it in a puddle, and be careful on the beach.The weight of this handset is wonderful too after the heavy Note 9. It\'s physically smaller, lighter, and thinner than the Note 9 despite having a slightly larger display with higher refresh rate.The speakers are clear and loud enough. They, surprisingly, give a decent stereo image... oddly enough better than I got on my Note 9. They don\'t have much bass, even less than the Note 9 had.  They are a bit tinny sounding to be honest, but they are perfectly ok for handsfree speech or just a stream of radio music for the background. For proper music listening or watching long video content you\'ll probably want to connect to a speaker dock or use headphones if you want more bass.Speed wise the G84 5G uses the Qualcomm SM6375 Snapdragon 695 5G (6 nm) SOC/CPU. Octa-core (2x2.2 GHz Kryo 660 Gold & 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 660 Silver) with Adreno 619 Graphics Processor. It\'s not a flagship SOC. It\'s an older, mid-range chipset, but having said that, it\'s no slouch either and is still being fitted in mid range handsets from a numbers of manufacturers being released as recently as just last month (such as the OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G).You might need to drop the resolution down a bit if you demand to play ultra high resolution graphics MMOs, but for the vast majority of users its absolutely quick enough for everything you\'re likely to throw its way, plus being a bit slower than CPUs in the latest £1,000+ handsets means it uses less battery.... and talking of which, the fixed 5000 MAH Lithium Polymer is good for up to two days\' fairly solid use.  It takes a \'turbo\' charge of up to 30W too, which is plenty enough to charge the phone very quickly.  It comes with a 30W mains fast charger with a UK 3-pin plug.Personally I disapprove of fast/turbo charging as it kills batteries. It\'s much better, if you have the time, to slow charge at a lower wattage.  It means the battery will last longer.  There is NO option in settings to select to slow charge so if you don\'t want to Turbo charge and cook your battery then you will need to use a lower powered mains charger - and your battery will probably last a year longer if you do that.There is no built in wireless charging.  As someone who has wirelessly charged my last two handsets for around 8 years this was a bit of a pain to be honest.  However I picked up one of those USB-C type QI charging receivers for a few £\'s and fitted it inside the silicone case I\'m using and it\'s perfect.I use an app called Wi-Fi File Explorer Pro (from the Amazon App Store) (but there are plenty of similar apps) to handle transfers of stuff between handset and pc and it\'s almost as quick as cable and it saves having to remove the QI receiver.I slow charge overnight using wireless charging using an old 0.85A Blackberry charger.  Takes a few hours but it doesn\'t get hot so it\'s kind on the battery.Motorola/Lenovo don\'t bloat up your handset with software junk.  It\'s quite a novelty after having had a couple of Samsung phones with extreme bloatware overload.  Motorola\'s skin is practically vanilla android, which is nice.  The couple of extra apps they do include you can even actually uninstall, not just disable.  Almost immediately on purchase I got the option to update to Android 14 which I have done.A word of warning about android 14.... if you have any OLD apps which you like and use all the time (whether it\'s an old pre-malware version of ES File Explorer or pre-malware version of Quickpic, or Timeriffic, CalendarPad, Alreader or whatever... install them, side-load them if you must, BEFORE updating to Android 14. Android 14 is much more aggressive about sideloading and the use of old apps than Android 13 is, and it will block you from doing so. You can use ADB from a PC to get around it, but it\'s a hassle.This handset has NFC which can be used, among other things, for making payments in stores instead of having to use a bank card. Many competing handsets in this price range, and higher, do not include an NFC chip.  Sure it\'s not much used in Asia but it IS heavily used in Europe, so the kindest way to describe Asia-based manufacturers who don\'t include NFC in the handsets they release in Europe is that they are not paying attention.This phone includes Bluetooth 5.1, A2DP, LE.  It recognised my AptX receiver and activated AptX just fine.Camera... probably the most criticised part of this handset... but still absolutely fine. The 50 megapixel description is rather misleading in my opinion. I spoke about this with Motorola support and the camera app uses ""ultrapixels"" like my old HTC One M8 did.  The camera on the One M8 was pretty meh to be honest but this has been considerably better.  When using the camera app you will usually get a photo result of 12.53 megapixels size - this is because the software uses 4 input pixels to one output pixel, to average and take the best result.  Only by going into \'pro\' mode in the camera app will you actually be able to manually select to use the full 50 megapixel resolution.  The Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) seems to do a decent job and is good to have.I found the camera rather slow in operation compared to the 12.1MP native resolution camera on my old Note 9 and the image quality is roughly comparable.  It\'s not better than the Note 9\'s camera but I wouldn\'t say it\'s especially worse either, just different.  It consistently produces a colder image than the Note 9, in a different size ratio and at a different focal length.  It\'s perfectly acceptable.Dark environments is always the challenge of camera sensors and I would say that this camera holds it\'s ground very firmly against the Note 9\'s camera.  I did a number of tests and have no complaints.There is the option to use the excellent, free, OpenCamera app from the Play Store too for a different \'take\' on a camera app (pun unintended).The launcher on this handset is pretty good imo, but I\'ve used Nova Launcher Prime for so long, I just transferred my settings for that from my old handset.  If you wish to just use the stock launcher I think you will be quite happy.One downside which has been picked up on by reviewers is that Motorola only guaranteed one Android version level update, to Android 14, which has now been released, but tech magazines have stated their expectation that this handset will get Android 15, plus any necessary security updates, for 3 years.I went for the midnight blue, 12GB Ram 256GB storage version.  This comes with a clear silicone case - the type that usually turns brown after a few months, but it\'s enough to last until you get a case you like better.  I bought a blue carbon-fibre style silicone case ( ASIN B0D14B4YY8 ) which is great and fits perfectly, and tempered glass screen protector (which doesn\'t fit very well - too narrow).Now two issues which some people find contentious...I had a 512GB microSD card in my Note 9 and transferred it across to this handset. I have access to Google\'s YouTube Music premium streaming service but at a compressed, lossy 256kbps it\'s still not as good in terms either of convenience nor terms of audio quality as having locally saved music.  Locally saved music at 320kbps MP3 or FLAC is something I use much more than any streaming service, so this handset having the ability to fit an MicroSD, SDHC and SDHX card is very important.  The specifications don\'t state the maximum size micro SDHX it will accept but it could theoretically be as high as 2TB.It\'s something that all manufacturers COULD do without there being any validity to claims about increasing thickness or reduction of waterproofing.  I believe that the reason so many manufacturers have dropped microSD storage is so they can charge you more money for handsets with more storage and sell streaming service monthly subscriptions.I\'m something of an amateur musician, I play synths and pipe organ. My musical taste is extensive and varied and I use my phone to listen to a lot of music, mostly on a pair of wired Sennheiser Momentum 1.0 on-ear headphones so a headphone jack is pretty darned important. The headphone output on this handset is 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio. It\'s superb.I have a couple of high quality wireless headsets... they\'re great for gaming and I use them all the time but they simply do not deliver the level of detail/quality that I am used to from my music, plus there\'s all the mucking about with charging them and electrostatic interference from nearby electrical devices.  Sure, I just happen to have a spare SoundBlaster G3 compact USB-C DAC and headphone amp knocking about which I could use to plug in some high end headphones if I wanted to. I even have a compact AptX capable bluetooth receiver which I could use to power wired heaphones instead, so......even though it wouldn\'t cost me so much as a single penny if I were forced to give up the heaphone jack, there\'s one thing that Apple, Samsung and Google et al who have stormed off boldly down this path of functionality removal don\'t care about.... every single alternative to the phone having an actual headphone jack involves the user having to make sacrifices, involves the user having to make compromises in order to ""gain"" something THEY are telling you that you have to want.I don\'t need someone telling me what I want. I am perfectly capable of seeing for myself that removal of basic functionality in order to force users to compromise is not an advantage.I like being able to just plug in a pair of high quality headphones. No mucking about with chargers, no adaptors, no hassle, no sacrifice. No compromise.One unusual feature this handset includes which I\'ve not had on a phone in many years is a built in FM receiver.  It uses the headphones\' cable as an antenna and is absolutely superb; crystal clear and with no hiss when using my Sennheiser Momentum.  It is possible to use it without headphones plugged in, although the reception quality will almost certainly take a hit. The included FM receiver app is simple and easy to use. Very easy to scan and save your favourite stations.The under-screen fingerprint sensor is blisteringly fast and reliable, even when I\'m using the tempered glass screen protector.So, to summarise, after coming from an expensive, top of the range, flagship Samsung Note device from a few years ago I have to say I\'m extremely pleased with this phone. Add a screen protector and a QI charging receiver inside a silicone case and it does everything I want, very well indeed and at a phenomenally good price.There are similiarly priced handsets from the likes of OnePlus, Xioami/Redmi, Nothing/CMF, TCL, Nokia and even Samsung but a lot of them are more expensive with less functionality, slower MediaTek SOCs, missing NFC, missing headphone jack/microSD storage, bloatier UI etc.If you\'re looking for a new handset, regardless of the price range you\'re considering, then it\'s worth thinking about what parts of a smartphone functionality you want / must have and choosing accordingly.I would have happily bought a flagship phone to get all the functionality I want, but this time around I was forced to buy something much cheaper because it is only at the budget end of the market that manufacturers are paying attention to what customers actually want from their phones.At the current sale price of £179 this is a complete and utter bargain and frankly, blows all the competition out of the water imo.I\'ve included a couple of pictures taken by the phone too so you can see how the camera is absolutely fine, a couple in very low light - the night time one with the clock radio was taken by the light of a 3W LED bedside lamp within a lamp shade, plus a couple taken in daylight (although it\'s summer time in Scotland so it really should be called grey light), also a picture of the USB-C QI wireless charging receiver I\'m using which works perfectly - taken by my Note 9, as was the picture with it inside the blue silicone case.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Madeleine Scott Cree', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'An all-round decent smartphone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""So my past five phones have all been Motorolas.

The battery life is another highlight. With moderate to heavy usage (watching videos, playing games, browsing the web), the phone lasts me from 5 AM until midnight without needing a recharge.

Recently their flagship equivalents have become almost as expensive as the leaders so I've had to look for a more affordable option. This phone seems to hit the sweet spot. A very capable phone who's biggest selling point is it's battery and charging. 120w charging allows 0% to 100% charge in 20 mins. And lasts all day with heavy use. Which means in practical terms I never have to schedule charging. Just plug it in a few minutes while I get ready to go out and it's done. The only feature I really wish it had is wireless charging if only to save the USB connector wear. But that's probably the only compromise here. Decent cameras, fast processor, good storage. Great screen brightness and colour though I'm not as fond of the curved screen as I thought I might be. I play a game which fills the screen and occasionally looks a little distorted by the curves at the edge. Not a big problem and it doesn't seem to caused inadvertent touch issues but I would go for a flat screen next time. Set-up was very smooth and quick, copying all my stuff off the old phone. I only wish that my app layout was replicated too. And all the apps didn't need to then be reactivated. But that's maybe just asking too much.

My previous phone was the excellent Samsung Note 8. I actually intended to buy a Pixel 4a but the Nord happened to be beside it in the shop so I had a play with both phones. Within five minutes I had changed my mind and came home and ordered the Nord from Amazon (I didn't need the £10 sim the shop insisted I buy).The Nord is a great phone. Samsung S series quality, without the price. I really don't understand the negative comments about the phone from some people. The build quality is as good as any phone, flagship or otherwise. The screen is superb. The fast refresh rate makes my old Note 8 (which has an 8 series processor) feel sluggish. The battery lasts all day, unless you've got phone issues (I'm getting 10 hours screen on time). The Warp charging is amazing (70% in 30 minutes - so fast that I can't shower and dress with it on charge because I try not to fully charge it every day). The wifi connects in places that no previous phone every worked. The operating system is fast and intuitive. It takes two sim cards if and when we can every travel again (or you want personal and business numbers in the same handset). You can customise it to death. It plays games well. Telephone calls are crystal clear. My Samsung Buds work better with it than they ever did with my Samsung Note. What's not to like?

P3 display makes most of a difference when watching movies & gaming.90hz is so nice coming from a 60hz S10+Unfortunately the one I have keeps over heating after doing light stuff like personal hotspot and downloading. Files/games when setting the phone up for the first time. [Since updates I haven't had any overheating doing light stuff but maybe that's due to the the heatwave going away].When this does happen everything on the NORD is extremely slow. The volume buttons take 1-1.5 secs to rejester a long press. The screen goes way below 60hzs. Also the 30w warp charging has so far from my experience has just been as fast as my 15w S10+. Taken a good 40mins to get to 50. Not what I expected for 30w charging? This has now been fixed due to sofware or the the heatwave. updates However apart from this when web browsing and watching movies etc. It's a good option for the average person. Also this NORD phone can game but just so you know that it will probably over heat so when this happens the phone screen will dim down a little bit. When I mean it over heats I mean that I will get a notification saying on the line off the phone is too hot and some stuff will be restricted till the phone cools down. As I use my phone as a WiFi modem all the time for personal hotspot the NORD hoverheats slot of the time especially on a hot day at around 27c+. again probs due to th heat wave UK had 31c plus for a week when i was doing my testing.  Hopefully this helps you out. Also i've noticed that at my work I don't have very little service and i'm on EE network. I'm unfortunately unable to play music sometimes or call on the OnePlus NORD. So i put the sim card in my S10+ and i could call, text, and load facebook and sometimes youtube with only a little delay. that makes me believe that the NORD over estimates the service it has evern though its a 5g phone. my sim is 4g.  I did my test running YouTube from 100% to 0% on 50% brightness and 50% volume i got an accurate time of around 14h 57mins.  30W charging most days gets a full charge in 1hr. so I advise NOT plugging it in overnight with the 30W charger. Plug it in with a 5W cable and 5W wall plug if you charge over night. What i do is wake up in the morning and just do all the stuff i need to do then before you know it its on 75%. I did drop the phone and it was on concrete and i has the case on the down side as the frame is made of plastic the shock just made a dent in the phone and the case as you can see in the pics.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sergey Komov', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 4 October 2022', 'Review Body': 'After last update 5G became unavailable.

It was possible to hide the the camera holes on the screen. The lack of a headphone jack is not as I thought it would be.

It's hard to find anything that matches what's on offer here in this price range, especially in the UK. The phone arrived in a compact box with a usb c charging lead but no charging adapter, which is fine, most of us already have a suitable one. The UK versions don't come with a case either, so it's really just the phone and the cable in the box. The phone looks nice, especially the vegan leather back option offers something different than every other phone. The frame is made of plastic and the front is glass of course. It's a solid built and it's comfortable holding it. I have to say these specs are amazing, the 8gb of ram is plenty and the 256gb storage matches many top of the range phones so it's certainly nice to have in a sub £200 phone. On top of this you can use a micro sd card up to a whopping 1tb if you want to. The specs are impressing in other areas too, like the screen which has 1080p+ resolution and 90Hz refresh rate - again a rare thing for this much money. I ran some synthetic benchmarks and I was quite surprised to see that the moto g54 matches the performance of flagship phones from 2020 which is impressive to say the least. Where it fell behind was the gpu tests where it wasn't as powerful, so that's bad news for serious gamers, but casual gamers should be ok. The phone comes with android 13 out of the box and the upgrade to android 14 is guaranteed, however no more major android versions after that. The phone will get security updates until September 2026 based on motorola's official site. It's promised to be bi-monthly security updates, but that's not quite true...the g54 came out in September 2023 and the latest security update available at the time of writing (May 2024) is of Dec 2023. So it's not perfect, but it's not worse than competitors in this price segment. The camera is a pretty important feature for almost everybody and my experience is that the phone can take decent photos, but they look quite processed. The photos are sharp, but in an artificial way. For me this is not a problem as I only use it as a work phone to take photos of jobs done and for that it's perfect, but it doesn't take natural looking nice photos as more expensive phones can. Performance is great in real life, although I didn't install many apps on mine. I only ever notice some stuttering when launching the camera, or gallery, but after a few seconds this stuttering disappears and the phone is good to go. Unfortunately there were some bloatware preinstalled on the phone but luckily all of them are removable. There is some degree of splash resistance but no official IP rating, it's still better than nothing. The battery is huge, 5000mAh, again a flagship worthy number, and it last days for me with very light use. Even with heavier usage, it should get anybody through a day I think. Charging is not very fast, but I don't mind to live with some compromises to get a cheap phone. I think motorola struck the perfect balance with cutting corners and offering a low price with the g54. You get an excellent screen that is on par with £500+ phones, enough RAM and plenty of storage. Big battery and good performance compliments the package. What is sacrificed is more major android upgrades, and the speed at which security updates arrive. The camera is decent for the money but won't be for everyone. Charging is slow too. All in all it's a really good value for money phone and I can only recommend it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'gra w', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'SIMS', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent product, good value.

I need my phone to be secure, so as this Moto g54 5g was Motorola's latest release at the time I bought it (released Sept. 2023 and bought Jan. 2024). It has great specs, and you get a lot for your money, £179.95 and down to £159.95 on January sale offer. It compares perfornance well with my son's Google Pixel 7a, which cost £370. The only major pro and con between the phones is that the Google Pixel 7a came with android 14, and the Moto g54 has android 13. I expected this to upgrade to 14, as that is this year's android release, but it hasn't upgraded yet, but Motorola say It will be soon. It does state that the g54 gets at least 2 major upgrades and 3 years security updates and support. So I'm hoping this does update soon. The Pixel 7a gets 4 years+ support, but Google phones always get their software updates before other manufacturers. While I'm on the subject of software, Motorola seem to have discontinued the excellent Motorola Migrate app for some reason. There's not much of an instruction book to show you how to transfer your apps and data. I quickly googled how to do it by a usbC to usbC cable, data, files and app transfer, but a pre installed app or clearer instructions would have been helpful. Apart from that, the Moto g54 is good, fast and responsive. I'm not sure the camera is any better than the one on my old Moto g10, and has lost its super wide angle lens. However, if I want to take great pictures I will use my camera instead. The phone camera is perfect for snapping unplanned photos.The supplied 15 watt charger is an improvement over my old phone, and gets enough charge in fast (10 minutes from 10% to about 30%) when the battery is low and you're in a hurryOverall, the Moto g54 5g is a great phone, at an unbeatable value price. There's not really any other phones from reliable manufacturers that offer the same specs in the same price range, apart from other Motorola phone models.

Las fotos salen muy nítidas, con una excelente reproducción de colores y detalles, incluso en condiciones de poca luz. El modo retrato destaca, logrando un buen enfoque del sujeto y un desenfoque de fondo natural. Los vídeos también son muy estables y tienen una buena resolución.Batería y rendimiento:La duración de la batería es sobresaliente. Con un uso moderado (redes sociales, fotos, y algo de streaming), me dura más de un día sin necesidad de cargarlo. Además, la optimización de batería es excelente, ya que el teléfono sabe cómo gestionar el consumo energético cuando está en reposo o en aplicaciones que no requieren mucha potencia. Para quien busca un smartphone que aguante el día sin problemas, este es una muy buena opción.Rendimiento general:El procesador es rápido y eficiente, manejando aplicaciones pesadas y multitarea sin problemas. Los 8 GB de RAM aseguran una experiencia fluida, sin tirones ni ralentizaciones. El sistema operativo también está bien optimizado, lo que se nota en el tiempo de respuesta y la fluidez de la interfaz.Almacenamiento:Los 128 GB de almacenamiento son más que suficientes para la mayoría de usuarios. Si sueles guardar muchas fotos, vídeos o aplicaciones pesadas, no tendrás que preocuparte por quedarte sin espacio pronto.Pantalla:La pantalla tiene una excelente calidad, con colores vibrantes y buena visibilidad incluso bajo luz solar directa. Aunque no tiene las especificaciones de las pantallas OLED de gama alta, el panel sigue siendo impresionante para su rango de precio.Contras:El único inconveniente que he encontrado es la falta de NFC para realizar pagos con tarjeta. Hoy en día, esta es una función que muchos smartphones de gama media y alta incluyen, por lo que puede ser un factor decisivo para algunos usuarios. También es importante señalar que no tiene una certificación IP formal, así que cuidado con el agua y el polvo.Conclusión:En general, el CMF Phone 1 es un gran teléfono en términos de rendimiento, cámara y duración de batería. Si no te molesta la ausencia de NFC para pagos móviles, es una excelente opción para quienes buscan un smartphone de gran calidad a un precio razonable.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Per-Oscar Svensson', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Sweden on 19 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Only problematic we had with it was the NFC part.

The colors are vibrant, and it has a sleek, premium design that feels good in the hand. The anti-drop feature is also reassuring.Decent Battery Life: The battery lasts well enough for everyday use, and the 256GB of storage is plenty to hold apps, photos, and videos without any issues.Affordable Price: For a budget-friendly 5G phone, it delivers in terms of basic functionality and overall look. If you\'re looking for a phone that offers good value for money, it ticks that box.Cons:Lack of App Availability: Surprisingly, some key apps like Instagram are not available to download from the Google Play Store. This was a major inconvenience, as it restricts access to popular apps that are a must for many users.Camera Limitations: The rear camera may boast 108MP, but it only records in 1080p. Unless you hold the phone very steadily, the video quality isn\'t great. The front 50MP camera was another disappointment, producing underwhelming selfies that didn’t meet my expectations.Slow Charging: Charging takes around 3 hours, which is much slower than many other phones in this price range. If you’re someone who’s always on the go, this could be frustrating.Software Permissions: The phone frequently asks for multiple permissions—more than I’m comfortable giving. Certain apps, such as those requiring location or call log access, won’t work without granting permissions that don’t seem necessary for their function.Subpar Speaker Quality: The sound quality from the speakers feels cheap. The audio lacks crispness and bass, so watching videos or listening to music isn’t the best experience.Game Performance: Some games don’t run in full-screen mode, leaving black bars around the display. This really detracts from the overall experience, and the software feels like it needs significant improvement in this area.Final Thoughts:The HONOR 200 Lite looks great, and for £200, it’s tempting. However, the lack of essential features, limited app availability, slow charging, and poor camera performance made it hard to keep. If you\'re okay with the trade-offs, it might be worth it, but for me, these issues outweighed the positives.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Carla Alaia', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 3 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Dato che stavo cercando un telefono che facesse delle buone foto ma ad un prezzo ragionevole.

The vastly improved specifications is a huge leap forward compare to the 9  Lite with only 3gb RAM, 32gb Storage, a 3000mah battery, and a 13 MP main camera.  Thanks to the the main stars which are the generous 8gb RAM and the whopping 256gb storage, this phone is extremely snappy and a pleasure to operate.  The 100MP main camera takes brilliant photos, while the larger screen and the ultra thin bezel deliver a much improved visual experience.With the unique Honor app DEVICE CLONE, I was able to transfer all datas ( including all my downloaded APPS) from the old HONOR to the new HONOR effortlessly using a C to C cable ( an adaptor is needed on the old phone as it is a micro USB).  The only APP that I had to apply more work is WHATSAPP, as I wanted all my contacts and chat history to be transferred as well.There are some drawbacks including lack of 3.5 jack, no internal memory card slot, lower screen brightness, and the screen is LCD and not AMOLED.  However, I can accept the minor compromise as I don’t feel like paying £100 more for these features found in the Redmi Note 13 5G with similar camera size, memory and storage capacity.As technology changes so rapidly theses days, the relatively affordable price of this reliable Chinese phone means that I can upgrade to newer technology more often without feeling guilty.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Shane', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The glassy finish is very slippery', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2023', 'Review Body': 'Excellent little phone!

But I persevered with it, and after a couple of days everything is fine and I'm happy to keep it. It just took some getting used to.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'R. J.

The screen size is perfect for multitasking and media consumption.Battery Life: The battery life has been a highlight. I easily get through a full day of usage with moderate to heavy apps running, thanks to the 5000mAh battery.Performance: For everyday tasks like social media, browsing, and video streaming, the Galaxy A15 performs well. Apps open relatively quickly, and switching between them is smooth enough for daily use.Camera: The 50MP rear camera is surprisingly good for this price range. It takes clear, crisp photos in daylight, and even the low-light performance is decent for a budget phone.Storage: The 128GB of internal storage is a bonus, giving plenty of room for apps, photos, and videos without immediately needing a memory card.Cons:Processor: While it handles basic tasks efficiently, it can struggle with more demanding apps or heavy gaming. It’s not designed for power users.Build Quality: The plastic back feels a little cheap, and I recommend getting a case for extra protection.No 5G Support: If you’re looking for the latest connectivity, note that this phone only supports 4G.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A15 offers solid value for money, especially if you’re after a phone for basic tasks, a good camera, and excellent battery life.

You don't get one with it, just the cable but I have plenty of chargers.  To be honest I have tons of cables as well and it wouldn't bother me if it didn't come with one of those either.Comes with the usual Samsung and Google bloatware which I removed straight away.  Rather than transfer all my apps from the old phone I started installing them from fresh.  Just personal data was transfered over.  Didn't bother with a Samsung Account.The speaker is far better than my old phone even if it is mono.The only thing I've found that was a trifle disappointing was that the camera doesn't support Raw mode which I prefer.  However, its mostly for snapshots so no big deal and the images it captures are just fine.If you want a budget priced phone then this is one I'd recommend.

With the swagger of a pirate and the charm of a court jester, the OnePlus 12 pirouettes onto the scene, ready to tickle your funny bone and dazzle your senses.Design:Picture this: the OnePlus 12, decked out in Flowy Emerald attire, strutting down the catwalk like a supermodel on roller skates. At 164.3mm tall, 75.8mm wide, and 9.15mm thick, it's not just a phone; it's a fashion statement, darling! And at 220g, it's as hefty as a medieval goblet, but twice as shiny.Display:Hold onto your hats, folks! The OnePlus 12 boasts a 6.82-inch ProXDR Display, capable of turning heads faster than a double-take at a magic show. With a refresh rate that goes from a leisurely 1Hz to a hyperactive 120Hz, it's like watching a sloth race against a cheetah, but with more pixels and less sweat.Performance:With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform at its core and up to 16GB of RAM, the OnePlus 12 is faster than a caffeinated ferret on a sugar rush. Whether you're juggling flaming torches or multitasking like a boss, this phone can handle it all with the finesse of a tightrope walker at a clown convention.Camera:Say cheese!

Let me start by saying that both phones are exceptional considering their price points. However, the A53 has proven to be a significant upgrade from my trusty M31.One standout feature of the A53 that has left me thoroughly impressed is its front-facing fingerprint reader. Unlike the M31, which had its fingerprint sensor on the back, the A53's placement on the front feels more intuitive and convenient. It's a small change, but it makes a big difference in day-to-day usage.Another area where the A53 shines is its screen clarity. Whether I'm streaming Netflix or watching YouTube videos, the display quality is top-notch. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, providing an immersive viewing experience that's hard to match in this price range.In terms of performance, the A53 has proven to be noticeably faster and more responsive than my M31. Apps load swiftly, multitasking is a breeze, and overall, it just feels snappier in everyday use. This improved performance has added to my overall satisfaction with the phone.To complete my experience, I paired the A53 with a Spigen Rugged Armor Phone Case. This combination not only provides excellent protection but also enhances the overall look and feel of the phone. It's become the perfect setup for me, ensuring my device stays safe while still looking stylish.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A53 has proven to be a worthy upgrade from my Galaxy M31. With its front-facing fingerprint reader, impressive screen clarity, and enhanced performance, it has exceeded my expectations. If you're in the market for a budget-friendly smartphone with excellent features, the A53 is definitely worth considering.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nicola Courtney', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Brill phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Really good phone, well priced, 5g, good charging, brill features really just a well rounded decent phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Londoner', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Replaces another that became a problem when local masts all failed', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2022', 'Review Body': ""This offers both 5G and 4G use and also Wi-Fi Connect should normal use be impossible.

You can install all the apps in the Play store, and get the full Android experience with this device.- NFC for contactless payment (tap middle of the phone against reader). Seems to work well even from a small distance.- Battery life is excellent. Two days of normal use is totally doable.- Screen is good. Resolution is lower than more expensive phones, but only a few people might notice some graphics are less sharp than mid-range or flagship devices. Text displays fine.- Considering the price, performance is decent. I don\'t game on my phone, but switching between apps is fluid most of the time, albeit loading times are a little bit longer than more powerful phones. Most apps are snappy enough to use without issues.- Location, GPS make using this phone for navigation easy.- Bluetooth pairing works well for music and other services.- Wi-Fi connects without issues.- Fingerprint reader on the side works reasonably well, and allows you to use biometric features in apps.But with the great value comes some drawbacks.- Camera is not that great. If you are a keen photographer, skip this phone. Image quality and camera response is not good.- Video is again, average. I don\'t recommend this phone for shooting a lot of video.- Screen is not that bright in sunny conditions.- Speaker phone (which I use a lot) is quiet, and seems to cause issues with the microphone, so people struggle to hear me when I have them on speaker.- Updates introduce new bugs and slow performance (I think this is common with Android)- Motorola ""features"" like the famous karate chop to turn on the torch seems less reliable than my previous (more expensive) Moto.So despite the drawbacks, this phone has pretty much everything you would need day-to-day.

The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too. But its a fingerprint magnet, so buy a clear case in addition since UK models dont get cases.

I don't really drop phones, but I ended up dropping this a few times from my pocket because of my wired headphones. (btw..go for Bluetooth...less stress) anyway, Yee, it cracked on front and back, I have alot of spiderweb type cracks from the light impacts on the floor and basically the lesson is to just buy a case, the phone is very delicate. But even after the massive cracks, the phone still works which is okay I guess.also, after using for a while, yeah, you notice the lag once you download a bunch of applications, so while it is I think 128gb, I'd say don't buy expecting to throw a bunch of junk onto it and expecting it to be as fast as the latest Samsung.

I was forced to switch to Samsung S21 (the latest version at the time) in early 2021 and had the worst experience - the phone just kept crashing so much even after taking it to the store and getting it repaired several times... and I had to get rid of it. So, switched back to Huawei and never looked back. Phone speed - amazing. Phone features - amazing. Phone design and colour - amazing. Memory on phone - amazing. Battery life and how quickly it charges - amazing. Fingerprint scanner - amazing. In fact amazing is just an understatement. I have always loved Huawei phones since getting my first one back in Spring 2017. I will try to hold out with Huawei for as long as possible (even if it means to continuously buy pre-May 2019 phones). Literally, what more can I say? I have had this phone for 6 months and it is still going strong.

I was looking at the iPhone SE 2020, however the difference between using that and my iPhone 11 Pro Max is too much; I\'m too pro-big screen now!Enter the Samsung Galaxy A71; I first heard about this phone from a recommended YouTube video, and after also looking at the A51, I decided to spend the extra and get this. I\'m glad I did!I\'ll go over the positives, negatives and experience compared to my main phone, the iPhone 11 Pro Max.POSITIVES. Very light - this phone is incredibly light for the size! It\'s very comfortable to hold in one hand.. Build - a lot of people list plastic bodies as a negative, but I like the change from the typical slippery glass back.. Amazing screen - the screen on this phone is incredible! It\'s big at 6.7"", and while it may not be 1440p, I find it very sharp. Colours are amazing - it\'s set to ""Natural"" tuning out of the box, but I set it to be more saturated and I absolutely love it.. Battery - at time of review I\'ve had this phone for a few days so take this with a grain of salt, but battery life is great. Lasts throughout the day with no issues, could easily last half way through the next day as well.. Fast charging - phone completely charges from around 30% in under an hour, close to 40 minutes. Operating System - Samsung\'s skin has definitely changed for the better! Last Samsung I had was the S7 edge. Lots of modifications to make handling such a tall phone easier, and the phone feels fast after changing the animation times to be 0.5 times normal.. What\'s in the box - if I had just been given the phone and a normal charger I wouldn\'t have complained since the value would still be amazing, however it comes with a fast charger in the box and a pair of in ear earphones!. Storage - 128GB storage is insane. The 11 Pro Max starts at 64! It does have expandable storage also, but I haven\'t used it as 128 is enough for me.NEGATIVES. No wireless charging - I really like wireless charging, I use it to charge my iPhone every night. No idea why this is a feature reserved for flagships.. User experience - this is more on Samsung/Android than the phone itself, but it just doesn\'t feel as smooth as my 11 Pro max. Even with animations set to normal speeds, some animations just feel jarring. Samsung\'s UI could do with some more polish.. Software bloat - this phone comes with a lot of apps pre-installed, where they could just offer the Google version (e.g. the Photos app). Also it comes with Facebook pre installed which I absolutely hate. Luckily you can disable it! On the flip side, some really useful Samsung apps don\'t come pre installed, such as Good Lock and Samsung Pass.. Speaker - the speaker setup on this is dreadful. One bottom facing speaker which is easily blocked with one finger. Should have gone for a dial speaker setup which is the norm right now.. Camera - this phones camera isn\'t bad. I actually like the versatility of the camera setup. What I don\'t like it how terrble the pictures looked out of the box. It wasnt until using it a few times that I realised that it doesn\'t use the 64MP sensor by default - you have to change from 3:2 to 3:2 64MP camera mode, which I found really confusing.. Performance - while this phone performs perfectly fine for 80% of the time, the 20% of the time that it doesn\'t it noticeable. Freezing when I go into an app (typically happens in Chrome), taking a while to realise I\'ve turned the phone into horizontal mode. Also there seems to be a consistent bug where I\'ll stop getting notifications during the later half of the day, for no rhyme or reason. I have nothing set up stopping notifications from coming in. Restarting the phone fixes this issue, but even doing so made me realise that I\'ve never had to do that with my 11 Pro Max.VS THE 11 PRO MAXThis phone makes me feel stupid for buying the 11 Pro Max. There, I said it.. While using this phone, I honestly cannot justify spending over £1000 for the 11 Pro Max, or any other phone!. I prefer holding this phone since it\'s much lighter, less slippery and I feel a lot less anxious - dropping a £300 phone would worry me less than dropping the Pro Max!. The display is bigger and more colourful, I actually prefer the display on this phone over the one on the 11 Pro Max!. I miss wireless charging so much. I miss the simplicity of iOS. Android is nice, but iOS makes a lot more sense and has a much more pleasant user experience. I do appreciate being able to play Pokémon Emerald on this though.. The camera quality and experience is a lot better on the iPhone.. Battery life is better on the 11 Pro Max by about 25%SUMMARYI may have listed quite a few negatives on this phone, and comparing it to an iPhone 11 Pro Max may feel unfair, but I really like this phone and it more than holds its ground against the Apple flagship, I\'m honestly surprised that budget phones have come such a long way; it shows that mobile phones arent developing as rapidly as they once were.I originally intended for this phone to be a backup/holiday phone, but I might just start taking it in turns, swapping my sim from the iPhone to the Samsung and vice versa.For the A72, my advice would be to add wireless charging and a stereo speaker setup, even if you need to charge a bit more. Keep the amazing display and lightness and you have yourself a winner.(Review written on my Samsung A71)\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'AnnaK', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Samsung phone at a very reasonable price for the awesome features it comes with.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 September 2020', 'Review Body': ""I love this phone already. I did have a huawei p30 lite but it kept pressing the screen above where I was actually pressing so I'd had enough and bought the Samsung A71 instead. It is definitely worth the price! Nice and responsive, great face recognition. Plays all the games I've tried so far with no issues. The battery lasts a good long while even when I do have battery draining apps running in the back ground.I love the amount of space to install apps, pics or vids! One thing that put me off Samsung phones years ago was the tiny amount of storage it had especially on budget ranges so Im impressed again and this is one of the main factors that brought me back along with the other features and the amazing camera.I love the wide angle cam and the macro camera they are something I'm not use to on a phone and the Macro really does take some nice close up shots of stuff.The phone does have dual sim slots but I have only 1 sim in at the moment so can't review that feature. Like others have said it does have a plastic back but it really doesn't make this phone feel cheap at all and most of the time I have a case on anyway as I'm notorious for dropping phones!Speaking of dropping I have dropped the phone about 5 times from chair height and so far it is in one piece still and no cracks but I do have a case😆UPDATE 2022: This beauty of a phone is still going! Also been dropped about 1000x in the 2 years but barely a scratch. There are a few tiny weeny scratches from not having a phone case with a front cover over and been stuck in jeans pocket all day but they are only visible when the screen is off and looking really close up! ♥️ This phone, it will be put in a display cabinet when it is finally put to rest 🤣\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Michael E', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good all-rounder.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2020', 'Review Body': ""I've been a loyal Oneplus supporter for a long time, been using a Oneplus 3 for many years but I didn't like the curved screens on the new phones. I really needed a bigger capacity phone than my Oneplus. Decided to go for a A71 for its features and price. I've been using this since March. The positives, it's a big phone but I actually prefer that, the OLED screen is great. I had my reservations about the holepunch on the screen for the front camera but I don't mind it now.I got the 128GB model which is great for putting all my files on there and if I ever run out of space, it's got a microsd card slot. A key feature of the phone is the dual-sim card slot. I have one sim card for calls/texts and another for my data. I do save a lot of money by doing it like this. It also retains the audio jack which many phones have phased out.The fingerprint sensor under the screen and the face detection unlock is pretty good though more often than not, sometimes, it just won't detect your fingerprint or face. When it does work, it is very fast. It has quad cameras for various situations. I can't really judge the quality of photos. A photo is a photo to me.For the negatives, the plastic body is very off-putting - you can feel that it's plastic as soon as you touch it and I'm generally used to glass-back phones. I have since bought a glass case for the phone so I don't notice this anymore. The Proximity sensor on the phone doesn't seem very good at all. I have double-tap to wake and It frequently turns on in my pocket and starts dialling numbers. On the other end of the scale, when I pick the phone up from my desk and double-tap, it still thinks it's in my pocket and won't turn on.The biggest negative for me is the battery life. The A71 does have a huge 4,500mAh on board and the reviews and official specs said the phone had great battery life. I haven't properly tested it yet but I doubt I would be able to get more than a couple of hours of screen on time before the battery is depleted. Battery life just doesn't seem all that different from my Oneplus 3.Overall, in retrospect, there are some nice features on the phone but I wish I'd have waited for the Oneplus Nord as that's the phone I should have got. I like the premium feel of a phone and the plastic body on the A71 just doesn't do that for me.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Pammer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 3 October 2024', 'Review Body': 'Handy war super, musste es zurückschicken da ich es irrtümlich bestellt habe.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sabine bedzeti', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 8 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'super alles geklappt bin sehr zufrieden 👍\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stefania', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 3 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Ormai sono anni che usiamo anche telefonia Samsung e non c’è motivo per cambiare!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Cubacub jay', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 23 January 2024', 'Review Body': 'J’aime beaucoup\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Randobos', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 29 October 2023', 'Review Body': ""Acheté en remplacement d'un smartphone usagé.

Some would not load, which I put down to it being Android Go.Some apps would install okay, but routinely crash.The most irritating was that some apps (Microsoft Authenticator and other MS apps) would ONLY work if I turned off Wifi to use mobile data, whilst others would ONLY work if I turned Wifi on, so I spent a lot of time stalling and having to keep flicking the settings on and off to get apps to run.If you stick with the basics this phone is reasonable for the price as a basic phone, but if you actually want to use it as a proper smart phone, it's definitely under par.Edit May 2024I have been since been contacted by Blackview in response to the phone issues.  This speaks volumes to their customer service as they offered a replacement model due to my experiences.Unfortunately I have already upgraded to another brand due to a deal found, but I have instead been offered a refund.This is amazing service, taking their customer issues to heart and making effort to redeem any loss of faith in their brand.I was very happy with my previous Blackview phone, but having had 2 unrelated issues with their phones I had lost some faith in the lower priced phone market. Even the model I went for stretched my budget on a deal as I upped the price range as a result of avoiding the sub £400 market.I will certainly be looking at Blackview again in future given this level of service and commitment to their customer base.

Ace battery life, easy 1.5 days for my use (Twitter, YouTube + Music). The 512GB storage is extremely welcome. I actually prefer this over an SD card slot, as having it only on internal storage helps with app compatibility for playing large video files. Charging is very quick indeed with the included charger.Screen is really good, the high refresh rate is welcome but it's the colour profiles that do it for me. I like a cooler white for my displays and this lets you go as warm or as cool as you like, or tailor for your content needs like DCI-P3. The only niggle is the night mode - the minimum brightness isn't low enough for me, and there is a bug with the reading mode timer. It does not automatically make the display reduce blue colours at night, I find I have to manually switch. An annoyance but not a dealbreaker.Performance is excellent, MediaTek is back in the game with this chip. Handles the games I want (Old School Runescape and Pokemon go) with ease. It would be better if Pokemon ran at 120hz but I assume this is an issue with the game not the phone, it has the horsepower for it. App switching is brilliant, seems to keep apps in memory for ages. Fast loading of everything I use. The phone never feels hot. As with anything though, your mileage may vary.Camera is passable. The night mode is pretty good but you have to be patient with it while it takes the exposure. Macro is useless, I can't figure out how to activate it. Wide angle is good enough in daylight but forget it for regular room lighting. I would prefer to remove the macro and wide angle cameras and have a decent 4x telephoto. Don't be fooled by the design, in practice this phone has 3 cameras not 4 as the cooker hob shape would imply.I found the corners on the back of the phone were picking up the colour of my black jeans (the pocket inside is black too) but some pleather cleaner I use on the car upholstery works perfect on this. The material is lasting pretty good so far, no wear or tear I can see after I would guess 500 pocket insertions. Black plastic rails are absolutely fine with me.Comes with an included in plastic screen protector, which is welcome but I easily scratched it with my thumb nail. Looks like there are replacements online but I haven't bought one yet.The software gets out of your way and lets you do what you need. There's not much bloatware, a few of the Xiaomi apps have ads in them (the Security app for example always opens with an ad for me) but you don't need them to operate the phone. I have not had a security update since I've owned the phone, which is a little worrying. I doubt this will get the next version of Android. Don't expect any fancy AI features here like you see advertised with the Samsung flagships.Overall - just what I wanted. Price point excellent. Storage is fast and 512GB should now be the industry standard. Performance is excellent. Included charger is a bonus, double bonus it's so fast. Just don't expect software to get better.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mr A', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bought this as I had broke my other phone, very impressed with the quality.

The other positive is it's software - very fast and intuitive (inspired by iOS).The camera is good but not flagship so if you need the best camera get yourself iPhone or Samsung S24, also no 3.5mm mini jack and its water-resistant only to rain so if you want to swim with your phone look somewhere else.

This offering from Doogee was keenly priced and sounded good on paper. whilst it quickly became obvious that this is a more basic phone than it's 4 year old predecessor I've stuck with it, and got most of the annoying little kinks sorted out. The first issue I encountered during set up was the lack of British English available from the settings, I went with US English to get it going. After enduring an American voice and the lack of £ sign for several weeks I knew I had to find a solution. Fortunately returning to language settings revealed the required UK language. The other major issue I encountered was the impossibility of connecting the phone to my PC to transfer photos, etc. You could connect it and reconnect it as many times as you like but it just wouldn't allow data to be transfered. After a bit of searching I found a very helpful gentleman from India had added a video to Youtube explaining how to set up debugging and get a phone to connect properly, another problem solved. Compared to my old phone it is a little sluggish doing some things, eg screen rotation, however as my phone needs are fairly basic I'm happy to keep going with it. The N50 looks much like any other smart phone these days, personally I rather like the colourful plastic back, the camera is ok for daylight use and it has lots of storage space.

Of course while there may be, this stand works out perfectly, folds down nicely and the way it is constructed, the design and the materials used- I think this stand might still be usable after being through something like a building collapse (it would still stand when nothing else was ;). Because I have really been hard on this stand at times, traveled with it, dropped it- and it still performs the same way it always does.The other thing too, with me, is that I have medical issues in my hands and arms and a lot of the time the strength I have there is limited (and sometimes almost nonexistant)- so that I can still unfold this stand, fold it up, and rotate it- speaks to the great ease of moving this stand into the place you want it to be.

I can't speak as a former samsung owner as I never went through the exynos period of mobiles where battery seemed to be lacking but I did come from the nothingphone (1) which is considered a midtier mobile and I can see differences between the two.I'll start of with my previous phone, the nothing phone (1) which was the gimmick phone with the clear back and lights released july 2022 and actually it's been a decent phone. The battery life was really good and would typically last about a day and often longer so seemed to pair well with the seven series chip that it was using, It was a good phone but NOTHING much more to say. The Thing I didn't like about the phone was the quality control, I spoted dust underneath the near glass panel meaning it was either there on purchase or over time slipped in and was there to stay, there are other reports of this as well as screen issues and with glyph lights. The overall feel of the phone in the hand was ok but there was something hollow about it and a sense that it was going to fall apart eventually.Although unnecessary I decided I wanted something a bit smaller from a more reputible brand with quality products. I've had samsung devices in the past such as the Tab S7+ and was very impressed with the quality then so I made the plunge to buy the S23. The first thing I notice on arrival is the quality difference between nothing and the S23 just by holding it. There were no sharp edges (those complaining of such have never experienced a sharp edge clearly), the weight although heavy for some is appreciated by myself as it's typically a sign of quality, the frame feels far more sturdy and grippy and the glass backing repells fingerprinters well and doesn't feel cheap, so far so good.The software/GUI, One UI 5.1 is really enjoyable to use and looks neat with everything easily accessible and customizable (Except playstore icons! argh!) aside from that really nice to use. The one problem I do have however is out of the box bloatware, I don't know why typically asian brands load their devices with unwanted apps, (Xiaomi does it as well) fortunately it isn't hard to uninstall them and I appreciate that they don't force us to have these perminately.I want to be fair on the phone in regards to the battery because I understand the type of device i've come from and moved onto and it's my own choice in doing so. If i'm comparing battery with the nothing phone it does lose as I will typically get over a day of use from nothing and maybe 10hrs+ from the S23. It all comes down to my typical use case but that is what happens when you go from a phone with 4500mAh with a midtier processor to 3900mAh with a toptier processor. I wanted the smaller phone and will need to put up with the smaller battery, something I will adapt and get used to. Considering the phones nice size however I am happy with the use I get from it and the software seems well optimized.The S23 cameras are really nice, will they be the best? no of course not there will always be better cameras out there, The S23 ultra for example will have better cameras because it's even more of a premium phone with better goodies built in. That said the S23 takes some really nice clear imagery without a ridiculous amount of processing, I can tell there's some slight sharpening but not terrible levels. In the end it makes great photo's in both lighter and darker enviornments. (Photo's taken using 3:4 50MP, scene optimizer off, effects off)I'm sure there are other points I can make but as a conclusion I would recommend the S23 to anyone who can afford it and is typically used to small phones. You will be paying a premium but in return you are getting a quality, well developed product that will likely last you years.Edit: I've had the phone for about a month now and it's still running well. The battery seems to learn your usage patterns and adapts based on that. I now get a day or more (based on usage).Some reviews complain of very minor problems which is simply put, part of being an android user and not likely down to the phone itself. If you want a very simple easy to use phone without a gram of faff, go to iPhone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dan Scott', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'I was in much need of an upgrade, this phone has done just the trick.

The set up should have been straightforward.  There is a computerised voice to tutor one in the installation.  However, when I tried to enter text (e.g. the Wi-Fi password) the keyboard popped up but I could not enter any text.  After much frustration I realised that to enter text I has to press a key three times (one long and two short).  Near the end of the setup one screen seemed to freeze as I could not get it to move.  Again after must frustration I realised that to move the screen needed a two finger action (in a manner of speaking).  My other gripe is the ringtones or rather lack of them.  Within Settings the ringtone can be changed.  However, the only ringtone available was the one already installed.  Do these phones leave the factory with a random ringtone or are they all the same?Having got these points out of the way, this is an excellent phone.  The battery lasts me about two days.  Charging from empty takes about one and a half hours.  This is the default setting of fast charge and according to Google does not reduce the battery’s life.  All actions on the phone are fast e.g. searching the internet and opening videos.  The storage capacity of 64GB appears to be adequate Bear in mind that about a quarter of this is occupied by the operating system.  However, I would suggest that use of an SD card is essential.  I live in a poor phone reception area and my last phone was near unusable to make calls.  This one gives excellent reception.Before buying this phone I researched professional sites for reviews.  The considered opinion was that the phone was adequate.  I beg to differ.  I have never used an expensive phone but fail to see what one could do better than the A40.  I believe that the price is astonishingly good.  Why pay more?Yes, as people have said the phone was originally for the European market.  However, this is stated on the box and the only “foreign” bit was the basic set up instructions which were in Slovak (I think).  Do not let this put you off.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nic', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Superb travelling phone beyond the EU', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2020', 'Review Body': ""Bought this phone for a trip to South Africa.  Any UK networks are horrendously expensive for anything so plan was to use primary sim for receiving those one time passcodes and other notifications then get a local pay as you go sim for data and calls.  In my case a vodacom. You need a South African friend to use their address but once that's done all is good.Swapping from an  edge s7 was very easy  including moving WhatsApp data  via the backup.  Something you cannot do with iPhone moving to non iPhone kit. Another nail in apple's  coffin.Primary use was data and my partner tethered her phone to this. We had WhatsApp messaging and calls. Emails.  Maps. Waze for live traffic  navigation.  Facebook and messenger too. Of course we also had WiFi in a large number of places so this phone allowed us to stay connected with our UK identities.Screenshot attached shows the two sim identities in use. Very easy to monitor data usage too by one or other sim.We switched off voicemail and diverted all calls to stop incoming call charges too.Very easy to swap between sim for data,  calls or texts with both sim receive regardless.The wide angle camera was quite useful especially sharing vistas with those back home and posting on Facebook.It's not a water resistant phone one of the few disadvantages.

I poked around and didn't want anyhting very fancy - I don't spend masses of time on a mobile but I did want wi-fi calling and a decent battery life, get fed up with charging things every two minutes these days. Liked the look of the Mokia and took a punt, glad I did so far it has exceeded my expectations -although since i came from a S4micro but that is inevitable! Battery life has been excellent, all my apps have worked, camera ios perfectly adequate for me, and it has a FM radio which I use when I am down at my allotment, Only minor con I have encountered is an occasional unwillingness to reconnect to the house wi-fi when coming home - but its very occasional and I can live with that. Wi-fi calling is briliant too - not something I had before but needed in this daya and age of two factor authentication as coverage is not great round where I live.

I didn't notice any performance issues when it's working. It doesn't have the usual fingerprint recognition but I didn't miss that too much. Could be a dealbreaker if you need that though.In any even the real issue is the phone says the data is corrupt and needs a factory reset EVERY TIME it's turned off and on. Sadly this is often as it seems to get stuck on certain operations pretty frequently. This means you have no option but to do a factory reset and transfer files over again from your old phone.This seems to take longer each time. I've had the phone less than a fortnight and I'm utterly sick of it.

I chose the Nokia G11 as I had very fond memories of my old Nokia from decades ago and the price was reasonable. I have to say that I wasn't expecting very much, after all how good could a phone that was a tenth the cost of an iPhone be?First impressions are important and with a phone the first impression is the packaging. The Nokia packaging was very like Apple's, reassuringly sturdy and glossy. The overall impression was that this was a luxury product at a budget price. Then there was the phone. I was expecting it to feel plasticy and cheap. What I found was a phone that was nicely weighty and felt extremely well built. The initial set up was easy but it did take a little time as it had to download two updates, each of over a gigabyte in size but once that was done everything was set up in a couple of minutes. The interface, which, again, I thought was going to be slow and sluggish, was smooth and responsive. The only negative is the resolution of the cameras and it could have more built-in memory (although you can use an SD card to expand the memory), apart from that this is a fantastic phone. I don't know if I'll even get an iPhone when the next version comes out, I actually really like this Nokia.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tommes', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 22 June 2022', 'Review Body': 'Ich schreibe hier eine Rezension für ein Einsteigergerät, nicht für ein Top-Smartphone, was 800, 1000, oder noch mehr Euros kostet...Ich habe es angeschafft als Ersatz für ein Nokia 4.2, was leider einen Displayschaden hatte.

It's nippy enough for all the basic apps and even a few simple games.It feels nice in the hand, solid and well built, but not too heavy.Looks wise, it's much like any new phone, it looks simple but smart.It has a nice big screen, colours are actually great, nice and vibrant, not dull like some cheaper phones.In fact, other than the resultion being a bit lower than my much more expensive phone, I much prefer the colours and vibrancy of this screen.The pictures I included really don't do the screen justice, it looks a LOT better than that in person.It's alos plenty bright enough, I wouldn't have it above 80% unless I was in bright daylight.It's a clean android build so no annoying bundled apps/games/etc that you don't need.Wifi and mobile data speeds are good, it may not hit the max for 4G but it's still plenty fast enough for most people.The only odd thing was the lack of the usual back and home buttons at the bottom.  Instead the back button is at the top left and to get to the home screen you just swipe up from the bottom.To see open apps, swipe up but hold your finger on the screen and it will show you all open apps in a carousel.Apprently that is actually the stock Android back buttons etc, when you get on all other phones are actually designed by the phone manufactuer (even Google themselves don't use Stock Android, they developed a different interface).That's all a bit technical for most people the fact is once you get used to the different way of navigating the phone it's perfectly fine.Google Play Store works fine, all the usual apps are available to install (I've had cheap phones in the past that couldn't install many apps as they weren't approved for the device).That said, I can't guarantee every single one of the millions of Android apps will work, but all the banking, paypay, shopping, games, etc, etc that I tried were availble and worked perfectly fine.I checked the specifications with a few different apps that can determine whether a device has been altered to show higher specs than the phone actually has.I'm pleased to say this is exactly as advertised.6GB RAM (extendable to 18GB, this is not enabled by default so if you want that you need to change it in the settings, it's easy enough).  128GB storage, 720x1600 display resolution (at this price that's perfectly acceptable) and the display is 90Hz which is plenty high enough for most uses and games.Android 13 and dual SIM are also both correct.The 8 core CPU is fine and powerful enough for most people and not unusual at this price (Unisoc T606, I have a tablet with the same CPU), Android and all the apps I use run nice and smooth.I haven't tried the fingerprint reader or face unlock but they are there and recognised by Android.They even bundle a clear silicone case, charging cable and charging plug in the box, which many of the big brands dont do, even with their higher end phones.The only sub par part is the camera, but they do tell you the main camera is only 13MP so I'm not taking a star away from that, I knew what I was buying and so should you if you read the specs before buying.Still, it takes decent enough shots in bright light. Low light isn't great, but if someone is buying a phone and wants a great camera they would be looking to spend more than £70-100 anyway.All in all it's fantastic value at it's current £70 price, I'd say it would still be worth buying at up to £100, so if you want a bargain phone that still performs well but without a top notch camera, this is a solid choice, especially right now while the price is low.If OUKITEL do higher end phones with better cameras at a decent price, I'd even consider getting one for myself!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Raluca Sisu', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect phone for a teenager', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this phone as a birthday gift for my son on his 15th birthday.

I see no way to tighten or loosen the tension in the hinges, though that's not an issue at this point and hopefully never becomes one.I love using this stand for my tablet in the kitchen to either watch shows, control music, or hold a recipe page open while I'm cooking or cleaning. The swivel at the base makes it easy to position the stand facing me regardless of where I move to in the kitchen.It folds fairly flat for it's size, but the support prongs for the tablet at the bottom of the stand are immobile and about double the width of the folded stand overall. I don't know if I'd throw this into my tech bag when traveling because of the prongs but it folds up small enough that I feel comfortable sandwiching it between clothes in my other bags to protect both the stand and keep the prongs from bumping up against anything else that's hard while traveling.

However, the initial excitement quickly wore off as several issues emerged.The camera performs decently in well-lit conditions, but it struggles terribly in low light, rendering it practically useless in darker environments.The battery life, which was initially sufficient for a full day, has deteriorated significantly. It now overheats frequently and barely lasts an hour on a full charge.While the touchscreen remains responsive and the display is bright and clear, the phone's performance suffers greatly when multiple apps are open or when attempting to watch videos. It becomes painfully slow and often requires a restart to regain functionality.Although the included screen protector and case were a nice touch, they couldn't compensate for the phone's overall shortcomings.

This is my first Google phone, but I've owned two of their tablets.I wouldn't normally pay as much for a phone, but with 5 years of OS updates, and 7 years of security updates (from the launch date), I worked out that the cost per supported-year worked out than cheaper brands like Xiaomi. Of course, this only works out if I can manage to look after it well enough for 5+ years.I also wanted to steer clear of the Chinese brands (Oppo, OnePlus, RedMi and Xiaomi), as they have started to use very aggressive power saving of background apps, which was causing issues when switching between apps like a browser and 2FA authentication apps, causing the browser page to reload. I'm pleased to say that I've not had any such issues with the Google Pixel 8a.The Pixel 8a has a good, clear screen, a very good CPU (same as on the 8), and snappy performance. Battery life is good, and the camera is decent, but I would have preferred a higher zoom on the telephoto camera.What I dislike is that 4G internet pickup isn't as strong as my old Redmi Note 10 Pro, and when in supermarkets I often struggle to get the loyalty apps to load quickly/at all, whereas the RedMi had no trouble at all.I also dislike that the Google search box appears on the home screen, and they don't allow you to remove it, and for me it is just a waste of screen real estate.The phone also uses an optical fingerprint sensor under the screen, and this is noticeably slower than the physical ones I've used, and honestly a bit of a step backward both in speed and security.Another thing that's a step backward is the lack of a micro SD card slot, and headphone port. If you're a music, photography or videography fan, then the lack of these may be an issue. (Of course all phone makers are getting rid off SD card slots now, so they can charge you vastly over the odds per GB for increased internal storage).Would I recommend it, yes, if you look after your phones and plan to keep it for 4 years+, but there are cheaper options if you only want to keep the phone for a couple of years.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Steve Harman', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""A new phone that's got great stuff that's backed up for 7 years.

This runs Android 14 and is guaranteed system and security updates for several years, which for me is a huge benefit as I only change my phone infrequently. The camera is excellent - a 2x true zoon and a digital zoom to 8x. The quality of the pictures has been very good and there are far more options for editing in the phone than in Android 9 - quite a revelation as to how phones have come on. Hand held long exposures are possible (for example flowing water) and on this setting a ""normal"" photo is captured at the same time. Useful to be able to compare the two and keep the better shot. There is also a wide angle zoom to 0.5x but this has to be used with caution as there is quite a lot of ""fisheye"" distortion. It will work better in some situations than others. The battery life is also proving very good. I\'m a light user and get four days between recharges (and even then I\'ve usually got 20%-30% left). The screen is crisp and sharp and copes in most lighting conditions, the exception being bright sunshine when it can seem a bit dark so making taking photos a bit hit and miss.Overall for me this has been a worthwhile upgrade and it really is probably one of the best mid-range phones available.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'david abengozar muñoz', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 29 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Buen teléfono.

I've had the main brands over the years but hand on heart I have to say this is right up there with them. There's been lots of good things said about Blackview and I have to join in with the praise. Id never heard of them until I bought the phone, and have in that time also bought a watch which again is absolutely brilliant and considering it was less than £20 I'm just gobsmacked, connectivity was easy to set up and all runs smoothly. My only gripe is WiFi calling does not work with the Smarty network, so I'm investigating another network. But all in all a great product with decent support in place.

The ""renewed"" phone arrived promptly, safely packaged in a plain cardboard box labelled ""Used-Good"", with a generic charger and cable. Cosmetically the phone is closer to ""Very Good"" condition, with just a tiny scratch on the screen not noticeable when in use. The battery was fully discharged when it arrived so first job was to allow it to charge to 100% which took approx 3 hours. I then checked all was working; this is largely intuitive for Android users but the user instruction manual is on the phone under ""Settings > User Manual"" if needed. The phone I received is running Android 7; the screen icons look a touch dated!Having made sure all was well with the J5 I immediately ordered a suitable phone case - I chose a Lihondar case. (I find my 20th century fingers and 21st century smartphones are not compatible, so having a case on the phone makes it much harder to drop and easier to use).I installed the following apps: TuneIn Radio, Mixcloud, BBC Sounds, The Revival Show, Internetradiouk.com, plus a few others. All work well although BBC Sounds does seem to suffer a glitch now and then. Commentary from the BBC sports website works smoothly. Battery life is perfectly OK for my needs, lasting around three days of on/off use with Bluetooth turned on. Sound quality (what we used to call ""tone""!) on the phone\'s speaker is actually surprisingly good - more pleasant to listen to than my main phone.In summary, after several weeks\' use I am very happy with this purchase. The ""renewed"" J5 phone does all I expected, the condition is very good and the price is reasonable.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Linda Woodward', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Didn’t work out for me', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'As a refurbished phone this was excellent, not a mark on it and good value I felt.

There are lots of unhappiness with the lower resolution screen but personally, I haven't noticed much difference. Conversely, it feels sharper than the S24U as I can fit more on the screen (eg. Smaller icons and text).Battery life is amazing and leaves the S24U in the dust. Based on a similar usage pattern, the Xperia easily lasts a full day.In terms of size, I prefer the smaller and lighter body as it is now much easier to use one handed. Fingerprint unlock sensor is also much faster and snappier.Photo quality is fairly similar. The Xperia takes more realistic photos but the S24U looks brighter and, in some scenarios, makes the photos look better. However without comparing them side by side, both phones take amazing photos.Performance is a little slower than the S24U, but I understand it is to prolong battery life. It also helps with heat management as I haven't noticed much overheating except when gaming for long periods.Overall, the Xperia 1 VI provides a much better user experience and is worth the price premium.\nRead more""}]",120 Hz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

Showcasing a catalogue of awe-inspiring features, this phone doesn't just meet expectations—it surpasses them.The first thing that strikes you about the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is its blazing-fast performance. Multitasking and app usage are seamless experiences, reinforcing the device's superiority. Its multimedia capabilities don't disappoint either—with brilliant picture quality and immersive sound, it’s tailor-made for a top-tier media consumption experience.OnePlus's collaboration with the esteemed camera company, Hasselblad, has culminated in a unique Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. This partnership has accelerated innovation in mobile photography, featuring natural color calibration. The potent combination of a primary 48 MP camera, a 50 MP ultra-wide camera, a telephoto lens, and a monochrome camera guarantees breathtaking photos. This impressive camera suite shines even in challenging, low-light conditions.But the delights of the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G are not confined to photography. The smartphone features a 6.7-inch Smart 120Hz AMOLED display, enriched with LTPO technology, delivering a fluid and vivid viewing experience. Remarkably, the display achieves a 120Hz refresh rate while consuming up to 50% less power—an undeniable testament to its superior engineering.The innovative Warp Charge technology is another standout feature. Equipped with a 4500 mAh battery, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G exhibits astonishing charging speeds—jumping from 1% to 70% in a mere 30 minutes with Warp Charge 65T. Not to be outdone, the wireless charging capability is equally fast, promising a full day's worth of power in just 15 minutes.Under the hood, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform, delivering a 25% boost in overall performance over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 865. It operates on OxygenOS 11, known for its clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.However, perfection is elusive, and the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is not exempt from minor shortcomings. Users have reported occasional bugs and issues with the Oxygen OS, although these are likely to be addressed in forthcoming updates. The placement of the fingerprint sensor could also be optimized for greater accessibility.Pros:  • Extraordinary camera performance due to Hasselblad partnership.  • Fluid and vibrant display enabled by LTPO technology.  • Incredible charging speed, courtesy of Warp Charge 65T and wireless charging.  • High-octane performance powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform.  • Aesthetically pleasing design and excellent build quality.Cons:  • Potential bugs and issues with Oxygen OS.  • The fingerprint sensor's placement could be improved for easier access.In conclusion, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G represents the apex of smartphone technology, offering an extraordinary camera experience, unparalleled performance, and a breathtaking display. A few minor flaws aside, this phone is a compelling contender for anyone seeking a flagship device with state-of-the-art features. It delivers on its promises, making it a worthy addition to the top tier of the smartphone market.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone at a bargain price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Great phone and a bargain at £209 through Amazon on Prime day.

Good hardware still needs good software and in this regard Oneplus have failed with their android 12 roll out. After 3 beta tests the stable release broke some essential features (like mobile signal...) And removed some existing ones (One plus have now withdrawn the update for further work). If you need a new phone get a pixel 6 or an S21 instead.Old review:Good things (coming from an s20 ultra)-Latest Snapdragon chip-The matte finish on the back is better than shiny glass.-Fingerprint reader is very fast and much more accurate than my last phone.-Oxygen OS is close enough to stock android to use as is (sooo much better than One UI).-Supplied wired charger is superfast!-Camera is pretty good so far. I prefer not having super saturated photos as I did with the s20 ultra.-Comes with a case-Battery life is good, the phone lasts me the day.-Cheaper than a Samsung-The whole throttling thing-Despite that it can get quite hot under heavy load.-One+ are apparently merging oxygen OS with Colour OS and future updates will be based on that.-Not much clarity on the number of OS updates for the device (Samsung are actually good at this now, how things change).-No SD card slot or headphone jack.I guess I'm happy enough. I think the days of new phones surprising with design or new features are long gone.

Ich selber bin eiglentlich einer der immer das neuste vom neusten und beste vom besten haben muss, überhaupt im Bereich der Elektronik bzw. bei meinem PC. Wenn es um ein Smartphone geht, bin ich relativ genügsam, da ich nicht die höchsten Anforderungen an ein neues Smartphone stelle.Es muss reaktionsschnell sein, gute Fotos schießen und kleinere Spiele flüssig darstellen und das alles macht das oneplus 9 Pro problemlos. Mit meiner Spiegelreflexkamera kann das Smartphone zwar nicht mithalten aber das erwarte ich mir auch nicht. Im Vergleich zu dem oneplus 7 Pro, ist das 9 Pro noch ein wenig stärker und die 120Hz machen sich im Vergleich zu den 90 beim 7 Pro, alleine beim scrollen bemerkbar. Einfach nur sehr flüssig und geschmeidig. Nebenbei wird das oneplus 9 Pro auf Leistung nicht so heiß wie das 7 Pro, was auch ein sehr guter positiver Effekt ist. Das Display ist gestochen scharf und bietet etwas mehr Helligkeit als das 7 Pro. Die HDR Leistung ist bei dem 9 Pro ebenfalls um einiges besser.Da viele Leute die Akkulaufzeit als den größten Kritikpunkt des 9 Pro's betrachten, war ich schon sehr gespannt wie dieser ausfällt und ich war eigentlich positiv überrascht. Der Akku hält bei minimaler Benutzung ca. 3 Tage. Bei normaler Benutzung, also hin und wieder Spielen und im Internet Surfer ca. 2 Tage und bei starker Benutzung etwas unter einen Tag. Insgesamt ist der Akkuverbrauch im Gegensatz zu meinem 7 Pro aber gleichauf, somit habe ich hier nicht wirklich etwas zu kritisieren.Das oneplus 9 Pro ist einfach nochmal ein verbessertes 7 Pro und in allen Belangen ein wenig besser.

It has a gorgeous 6.2-inch display, a powerful Tensor G3 chip and a camera that consistently takes stunning photos - It may not have a fancy lenses from Leica but the software behind the photo processing is incredible and the results are fantastic. The 8 is also incredibly secure, with a robust security system that will keep your personal data safe. I'm confident that my information is well-protected when I'm using this phone. I have switched from Xiaomi 13 and the switch itself was a breeze - initially its doable over the wifi, but the content transfer (photos, videos, etc) been done via the usb-c cable, as you can see at the attached photo. I've noticed, the phone gets a mixed reviews but it may come from the fact, that people don't know how to use all the features. Personally I think it one of the best phones currently available, may compete with the flagships but costs a fraction.The only downsides are the smaller battery and slower charging speed, but these are minor issues compared to the Pixel 8's overall 'awesomeness'.

Not usable for purpose.I recently got my hands on the Google Pixel 8 and have had a mixed experience. Let me share my personal insights:The Good:Vanilla Android: The clean, uncluttered Android experience is a breath of fresh air. It's efficient, user-friendly, and offers a pure Google experience without any bloatware.Camera: The camera lives up to the Pixel's reputation. It captures stunning images with great detail and color accuracy, making it a joy for photography enthusiasts like myself.Dual SIM Capability: This is a big plus for me as I have business number. Having the ability to use two SIMs simultaneously is incredibly convenient.Size: The compact size of the Pixel 8 is perfect for one-handed use. It fits comfortably in my pocket and feels great to hold.The Bad:Battery Life: This has been a significant letdown. The battery drains quickly, and I find myself needing to charge the phone more often than I'd like.Random Disconnects from Mobile Internet: Thephone unexpectedly looses mobile internet connectivity, which is incredibly disappointing.Poor Reception: Surprisingly, my old Moto G, which was significantly cheaper, had better reception. This was a bit of a shock, considering the Pixel's premium status.Patchy Android Experience: While I love the clean Android interface, there have been occasional lags and glitches. I'm hopeful that a future update will resolve these issues.Stripped Down Camera Tech Compared to Pro Model: As much as I appreciate the camera quality, knowing that the Pro model has significantly more advanced technology does make me feel like I'm missing out on the best Pixel camera experience.In conclusion, the Google Pixel 8 is a bit of a mixed bag. While it excels in camera quality, software, and form factor, it falls short in battery life, connectivity, and reception. It's a phone with great potential, but these drawbacks are something to consider before making a purchase.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dip Sankar Das', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best smartphone within budget', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Pros : Best smartphone ever I have used within budget.

It has a good battery life - she's getting about 36 hours between charges - and charges fully from 0 in just under 2 hours. 9gb of RAM is more than enough for her needs and 128gb of internal storage is amble as she uploads her photos to our cloud accounts but you can expand up to 1tb. That reminds me of the only real weakness to this phone - the main camera is only 13mps but we've found it works well enough on day to day shots. More than capable phone at a very tasty price\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MYCHYKAMYCHYKA', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect phone for my needs', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'I recently purchased the DOOGEE N55, and it has quickly become my go-to device, especially when traveling. One of the standout features is its dual SIM capability, which is perfect for someone like me who frequently switches between different networks while traveling internationally. The phone seamlessly manages both SIM cards, and I’ve never experienced any issues with signal strength, even in remote areas. The signal reception is consistently strong, ensuring I can stay connected no matter where I am.Another huge advantage is the 128 GB of internal memory. I can store all my travel photos, videos, apps, and documents without worrying about running out of space. It’s great not having to constantly delete things or juggle between storage options. Everything I need is right there on my phone, which makes life a lot easier, especially on the road.The battery life on the DOOGEE N55 is outstanding. I can go an entire day of heavy usage – taking photos, using GPS, browsing the web, and making calls – without needing to recharge. This is a major plus for travel days when finding a charging spot can be a hassle. I never have to worry about my phone dying in the middle of the day.Overall, the DOOGEE N55 is the perfect travel companion. It’s reliable, with excellent signal strength, plenty of storage, and a battery that lasts all day. The dual SIM feature is incredibly useful for managing different networks, and the phone’s performance has been flawless. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dependable phone for travel and everyday use!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Bit big in hand.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Good clear screen, quality photos, easy to navigate.

This Phone is going to Replace my Existing ""Big Name"" handset!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'So, I was looking for a second phone to use as a backup. I was, however, horrified at the prices of contract free phones equivalent to my existing device. I ended up choosing this Doogee N55 purely on its price and promised features.I really had never heard of this device before, and really did not know what to expect.When it arrived, I was immediately taken aback by its build. It is sturdy, and a significant piece of kit. Setting it up was as easy as any Android, and the 14 OS is the very latest one can get.I quickly worked my way through the settings, and was stunned to find that it was easily the equivalent of my much higher priced existing handset, with the possible exception of the camera—but, if you are like me and 99.9% of the rest of humanity, and not a professional photographer, you would not even know.Basically, this phone has everything you need, at a price which makes it extremely attractive and affordable.If you are, like me, an average user just looking for a good, new phone, to take calls, check emails, check social media, browse, email, and take holiday snaps, then I cannot recommend this phone highly enough. In fact, when my “other” phone expires, I am simply going to replace it with this handset.

He was using a Blackview phone already, a tuff, old-style button phone.  But as things have changed in recent years with mobile networks, a log of txts weren't making it to him (I'm guessing it's down to txt encryptions that are now implemented).  Stuck behind the times, he seriously needed this upgrade.As many of us are aware, specs of a new phone matter.  You choose a device with say 32GB, then you'll more than likely lose over half of that space to the operating system.  The smallest size you should look for should be anywhere upwards of 128GB, with a RAM of at least 8GB.  The higher you go with the RAM, the faster you'll find your device.  These are really the basics you should look for in your device, which makes this phone perfect, and has double the RAM!With these specs, the processor will do the rest, and this is shipped with a T616 processor.  Does that mean anything to me?  Not at all.  But seriously, you're not going to pack something rubbish into a phone when everything else is on point.Charging is key, and having rapid/fast charge should be what you look for in any phone these days.The camera is pretty standard, with excellent megapixel rear camera, and your standard lower megapixel front camera.  This is pretty much the same with any device.  But a 50MP camera on the rear is quite impressive.So, back to my friend.  I helped him set up his new device, and I was very quickly impressed with the build quality, huge screen size, and simply how fast the device was.  He was immediately impressed with getting a full charge in a single hour of charging!  Although he's only been using the device for a month, he's still learning, he hasn't said one single bad thing about it.  Pretty impressive for £119.99!I'm so impressed that my upgrade will most likely be a Blackview!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Bradley', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent phone for the price .

Many complimented the colour and said it ""looked expensive"" similar to an A55 and S24. Battery life also runs a marathon, leaps and bounds ahead of my flip 4. 5G mobile data speeds is impressive. Call quality is decent. SD card & 3.5mm jack is present here which feels nostalgic. The beautiful 90hz Amoled Display is bright, vibrant & crisp. The screen easily beats out many budget devices that uses LCD panels.However there is a caveat...The heavy software plus low 4GB RAM makes this A15 5g struggle to keep up. For example, I can only keep one app open at a time. Otherwise apps may force close down and refresh in the background. Apps also take quite a bit longer to load. I still experienced some slow downs using this device despite clearing memory, restarting and deleting junk apps.  Having 6GB base RAM OR even a 8GB RAM option would have been nicer.I could see why this is priced as it is. Some basic features like screen record, always On Display, dual speakers are missing here. Also WiFi connectivity on this phone disappoints, you need to be close to the router otherwise the phone may struggle to establish a connection even 2-3 few walls away.Cameras on the other hand seems fine. This A15 takes awesome pictures in good lighting. 50MP mode in particular produces sharp images. Camera quality falls apart when in low light though, which is to be expected. Video quality is ok and usable in good lighting. Unfortunately yet again, the camera app can be very choppy at times.Honestly, for a £150 phone it\'s more forgiving. I may sound a little harsh. However, it gets most basic tasks done. In some areas such as battery life, screen and design, the A15 can easily rival or even surpass more expensive phones. Honestly, the only real ""let down"" is the dreaded low 4GB RAM which does affect it\'s overall performance!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gwennie Wood', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'My husband was very pleased with this phone.

Here are a few highlights of my experience with this device:Design & Build: The blue color looks sleek and modern, giving the phone a stylish appearance. It's lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy to use with one hand. The build quality feels solid and durable, which is great for everyday use.Performance: The 5G connectivity is a game-changer! Browsing the web and streaming videos is fast and smooth, with no noticeable lag. The phone's overall performance is snappy, handling multiple apps and multitasking without any issues. For an affordable smartphone, it really does perform well.Storage & Battery Life: With 128GB of storage, there is ample space for all my apps, photos, and videos. I no longer have to worry about running out of storage or constantly deleting files. The battery life is another plus—thanks to the fast charging capability, I can quickly top up the battery when needed. It easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage.Camera: The camera quality is decent for the price. It captures clear and vibrant photos in good lighting, although it struggles a bit in low-light conditions. However, for casual photography and social media posts, it does a fine job.3-Year Warranty: The 3-year manufacturer extended warranty gives me peace of mind, knowing that I am covered for any potential issues that might arise. It's a great added benefit that sets this phone apart from others in its category.Conclusion: Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is a fantastic option for anyone looking for an affordable smartphone with good performance, ample storage, and modern features like 5G. It offers great value for money, and I'm quite happy with my purchase.\nRead more""}]",90 Hz,2 GHz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

Flip prevents main phone screen to remain relatively scratch free for longer than non-flip phones of this category.2. Large buttons are great for someone with large fingers (like myself).3. Sound quality is better than 8210.4. Reasonable battery life.Now the negatives:1. Absurd ergonomic phone design. Which design engineer was given a paycheck after designing the handleability of the phone? The smooth contours makes it difficult to even take it out of the pocket as there is no way to grip the phone. Opening the flip to answer a call is a mission since I sometimes struggle with it to the point of missing the call and having to call back. I get it that this is an entry level phone but surely you can find someone with some understanding of how a device like this needs to handle. Not that hard.3. Same goes with the volume button on the side, since there is no groove nor grip on the phone, opening the flip almost always will press on the volume button and reduce the volume. I mean come on, engineering has come a long way since early 2000s, this should be an easy thing to spot during QA review. If you have a QA team doing that to begin with?2. Sim lock - good Lord, why did you not have the press-fit lever mechanism that you have in 8210 included? It takes unnecessary amount of time to remove the sim from its current housing clip. Needless complexity.3. Sound quality although better than 8210 by a long shot but still room for improvement.4. Texting has never been my strong suit to date and I still resent it more on the old keypad form. But one thing that is glaringly bad is the UI that handles the messaging, this needs to be reviewed and updated as recurring text messages from same contact are difficult to separate as you scroll down, the date/time with each scroll down does not translate well enough for you to know where the last text ended and the new one began. I often get an appointment reminder from my doctor only for me to not be able to tell which day they said as there is a previous text coming in the way of the new one.Overall, the main selling feature of this phone is its simplicity and when you severely lack in the mere basic functions of the phone then you have a problem as a manufacturer. I do not care if there is a Facebook option in the phone or the awful snake rehash, all I want the dumb phone to do right is to make and receive phone calls properly and when you fail in that aspect then you have an issue.Much better experience then the awful 8210 but still a way away from having the ideal ""dumb-phone"" that gets all the basics right.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alexander', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Not the Nokias I remember.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bought this Nokia as a dumb phone for myself as I was getting bored and started hating smartphones.

However, the battery was getting bad and phone was so slow, after nearly 10 years, I gave in and got this phone, which is available cheaper via Amazon than with 'another well known provider'.  The difference has blown my mind.  Battery life is excellent (mine lasts for days without a recharge), storage for new apps and dapps is amazing.  It really is like walking around with your own personal computer.  And the price, well, this one was amazing too (should have done it years ago).  If you are looking for a very decent phone with many bells and whistles, for a very reasonable price (I got mine sim free, and just popped in my old sim into this one) - then this phone is for you.  NB:  To pop in your old sim into this phone, see the little silver wire (with a hoop on the end - you hold the hoop bit) and pop the length end of the (sturdy) wire into the tiny hole at the top left of the phone to release the catchment cubby where you can pop your sim card in.  This wire/sim tool comes with your phone in your box. PS: Don't forget, for just under 8 quid to buy a quality phone case to protect your new phone.  I got the Kuafcase for Samsung A13/A04S Case with 1 Screen Protector on Amazon at the same time.

But they still remain a bit too small. But she seems to cope with it and we have made the wallpaper a neutral colour, to try and enhance their visability.

He was using a Blackview phone already, a tuff, old-style button phone.  But as things have changed in recent years with mobile networks, a log of txts weren't making it to him (I'm guessing it's down to txt encryptions that are now implemented).  Stuck behind the times, he seriously needed this upgrade.As many of us are aware, specs of a new phone matter.  You choose a device with say 32GB, then you'll more than likely lose over half of that space to the operating system.  The smallest size you should look for should be anywhere upwards of 128GB, with a RAM of at least 8GB.  The higher you go with the RAM, the faster you'll find your device.  These are really the basics you should look for in your device, which makes this phone perfect, and has double the RAM!With these specs, the processor will do the rest, and this is shipped with a T616 processor.  Does that mean anything to me?  Not at all.  But seriously, you're not going to pack something rubbish into a phone when everything else is on point.Charging is key, and having rapid/fast charge should be what you look for in any phone these days.The camera is pretty standard, with excellent megapixel rear camera, and your standard lower megapixel front camera.  This is pretty much the same with any device.  But a 50MP camera on the rear is quite impressive.So, back to my friend.  I helped him set up his new device, and I was very quickly impressed with the build quality, huge screen size, and simply how fast the device was.  He was immediately impressed with getting a full charge in a single hour of charging!  Although he's only been using the device for a month, he's still learning, he hasn't said one single bad thing about it.  Pretty impressive for £119.99!I'm so impressed that my upgrade will most likely be a Blackview!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Bradley', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent phone for the price .

Apart from this small detail (I thought it was so common now that the feature did not merit a mention in the description) the phone is brilliant. They also came with free wireless  earphones. If it were not for the omission on the tap facility this would be a five star item.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Peter R. B.

Flip prevents main phone screen to remain relatively scratch free for longer than non-flip phones of this category.2. Large buttons are great for someone with large fingers (like myself).3. Sound quality is better than 8210.4. Reasonable battery life.Now the negatives:1. Absurd ergonomic phone design. Which design engineer was given a paycheck after designing the handleability of the phone? The smooth contours makes it difficult to even take it out of the pocket as there is no way to grip the phone. Opening the flip to answer a call is a mission since I sometimes struggle with it to the point of missing the call and having to call back. I get it that this is an entry level phone but surely you can find someone with some understanding of how a device like this needs to handle. Not that hard.3. Same goes with the volume button on the side, since there is no groove nor grip on the phone, opening the flip almost always will press on the volume button and reduce the volume. I mean come on, engineering has come a long way since early 2000s, this should be an easy thing to spot during QA review. If you have a QA team doing that to begin with?2. Sim lock - good Lord, why did you not have the press-fit lever mechanism that you have in 8210 included? It takes unnecessary amount of time to remove the sim from its current housing clip. Needless complexity.3. Sound quality although better than 8210 by a long shot but still room for improvement.4. Texting has never been my strong suit to date and I still resent it more on the old keypad form. But one thing that is glaringly bad is the UI that handles the messaging, this needs to be reviewed and updated as recurring text messages from same contact are difficult to separate as you scroll down, the date/time with each scroll down does not translate well enough for you to know where the last text ended and the new one began. I often get an appointment reminder from my doctor only for me to not be able to tell which day they said as there is a previous text coming in the way of the new one.Overall, the main selling feature of this phone is its simplicity and when you severely lack in the mere basic functions of the phone then you have a problem as a manufacturer. I do not care if there is a Facebook option in the phone or the awful snake rehash, all I want the dumb phone to do right is to make and receive phone calls properly and when you fail in that aspect then you have an issue.Much better experience then the awful 8210 but still a way away from having the ideal ""dumb-phone"" that gets all the basics right.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alexander', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Not the Nokias I remember.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bought this Nokia as a dumb phone for myself as I was getting bored and started hating smartphones.

The difference has blown my mind.  Battery life is excellent (mine lasts for days without a recharge), storage for new apps and dapps is amazing.  It really is like walking around with your own personal computer.  And the price, well, this one was amazing too (should have done it years ago).  If you are looking for a very decent phone with many bells and whistles, for a very reasonable price (I got mine sim free, and just popped in my old sim into this one) - then this phone is for you.  NB:  To pop in your old sim into this phone, see the little silver wire (with a hoop on the end - you hold the hoop bit) and pop the length end of the (sturdy) wire into the tiny hole at the top left of the phone to release the catchment cubby where you can pop your sim card in.  This wire/sim tool comes with your phone in your box. PS: Don't forget, for just under 8 quid to buy a quality phone case to protect your new phone.  I got the Kuafcase for Samsung A13/A04S Case with 1 Screen Protector on Amazon at the same time. Would recommend this phone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Steven Molyneux', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone...But!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2023', 'Review Body': ""Everything is good. However, I bought in haste, so knocking one star off may seem unfair, however, it lacks, what I think is a fundamental feature in today's world, and that is? Wireless charging. There is an add on you can buy, but it seems low tech and means it has to be stuck on the back of the phone and plugged into the charging port, not a good look I'm thinking.Screen is great, performs well, quality is good.There is one thing that's getting more noticeable and that's the battery life. I'm a heavy user for things like sat nav etc, and I like the screen brightness up high, getting old, so for me brightness is key, but it seems to drop to 85% quite quickly when turning it on in the morning.

She just wanted a  tablet for Internet browsing. This seems to do the basics very well. The speed is pretty fast and runs without any hitches. The screen responds when she touches without any fuss. And the screen size is generous. She also likes the tablets colour, which is a pretty, pinkish, rose gold. Working it seems straight forward and has been easy for her to learn. One small issue, is that the app icon badges, on the menu and home page, are a bit small, for someone with more mature eye sight. There are  options to enlarge them a bit, in the settings. But they still remain a bit too small. But she seems to cope with it and we have made the wallpaper a neutral colour, to try and enhance their visability. She has also purchased a cover because the tablet has a slippery surface.

I have a new one every 3 to 4 months or so due to my work. My personal phone is usually one that doesnt matter to me but i get decent ones. My last phone was a pixel 6a. Problem was very low brightness, rubbish battery (some days only 3.5 to 4 hour on screen time) and poor standby time. Sold it. Before that was iphone 11. Great battery and camera but only 4g and restricted user os (ios) i like to download torrents etc 😉 and few other probles with ios buggs etc. Before that was Xaiomi 11 pro. Good battery but adverts (turned most off but would still show every now and then. And a Nokia 8.3 wich was quite poor to be honest BUT decided to give Nokia another try as back in the 90s by love for Nokia was sky high. (I know this is not a proper one its a hmd global).So thought why not try the cheap g60.Im sooooo glad i did. Nice and bright LED screen,Very nice haptic feedback (vibration on keyboard etc) and very nice in the hand.After initial setup i was amazed how far mid range phones have come. Its fantastic. I know that every now and then the os stutters but i have the 4gb ram 64gb version but not as buggy as the iphone and not as too googley as the pixel if you know what i mean. The camera is quite good for every day pictures. The screen is bright and decent 5g and the battery life....... Well put it this way. I start work at 3am. Standby it does not go down. Screen on time ive got 9 hours plus. That by like using it as satnave with bluetooth, wifi, all apps running in background like fb whatsapp xda instagram all of them (i have about 70 apps installed) and have sdcard for photos etcIt really is fantastic. Its not the fastest but its reliable.Even youtube plays at 1080p without a hickup.

I bought this as a replacement for the X10 (a great phone) and had high hopes given the technical specs.It's a beautiful piece of equipment, as with all HMD phones. Not too big, nicely proportioned, sits comfortably in the average hand, and with a little notch cmfront camera that doesn't detract from the screen.It has all the features you would expect of a modern android smartphone, including a very decent camera (with a passable night mode for the price), split screen mode, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, etc. etc. It has a 3.5mm headphone port and supports fast charging by USB-c. All good stuff.But it's a bit slow compared to older HMD phones I've had. Loading up apps takes a noticeable fraction longer than I'd expect, but it's within the apps you notice the speed most - launching Google search bar is quick but it takes a good few seconds before the keyboard appears, for example. Small, but annoying.The speaker is also much quieter than any other HMD phones I've had before. Not negatively so - it's still just about loud enough - but it's a step backwards for sure.There are also currently (September 2023) issues with Android 13 that make it difficult to use. The screen won't wake after a call so one has to hit the power button and unlock the phone to end a call, the speaker volume drops randomly, and GPS isn't accurate enough to confidently log my walking distance each day.If it was a bit cheaper I'd be happy enough, but at just over £200 I can't confidently recommend it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'pamela l.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'For oldies like me this is great', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'This item arrived quickly and well packaged, having already owned a  Nokia and felt at ease using it etc, I decided to opt for this newer version.

Another problem with my old phone was that it wasn\'t compatible with my HSBC banking app. This is still a very slimline & compact phone, measuring just 76mm x 164mm x 8.5mm and weighing in at 190g.  It\'s a 4G phone which is absolutely fine for me.  It\'s not locked to any particular carrier, and can take 2 SIM cards (nano size), and a micro-SD card of up to 512GB.  It runs Android 11 at the moment.  Charging & data transfer are via a C-type USB plug in agreement with the new EU standard.  To transfer files to & from your PC, you need to go into the ""Connected Devices"" setting, & select ""File Transfer"" from the USB option.  Alternatively, just remove the Micro-SD card, place it in an adaptor, & plug it directly into your PC.  It\'s compatible with a fast 18W charger, which shaves some time off the recharge time.  The 5050 mAh battery is not removable (unlike my old C01 Plus).The front camera is 8MP, while the back one is 50MP.  Like all smartphones, it looks a bit like the Monolith in 2001, although the back is a nice dark blue colour (Nordic Blue).  It does have some advanced features like a fingerprint reader, although I prefer to log into my phone using my PIN.  Unlike my previous phone, this one IS compatible with my HSBC mobile banking app, and the Tesco banking app.  It also has a built-in FM radio with RDS, which I find to be a very useful feature!  I\'m surprised many boom-boxes don\'t have RDS, since it fits fine into my phone & MP3 player! There\'s space for about 25 icons on the first screen, which is fine, and you can have your less-used icons on the 2nd screen.  I\'m really happy with it, although I\'m not really a smartphone guru- but for me, it\'s more than adequate.  I\'d recommend this phone for anyone looking for a well-priced unit, of fairly high spec.Recent problem:  I\'ve noticed recently that sometimes my new phone can get quite slow, or even freeze in the middle of using it.  Sometimes it gets so slow that the only option seems to be to restart it.  I\'m not sure what the problem is- perhaps too many processor-hungry apps running in the background?  Another problem I had was that it wouldn\'t play some of my MPEG2 videos.  I solved this by downloading VLC media player from the Play Store.Lastly, the phone doesn\'t come with a detailed instruction manual, but you can download a PDF instruction manual from nokia.com.  Just search for nokia g21 instructions.Update:  My phone has recently upgraded itself to Android 13, which doesn\'t seem to me to have a lot of differences from 11 or 12, although the display may be a little more user-friendly now...\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'daisylousheldon', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Do not buy.

Nothing impressive and it's clearly a low-end phone. Think the Dacia of phones.It feels solid enough in use, but mine lasted maybe a year before the audio gave out. They repaired that and then around six months later the thing refused to boot and they told me my warranty was up. Which is disappointing when you consider it isn't supposed to be a 2 year warranty.

Even with the volume buttons disabled, every time she picks it up it is put into silent mode.The volume of the ringer is absolutely no different from a normal phone and way quieter than my google pixel.The app which allows you to get help remotely , is more complicated to access than what it actually allows you to do. So if she turns the volume down, instead of one button to turn it back up, she has to remember which app to press, wait for it to give a number and then navigate through menus to find who to send the request to which then is then sent as a text 🤷. Also it needs wifi so if its in flight mode then it will not work.The sos button on the back is good, but again needs to have a connection.If you want to truly advertise a phone as being easy to use for elderly people then you should consider that most people have mobility issues not just hearing or sight.

I then started to look at their phones and research OxygenOS and liked what I saw.I then discovered the Nord series - midrange handsets with near flagship level features/specs and started investing more time into it. I found out the latest Nord model would release. So after weeks of mulling it over and directly comparing the P30 against the Nord 2 I decided to take the plunge.I took delivery of the phone the next day and set about unboxing and setting it up. I was like a kid at Christmas. The phone came in a nice looking black box with simple blue lines down the side and the OnePlus Nord branding imprinted on the front. When you shine light on the Nord lettering and look from a certain angle you can see a multi-colour reflection.I then unboxed the phone which came with a screen protector preinstalled and a clear rubber case (when you set the phone down on a flat surface with the case on and turn on the torch the entire thing lights up around the edges and looks pretty snazzy) Also included is the 65w charger, red USB-C cable, SIM removal tool, documents and a very nice letter from OnePlus.Holding the phone in my hand without the case, I have to say it feels amazing, it's a really comfy phone to hold and unlike any phone I've held before, because of the materials it's made from. It's kind of hard to explain but it just feels nice in the hand. It's almost like a silky smooth texture with very slight roughness for grip.Anyway, I powered on and set up the phone, logged in with my Google details, ran all the system software updates and installed all my apps. I then went to settings to do some tinkering and customise the OS to a look and feel of my liking. Everything is easy to find in the settings and there's a respectable amount of things to customise for the OS (colours, AOD, fonts, wallpapers, horizon light for notifications etc)As for OxygenOS itself I like it - very fresh, clean and simple. And it'll only get better once 12.0 releases. It's currently 4 April 2022 as I'm writing this and I'm still waiting for 12.0 so hopefully it'll be here soon. A Theme store and more new features will be getting added, as far as I'm aware. Just search OxygenOS 12 to see the new additions.The MediaTek Dimensity 1200 chipset is as good as any on-par Qualcomm Snapdragon and can handle graphic intensive games like COD Mobile with ease - No overheating. No lag. Nothing of the sort that I've noticed. The MediaTek is a solid performing chipset and the glue that holds everything together. Great levels of performance with no noticeable frame drops or dips during gameplay or in general daily usage.As for the refresh rate the Nord 2 might only have 90Hz capability and not the 120Hz of some flagship models but it's obviously better than 60Hz and is pretty much the sweet spot, as battery life would suffer under 120Hz. You can have it in either 90Hz or 60Hz mode but sometimes the phone will switch between modes depending on the scenario. I leave it on 90Hz for the most part and it's fine.The FHD+ Fluid AMOLED display with HDR10+ makes for impressive viewing - sharp looking details, vibrant & true to life colours which pop nicely (you can change vividness in settings) and overall just a nice, big, bright, crystal clear viewing experience - games, TV series, movies and YouTube all look amazing!The 4500mAh battery with 65w charging is a godsend and will get you out of a jam, for example if you're short on time. I've put the Nord 2 on charge at around 15%, gone away then come back about 25 minutes later and it's already at 100%. They weren't lying about the charging speed.Awesome camera, too! Shots with the built-in Sony IMX766 Exmor sensor look sharp with nice accurate colour and detail, however some shots do look washed out. Night shots look decent but not the best and can look overprocessed and grainy due to the AI scene recongition mode. I'll admit I've been spoiled by the P30's Leica AG camera though (one of the best smartphone cameras ever produced) so the experience might be different for you depending on what phone you're coming from.As for Audio, I do miss the baked in DolbyAtmos audio from the P30 which gave rich, detailed and crystal clear sound across the board with several scenario based modes to choose from, despite only having the one loudspeaker. The Nord 2 has arguably worse audio on balance but it does have the benefit of two loudspeakers which does claw back some of that loss.All in all, there is more than enough with the Nord 2 to warrant it as a truly worthy near-flagship upgrade from whichever device you're using now, like me with the P30 for example (I know, the standard P30 isn't a flagship)Nord 2 is a very capable device and has something for everyone with its impressive spec sheet and range of apps and features. I've had the 8GB RAM model for 7 months now and its still hitting the high notes like the day I got it. I can imagine the 12GB RAM variant is basically Nord 2 on roids. I fully recommend you to get this phone, you won't be sorry!Thanks for taking the time to read this. I might come back with edits from time to time.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'staceystewart91', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Fantastic phone for price but has drawbacks', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2022', 'Review Body': 'The Nord 2 is a fantastic phone for it\'s price. For a mid range phone it is priced very well. The Oxygen OS is slick, customizable and easy to use. The phone itself (8GB Ram) is plenty fast enough for most users. Fingerprint is fast, facial recognition is fast, charging is genuinely fast. Like silly fast. Like you almost feel bad how fast it charges.However, the phone does have some drawbacks. The main camera (50mp) is good, don\'t get me wrong. But, it does come with some flaws. The 50mp lens is just that. No optical (this is advertised) but it also cannot digital zoom. You cannot change any settings (AI etc) on the 50mp lens, just focus/Auto focus. It does take good pictures but it will not be the default when you open up the camera app. If you\'re in a rush trying to take a picture of something, you will have to manually change it to the 50mp lens every time you open the camera app (unless you keep it open constantly in the background). So you are stuck with the 8mp digital zoom lens which is okay but I want my 50mp lens to atleast have a digital zoom.Coming from a OnePlus 6 with notification LED, I really did not realize how good a feature that LED is. I miss it a ridiculous amount which is hilarious and saddening at the same time. Downloaded an app for the always on display to mimic but it just isn\'t the same and does drain battery.Overall, a really good phone. More phone than most people need these days. It isn\'t a ""flagship killer"" but it definitely is worth the money, especially when there is an offer on.And also as an FYI, the phone does come with its own clear OnePlus case (actually a decent case, see myself using it until it\'s properly worn out) in the box which isn\'t advertised. Would be nice to know this before ordering a seperate case to just end up returning after opening the box.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ismail M.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 21 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Amazing super mobile phone\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MrR', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 23 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'Muy buen móvil, llevo años con One Plus y así seguiré, el mes pasado me he comprado el 12 y brutal\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MRicardo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 19 August 2023', 'Review Body': 'La pantalla encendida se come rapidamente la bateria\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fanny', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 10 August 2023', 'Review Body': ""Vous cherchez un compagnon qui vous accompagne dans votre quotidien, pas après pas, jour après jour...

For example chips around the casing and a scratch across one rear camera. After knowing this id personally opt for the excellent.Also the refurbishment process is significantly lacking - the phones vibration motor rattles and the phone can feel a little bit loosely put together just not as premium as I'm sure it would feel straight from Samsung.The front facing camera is also badly scratched and appears foggy when being used - it also doesn't focus properly.I would like to return this but have been warned by Amazon about my high level of returns - rather not coincidentally all refurbished phones.Amazon really need to up their quality control on these as it has been awful for years.All in all you get most of the experience but it just doesn't feel quite so premium.

It has an amazing battery life, screen, responsiveness and charging speeds that still amaze me.Being able to charge my phone at an absurd rate to 100% and then also getting at least six hours of screen on use despite the most suboptimal scenario (5g, High refresh rate and display settings maxed) is a game changer and quickly dispels any concerns about the lack of wireless charging.I can't fault the phone for it's beefed up and tactile vibration feedback, sound quality and display quality. But now for the downsides.The software is snappy out of the box but then does feel a little clunky or unresponsiveness randomly. This, I believe, is down to how the phone starts to learn which apps you use frequently, which ones it needs to not keep in memory and general system optimisations.Remedying this is simple enough, do some research into settings to turn off like ram boost, animation timing and other things to keep it feeling snappy.Comign from an older oxygen os version I feel they have lost a lot of the efficiency. So much so that there isn't a huge amount of responsiveness difference between this and my old one plus 7 pro. I however, welcome the amazing battery life that the 8 gen 2 offers and yes it will handle pretty much everything without slow down.For longevity I went with the larger ram and storage version. Just because 12 gb of ram is ideal to keep pretty much any reasonable amount of apps in memory (no power user can really multitask that much on a phone).The other major major downside is how uneasy you feel holding this phone without a case. Soemthing about the ergonomics and glass back make this so slippery. Just resting in your hand it slips, I had to scavenge some grip tape for the few days I didn't have a case just because of this.So definitely get a case and that's then completely resolved.Cameras. Another one that one plus haven't made huge leaps in. They've instead delegated much of the quality to in built filters and ai processing. Which maybe fine but the raw ability of the camera has to stand alone to produce reliably good, share worthy images. Something that they actually had done really well on op7.The overall verdict. It's a buy at this price and represents unbeatable value without compromise. Overall I am very happy with it. It's short comings for me could be fixed is subsequent software updates. But as we all know we can't rely on one plus to deliver efficiencies but thank fully can rely on them to support android updates - however well or badly they are implemented.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mohsen', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best phone on the market right now', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023', 'Review Body': ""October 2023 update:After using this phone for 3 months, I have to admit that photo and video quality is so mediocre, specially in low light conditions.

First off, the battery life is just mind-blowing. I can go through my entire day without worrying about charging it constantly. It's a game-changer for sure!I've heard some people comparing it to Color OS, but honestly, it's Oxygen OS and is packed with awesome features. The split-screen functionality using the side bar is just so intuitive and easy to use, much like Samsung's One UI.It doesn't break the bank like the Galaxy S23 Ultra does! Why pay more when the OnePlus 11 offers almost everything you need at a fraction of the cost?Also with a promise of 4 years of updates, OnePlus has really won me over. It's even longer than what Google Pixel offers, and that's saying something (if you ever keep the phone for 4 years!)There's no wireless charging or IP68 rating, but that's not a big deal for me. The 100W charging (UK) is insanely fast, so I never worry about running out of juice. As for the IP68 rating, who really takes their phone fully submerged?!All in all, the OnePlus 11 has been an absolute delight to use. It ticks all the right boxes for me - long-lasting battery, impressive OS features, and a reliable camera. Plus, it saves me some serious money compared to other flagship phones.

They did everything I wanted them to but my S9+ was nearly 5 years old and on its last legs and I refuse to pay £1000 for a phone that I can't plug my headphones into or get expandable storage which limits you to Xperia and the odd Chinese made phone.I have been pleasantly surprised at how capable this phone is.What I like:The headphone jack - messed with a few settings and was happy with the sound output in the endExpandable storage - which seems to work well with the Google files appThe battery can easily last 2 days in this - sometimes I have gone for 3 days without a charge. Although I must say its not exactly the fastest charging phone I have ever had but I wonder if it might not have better battery longevity as a result.This phone is very light in comparison to my last 2 Galaxy phones - I quite like the extra thickness. Makes it more pleasant to hold.I like that the screen is flat and not curved at the edges - I can get full coverage from the screen protectorWhat I am satisfied with:The screen is quite satisfactory even if it isn't AMOLED quality.The 21:9 screen ratio does have its appeals - most video is in 16:9 but for scrolling through messages or reading the taller screen does have advantages. I could see this phone being really comfortable for people with smaller hands or less strength in their wrists as some of the phones these days have gotten so big.The stock android is quite responsive - I have yet to catch the phone really laggingThe connectivity - wifi, 4G/5G, hotspot, bluetooth and GPS have all worked very well - I speedtested the 5G one morning and was able to pull over 100Mb/s down! This phone gets a similar signal to any other phone I have owned.The dual speaker sound output is quite satisfactory - the volume key has to much range. You have to press the button a lot of times to make large changes.The main camera performs reasonably well - I would say its almost comparable with the one on my S9+ The telephoto and the ultrawide are satisfactory but remind me more of the Galaxy S4 camera in terms of image quality. I did some low light shooting and had mixed results. Had to take a few to get a good photo.I have found the fingerprint sensor to work better than I was expecting. In the last month of using it maybe a dozen times it has hesitated to unlock although I think in most cases some grease or dirt might have been on it. Only 1 night did it really refuse to unlock with the sensor. Not sure why.What I don't like:So far the one thing that grinds my gears - I don't like the stock music app. I know Sony prefer to keep to a stock version of android but Sony also used to be in the Walkman buisness. Could you please make a music app comparable with what the Samsung one can do?Setting up a playlist is very cumbersome on this - every time you add a track it has to ask you to allow the playlist to be modified. The other thing that caught me out was there is no support for .wma files and I found out I have a few in my music collection from a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.I also wish this phone had a gallery app that worked as well as the Samsung one but I suppose that's a minor annoyance.Another minor annoyance but I think the headphone jack is better served being on the bottom of the phone by the charging port than on the top. The only phone I remember with this set up was my S5. Its taken a bit of getting used to.Overall I would recommend this phone. I will be happy with this for the foreseeable future for what I do with it. Mostly its for messaging, YouTube, a bit of light web browsing, music, audiobooks and taking pictures. I use it for hotspot/tethering 4 days a week as well. I haven't tried to do anything really heavy duty like gaming though.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mr. Christopher Meadows', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great upgrade from my Sony Xperia 10 II', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2023', 'Review Body': ""Bought this to replace my Sony Xperia 10 II, size seems  exactly the same but old case fits the phone but button placement is slightly different by mm . the screen quality it better, the camera is a lot better and the torch is brighter and the improved battery life is also soo good in comparison to my previous model.

It takes multiple attempts to unlock. the passcode option is unresponsive and sometimes does not register presses. There is then often a slight delay when the phone is unlocked, followed sometimes by the screen turning off again. For some reason the delay an unresponsiveness seems to lead to various button presses backing up and then being carried out in succession.The home/back/tabs bar at the bottom sometimes does not appear, so off goes the screen to be unlocked again, if it works.The phone freezes about 50% of the time when unlocked with YouTube of full screen.The phone completely crashed once when I tried to turn the wifi off.

If the phone hasn't been used for a day or was locked less than a second ago, you still get this random delay.- The camera's quality is pretty poor. Anything moving will be blurred heavily, without fail. The pictures of us meeting our first puppy are blurred and of shockingly poor quality due to the slightly dreary light and small motions kf the pup. The ones taken on the Mrs' 5 year old Samsung were so, so much better.- If you take a photo when the phone is locked (by double tapping the power button), it sometimes won't save the photos taken. There is no consistency behind it. Some pictures are fine, others randomly in a batch of photos taken at the same time are lost.- When unlocked, it would occassionally think the lock screen was still active, so I would have to put my passcode in when the rest of the phone is active behind it. Putting my password in would freeze the screen, requiring a full reset.- Wifi reception was poor. I had three phones next to one another at the end of the house playing a YouTube video on high quality. This phone, the 5 year old Samsung and a 10 year old Huawei. The last two worked no issue, but this one kept dropping out of Wifi and could only just play at the worst quality. Effect remained when other two were turned onto airplane mode so it was not a swamping of the wifi issue.I wanted to like this phone and forced myself to for a few months, but reality set in and I couldn't grin a bear it any longer.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'JORDI G.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 22 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Pràcticament igual que les versions anteriors però pitjor, perquè no disposa d'idioma català\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Martijn', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the Netherlands on 12 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""My first impresssion is a good one.

With its amazing battery life, tough build, and handy features, it’s the ideal pick for anyone who needs a phone that can keep pace.The highlight has to be the impressive 5150mAh battery. I’ve gone two full days without plugging it in, which is perfect for long hikes or those marathon work sessions. Built to handle rough conditions, the Blade 10 is both tough and dependable. I’ve dropped it on rocks and exposed it to the elements, and it’s come through without a scratch. Thanks to its IP68/IP69K rating, it’s safe from water, dust, and shocks.The display works well for watching videos, but it could use a bit more brightness for outdoor settings. The cameras do a decent job of capturing moments, though they might not be as high-end as those on flagship models. The dual SIM slots are super handy for juggling work and personal calls on one device.All in all, the DOOGEE Blade 10 is more than just a smartphone; it’s a trusty partner that can tackle tough situations.

It is very cheap for a mobile phone and it does the basics (calls, texting, web access) ok (see cons).2. The screen is bright enough to work with in all light and responsive to touch even with a screen protector on.3. The fingerprint scanner on the power button works fine and I have had no issues with it.4. It doesn’t come with a lot of bloatware installed.  Just Spotify (uninstallable), Duck Duck Go (uninstallable), Youtube Music and My Device by HDM (a device management app that just hangs when I run it).Cons1. It is a very slow phone.  Even opening Chrome and searching the internet can take a frustrating amount of time and takes much longer than my personal phone (a Google Pixel 6a).  I couldn’t imagine running any games on this or doing anything that is CPU intensive.  In short, the performance makes it very annoying to use.2. The stock operating system UI isn’t great.  The spacing of the icons on the home screen meant I couldn’t layout the apps the way I normally would on my personal phone.  Also, there is no option to adjust this.  I ended up installing Nova Launcher so that I could adjust the grid size and icon size to get the layout I wanted.3. When the phone is on speaker mode, the speaker is very quiet so you must hold it near to your ear to hear to caller.  This makes speaker mode pointless.4. The phone has occasionally lost calls, i.e. it just drops out/hangs up.  I cannot 100% say this is down to the Nokia, but I don’t get this on my personal phone and haven’t experienced it previously on other phones so I have my suspicions that it is the Nokia that is at fault.  Example: I Just had a call whilst typing this and when I went to hang up there was a message saying “call app not responding” and I couldn’t hang up.  This should not happen on a telephone.OverallI can’t strongly recommend this phone as a basic device for calls and surfing the internet due to the call issues and the slow performance I have experienced.  Given that those are the most basic functions you would want from a smartphone, I can’t imagine this phone would be much use to anyone unless price is the single most important factor when buying a phone.  If you want a solid ""workhorse"" (i.e. it just works and performs adequately) then this is not the phone to buy.\nRead more'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

È sempre possibile inserire una Micro SD per fare un mare di foto e video.Non l\'ho testato con videogiochi ad elevato consumo di risorse ma credo che un telefono sotto i 200 euro non debba essere usato come un PC da gaming.Usato con accortezza, la batteria dura anche 3 giorni, che si riducono a 2 o poco più di 1 giorno se fate tante foto e video, o se usate intensivamente i social network.Una nota di merito va alla fotocamera: sebbene 48 megapixel sul minuscolo sensore di un telefonino comportino per forza di cose una precisione e una dinamica ridotta, le foto vengono molto bene. Se poi sapete regolare ISO, WB ed esposizone EV in modalità PRO, potrete creare scatti ancora migliori. In modalità Fotocamera e a 12 megapixel, l\'HDR armonizza parecchio le luci e le ombre. Certamente non compete con una vera fotocamera o una refler, ma sul fronte ""foto"" questo telefono è abbastanza rispettabile. I video anche, HD o Full-HD, sono buoni, anche se non come quelli di una vera videocamera.Per i più pignoli, posso dire che a 48 megapixel forse la nitidezza è un po\' forte, ma se avete un fotoritocco potete ammorbidire leggermente le foto (effetto Blur al minimo) e renderle più naturali.

I didn't have much luck with the Samsung brand as every phone I've had off them has been a waste of money. I then went on to buy a Windows phone when they were first released, which was also a big mistake as the phones they produced came nowhere near close to the standards of android and iOS devices. With little money and patience, I decided to buy a cheap 'budget phone', a Cubot Note S. The Cubot phone was amazing, definitely the best phone I had ever owned up to then. However, being the idiot that I am, I unfortunately dropped the phone in the bathtub a year after buying it and that was the end of that. When shopping for a new phone, I decided that I would stay with Cubot as the first phone I had off them was unbelievable for the £80 I spent. However, I did want an upgrade, and after a little looking around, I decided to buy the Cubot R9. Now, the R9 was disappointing to say the least. It did have some cooler features compared to the Note S, but the performance was quite bad and let the phone down. I kept the R9 for 7 months before I decided to buy yet again, another phone. The R9 was getting really laggy and slow, the screen appeared to be water damaged from what I am guessing was caused by leaving it in the bathroom whilst the shower was on with the steam. My first thought was to purchase another Note S as the last one I had was the best phone I had owned, however to my surprise, Cubot no longer manufacture them. So I tried looking for another cheaper phone from Cubot but the cheapest ones I could find were £100+. Again, I kept shopping around until I found this phone, the doogee X60L. I'm so glad I found this phone, and I think it is now the best phone I have ever owned. The performance is great and really fast. I haven't got any games downloaded however, so doing so may slow it down a little. I have downloaded all the social media apps, along with YouTube and outlook ect. The picture quality is also amazing. Videos play smoothly. And the camera! Let me tell you, it may not be the best camera compared to more expensive phones, but it is definitely the best camera I've ever had on a phone! It is really sharp and can zoom well. It is also good at night when it's abit darker. The keyboard words excellent also, my previous R9 didn't have the best keyboard so this is a godsend. The finger print however, doesn't work in 0.1 seconds like advertised though. Don't get me wrong, it works really fast and is the main way I unlock my phone, but it could be faster, but for the price... I'm not complaining. The case that comes with the phone is also quite stylish, it is protective and also keeps the shape to the phone unlike some other brands (looking at you Cubot). The overall style of this phone is great, the doogee logo is small and unnoticeable on the back, and it doesn't have other writing on the back like other cheap phones do, this also makes the phone look expensive.  Now, this phone may be great, but it does come with some flaws like every phone does. Firstly, although being loud, the speaker quality isn't the best, this doesn't bother me as I use earphones more likely than not. But for somebody who uses their phone speaker alot, this may not be the best choice for you. Secondly, the screen protector that comes with the phone isn't already on the phone when unboxing. I was scared about putting it on incase I messed up but it was really easy. It would be better if it was already attached though. But again, for the price... Who's bothered. I have to keep reminding myself that this phone was £70 because I would expect it to be £150+. Finally, this isn't really a flaw as I'm used to it with owning cheap phones and it doesn't bother me, but, the headphone jack and the charging hole are both placed on the top of the phone. Apart from these things, there's really nothing else wrong with the phone.I hope my review of this phone helped you make the decision to purchase it or not.

Of course, it's not a smartphone, so there is no internet connection.

See the item description for details.I wouldn't use this as my everyday phone, but it's ideal to have as a back-up, if my own one needs repair, or if, as happened recently, a family member left a phone on holiday, and had to wait some time for it to be returned.I would possibly take this one on holiday with me, as I'm always a little wary carrying an item which costs over £1,000 in busy tourist areas where pickpockets regularly operate. The camera wouldn't be good enough for holiday snapshots, so you would also need to carry a small camera.Overall, this is a pretty limited piece of kit, but it is significantly better than I had expected.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'carolyn', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Disappointing', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'I know it’s cheap but the quality is poor and the battery wouldn’t charge.

The A51 is a very fast, responsive and great phone to use. Moving stuff from my old phone to the A51 was relatively straight forward with the Smart Switch app.I've found the significantly extra inbuilt storage of the A51 to be great, though once I'd transferred the 16gb of the J3 data across the A51 had already used nearly 40gb of storage; this must have been due to the in built stuff and functionality of the A51. Thankfully the mico SD card slot works well and I've been able to load the music from my computer to the SD card on the phone via a usb cable.The A51 is very quick in loading apps and data and whilst it is a new concept for me I really like the biometrics finger scan. This makes it a lot easier to unlock the phone and log in to password secure apps without having to constantly type in or remember passwords.From a personal preference point of view, the phone is a little bigger than what I'm used to or comfortable with. It has already fallen out of my pocket. This was a compromise I knew I was making since I saw the dimensions of the phone on Amazon before I bought. However when it comes to the extra storage space, memory power and price point this was by far the best value Samsung phone for my needs.

You can still use the edge menu on the A51It seems as quick to load things and generally once Smart connect had finished it was in the same layout as my old phone.What it doesn't have / down sides:It doesn't have an LED notification at the top. I liked the different colours, purple for Whatsapp, Green for Facebook messenger, blue for text and emails and a solid green when fully chargedThe finger print recognition though works ,it doesn't work with a glass screen protector (apparently some will work but I wanted the privacy one if definitely doesn't.) Which is quite annoying if I'm honest. I was used to the finger print being on the back on the S9+. Though being there I'm sure I smudged my camera lens on occasion.You can't wirelessly charge. A nice feature of the S9 that I thought would help make my charging port last longer and I used in my car, ultimately didn't help so again a nice novelty.There isn't the Samsung Health heart rate monitor. Though I hardly used itIn summary:Is the S9+ worth the £250 losing these features?Simply No.The fingerprint issue affects the later Galaxy models, I'm more interested in battery life and a good camera.

As someone who still uses the landline with no caller display and no digital phone book, she still gets excited that she doesn’t have to get out her address book and look up numbers, because now they’re in her mobile. It’s a great quality device, and it also gives us peace of mind as a family because she is in her 90s now so having a mobile that she can keep on her to ring someone in an emergency rather than struggling to reach the landline is comforting to us , and we’ve setup the emergency button on it too, which sends a few of our family members an instant text saying the emergency button was pressed, and then it automatically round-robin calls us while putting her mobile on loudspeaker so we can speak directly to her in an emergency. Excellent value for money . I can’t speak so much for the features, it’s a pretty simple device, but the emergency button feature is great (although I would say that it’s a bit difficult to configure that button, for a device that’s targeted to the elderly).

Per essere piu comprensibile, ho cercato di suddividere la recensione nei punti principali e quelli che probabilmente piu interessano a chi si appresta ad acquistare questo prodotto.📸\xa0FOTOCAMERA 📸\xa0Grande sorpresa per questa fotocamera, che ha in corpo 50Mp, e per un telefono da circa 200 euro non era così scontato l’inserimento di una tale capacità. La fotocamera principale è dunque buona per la maggior parte degli utenti, con colori che rispecchiano la realtà (Se usate sopratutto l’HDR) e che hanno una buona qualità complessiva in quanto a nitidezza.Non il massimo da editare, ma chiaramente chi compra uno smartphone di questa fascia non credo abbia intenzione di lavorare su foto e quanto connesso. Non troppo positiva invece l’esperienza con la camera frontale, che nonostante sia di 8Mp ha molte criticità. Foto non perfettamente a fuoco, immagini chiare e ogni tanto anche qualche chiusura improvvisa (ma questo dipende dal sistema operativo).C’è anche una modalità macro da 2Mp f-2.6 su cui però devo dire che ci sono una serie di criticità. Detto questo, il fatto che comunque ci sia è comunque un plus per la fascia di prezzo dello smartphone. In condizioni di luce estrema il risultato sarà anche discreto, di sera praticamente pessimo (o comunque senza una adeguata illuminazione esterna).🌈\xa0SCHERMO 🌈I 6,5 pollici sono comunque un buon taglio, molto comune veramente sopratutto se parliamo di Note (anche delle altre marche). Non compre la totalità dello schermo, ci sono infatti i classici bordi neri lungo tutto il perimetro. Nella parte bassa e in quella alta sono maggiormente evidente. Niente comunque di insostenibile da sopportare a mio avviso.Lo schermo ha una risoluzione 720*1600 HD+ quindi diciamo che anche qui si evidenziano alcune criticità soprattutto nei colori. Non troppo alta la luminosità, che in condizione di estrema luce (sotto il sole, al mare ad esempio) inizia a dare qualche problemuccio. Non vi aspettate nulla, ma comunque potete fruire di contenuti video abbastanza tranquillamente, ma senza troppe pretese.Il touch risponde, ma se iniziare a metterlo in difficoltà, comunque crascia o si blocca. In condizioni ‘tranquille’ il touch risponde bene, ma messo in difficoltà allora vi farà patire. Situazione che comunque dipende dal SO e che viene influenzata anche dalla quantità di memoria che si occupa in quel momento.\U0001faab BATTERIA \U0001faabAspetto tra i piu positivi della recensione è indubbiamente la batteria. Un 4400mAh che vi farà arrivare a fine giornata senza troppi problemi. Chiaramente molto dipende sempre da come si usa lo smartphone (quindi non aspettatevi tre giorni di carica se guardate 15 ore di video al giorno), ma in linea di massima - con un utilizzo normale, tra social, musica, chat e video - la giornata la copre bene.Con la luminosità automatica, riesce a fare un bel risparmio di carburante, così come la chiusura delle App attive. Con un po’ di accortezza questa batteria vi sorprenderà (sempre parlando di un prodotto di fascia bassa). Si può caricare tramite un classico USB-C, e quindi sia a casa che in movimento con un powerbank. Non ci sono altri tipi di carica intelligente (peccato).ALTRI ASPETTI E CONCLUSIONI ➡️\xa0A tutto questo aggiungo che all’interno della confezione c’è anche una cover in plastica, nulla di fantastico ma è comunque un plus e non dovete impazzire cercando una cover che si adatti a questo smartphone, che diciamo non è proprio comunissimo e nemmeno si trova facilmente in commercio. Non c’è invece una pellicola protettiva per lo schermo.Nella confezione troviamo anche il suo cavo e relativo caricatore. La confezione non è per nulla male, così come in generale il suo packaging.Ma per chi è pensato questo smartphone? Secondo me è principalmente adatto a due fasce d’età: agli anziani e ai giovanissimi. Sono chiaramente persone ‘poco esperte’ e quindi uno smartphone come questo può essere una buona soluzione entry level, per iniziare a spendere poco ed avere comunque una buona qualità complessiva.Ci sono tutte le funzioni principali, anche lo schermo è abbondante, quindi non è mal pensato per un pubblico anziano che richiede uno schermo capacitivo o per i piccoli che usano il cellulare magari per guardare i cartoni o video in genere. Appunto anche può essere un telefono da lasciare ai figli magari per la scuola, un primo approccio agli smartphone.Sembra anche abbastanza resistenti agli urti, oltre che ai liquidi, aspetti quindi interessanti per chi cerca un telefono resistente ma senza troppe pretese. Sta a circa 160 euro su Amazon, devo dire un prezzo molto buono per quel che è il prodotto, che non mi ha deluso per niente in relazione alla sua fascia di appartenenza ‘bassa’.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Roberto Buonanno (Keledan)', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 13 July 2023', 'Review Body': 'Mi è piaciuto subito il design.

Like it doesn’t even load just then crashes so I have to get the page up again and try to login again. And it’s not just websites, go to update chrome and the same thing it will freeze and crashes and you have to do it again so basically doing everything twice with this phone. Now maybe this phone is just warning up and might improve after updates and if so I’ll change review I’m also going to add videos of this phone in action just to show how bad it is. But the main thing I got this phone for him for is just to make and receive calls not too much to ask but alas the sound on voice calls is very poor low at the highest volume and actually sounds like if you could increase the volume it would only make it distorted. Hard to believe the other positive reviews for this watch phone are genuine tbh it’s hard to find any redeeming qualities.

Regardless if you receive a text from AT&T saying this phone does not work on their network, it is incorrect. I have no clue about Verizon and T-Mobile networks. But I would assume it probably works? Don\'t even worry about the description saying this is a GSM only phone if you live in the USA. GSM/CDMA is mostly long gone. Expect to only be using 4G LTE in the USA anyways.So if you purchase this phone inside the USA and use it on AT&T with an AT&T SIM, you will notice that everything works except for calling. This is because the phone defaults to having VoLTE disabled. AT&T is a VoLTE calling only network. So enable VoLTE in Settings > Connections > VoLTE (check photos).Aside from the cellular fiasco, the phone is a great digital detox phone. This phone has an internet browser but it is very limited. Expect days of battery life with receiving texts and calls. The phone allows for a decent amount of customization. I strongly suggest to watch several videos on this phone if you want to get the most out of it. This phone comes with some extra games which I wasn\'t able to figure out how to uninstall them. But other than that, there was no bloatware.This is a good cheap phone that I have been able to get working in the USA for AT&T. HOWEVER, This phone only is able to utilize LTE bands 2 and 5 (about 50% of the network\'s available bands by coverage) for the AT&T network. I have not noticed any significant cellular performance problems even while driving long distances, but I cannot guarantee the same for you. This phone does not have any other radios besides its 2G-4G cellular radio. So no Bluetooth. I don\'t believe you can play music off of it except for the built-in FM radio receiver. It pairs well with the SanDisk Clip Jam MP3 player.I like it. For $50, I am satisfied. Just note the vertical viewing angles on the display suck (check image). However the horizontal viewing angles are good.UPDATE #1: I began having issues with VoLTE calling on AT&T. When I called certain people, the VoLTE call would not pass any voice. The call would ring and initialize when the person (or I) answered, but then it would hang and drop after 10 seconds of no voice. I fixed this issue by using a T-Mobile sim card (through Tello, great deals for low data rate plans). T-Mobile, so far has fixed all of the calling issues. T-Mobile even allows VoLTE on 4G as well. I have been able to use this phone with 2G on T-Mobile, but it seems like 2G support is ending in April 2024.Also, adding custom ringtones can be done. To do so, make sure the music file is in .WAV format and place it in the ""Audio"" folder when your phone connects to your PC. The phone also supports MIDI files if you so desire.Aside from this, I have encountered some bugs in the S30+ firmware. Such as: the screen staying on long past the screen sleep timer, the phone deregistering from the cell network and downgrading to 2G while strong connectivity (it reconnects after 30 seconds to 1 minute or so). These are minor bugs and do not happen often. But I still like the device. So far, I have not discovered how to (if possible) to update the firmware if Nokia even releases updates to these devices (which they should).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'وجدي حسين', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on 6 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'صغير جدا وخفيف\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Andy', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 22 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Just got my order 100% genuine product .\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Christine maloney', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 26 October 2022', 'Review Body': 'Pour le prix son et construction bon.

It looks lovely and compared to the blue that my mum has, I think it is much better! If you dont really want a case not to worry, the red colour really stops the fingerprints and you get hardly any on the back of the phone. It came with a clear case and a screen protector attached which is lovely, saved me ordering two other seperate accessories. Word of warning when removing the outer film that is ontop of the screen protector, when you pull it off the screen protector tries to come off with it so bear that in mind otherwise you end up with a bubbly screen protector! Charging is quite fast (nearly a couple hours to get to 100%) the charger plug does get quite hot when charging so keep an eye on that.

Applied Microsoft launcher as A60 didn't alpha-order apps.

Dual SIM, though if you want to use memory card then this uses up one SIM slot, find this odd as had phone that had separate slot for memory card.

Do I care? No. Will you? Depends on if you are obsessed with having the latest version of the OS as the latest on this is Android 10.As for performance, I got the snapdragon version of this phone and it easily runs Genshin Impact as long as you don't go too crazy with the graphics settings and it has run any other game that I've thrown at it perfectly including Minecraft, Nier Reincarnation, Honkai Impact and an open source osu! client (S Pen came in very handy here). Emulation of Nintendo Wii games via the dolphin emulator produced a playable result with only a few stutters here and there.As for the cameras, they are of a high enough quality for me as I don't use any of the 100x zoom lenses or 8K recording that newer flagships have. I don't really buy a phone for cameras as I only really use the camera in Snapchat.Battery life is a decent 7 hours of my typical screen on time (TikTok, a few light games, etc) meaning I can easily get through the entire day on a single charge. When gaming on it, the battery lasts and average of 3-4 running Genshin and around 5-6 hours in Nier. If you do find yourself low on power, a 15 watt fast charger is included meaning you can go from 20% to 50% in around 25-30 minutes.As for storage the 128GB isn't quite enough for me as Genshin uses over 30GB now but the phone also includes a Micro SD Card slot which means you can drop in a 512GB card and have more than enough space for everything you'd ever need on this phone.Lastly the unlock methods are fingerprints or iris scanning (similar to face id). I have both set up but have found the fingerprint scanner to be faster and more reliable.I've had my Note 9 for nearly a year now and it still serves me well to this day. I highly recommend this phone for anyone that is looking for a bargain as I was able to nab mine for only £250 and it still feels just as high quality and responsive as any other flagship from Samsung.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gadgetonomy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Refurbished product that looks brand new', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this as a second phone and for a bit of nostalgia as I owned this model in 2019.

Battery life is also surprisingly good for a 5yr old phone.This was a flagship phone when it was launched but it does show its age with the camera (still good though) and the rear mounted fingerprint reader. The screen is bright and vibrant but is a lot smaller than my behemoth Galaxy s24 Ultra! However it has the iris scanner which I love! It works really well. And the S-Pen is still a very useful feature for me.The only issue is that the security updates ended in 2023, so I would be extra careful about what apps you have on it.

What a mistake I did.Now my work is driving around west to north London area ( Heathrow->Luton->central London area, 12 hour shifts ) so I need good coverage.Straight from beginning signal started to play( no signal, no internet at random places)3 days later I brought it back for another ""new Note9"" . Same issue.  I was confused as at that time they were building 5g towers plus lockdown and that seller Was very persuasive telling me that it\'s a network issue. I even changed network ( to O2 ) to match up network strength  with my work phone . Unfortunately I cannot use mobile data in my work phone for private purposes so still not sure . Months have passed and even my friends and family started to call me on my work phone as I Was always out of reachExcept network issue ( which is main purpose of the phone anyway ) I loved this phone, as other reviews say all apps run smoothly, wi-fi ok etc.  ****  Finally now ( May 2021 ) I typed in Amazon ""Note9"" to find out that Amazon does refurbished phones with one year return policy ( obviously there is no need to wait whole year to find out if phone works well or not)What a relief! Back to youtube, what\'sapp, drone flying, audiobooks, trip/sightseeing recording, and even film making app ( kinemaster) all runs smooth and fast! Please be aware that I\'m not gaming fan and I don\'t play games so don\'t know that, but I travel a lot and video/photo is still so good you cannot guess if it Was taken by Samsung S21 or my Note9  fresh and fast Straight from the box ! Phone Was like newfor £275 what a good choice!Now theese high street sellers are already crying for customers as everyone buys on Amazon now ( I feel sorry for them) even though the one who sold me  my first Note9 does not buy phones over from walk-in people, only from retailers ( friend of mine tried to sell him his phone ) it is proof that companies like Samsung send them  second grade unsold phone with problems. Adding to that lots of people complaint about stylus pen and mine Was also faulty ( sensor faulty->""please put back stylus pen"" on dash all the time ) but I don\'t really use stylus so it\'s ok for me. This one ( form Amazon ) is working and looking like brand new in fact I\'m writing this review using it.So if you are like me ->not playing games, using phone for WhatsApp, youtube, audible, Facebook, workshift callendar, but don\'t want to spend £1000 or more for flagship go ahead and buy it in here! You always can send it back and get your money back.If I could find one issue I could say that battery life is slightly shorter than my high street shop Note9. but still not an issue as for what I do it lasts  all day no problem.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Zarathustra', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Flawless and awesome, for a good price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'I love galaxy notes.

This phone comes with a slim fit protective case for free. Once you put the case on, the first thing you will notice is how comfortable the phone feels in your hand. It is lightweight and easy to handle for hours at a time. It's a 5G phone with Dual Sim, which not a lot of phones in Canada have. While dual sim is not useful in 2024 compared to earlier days with the popularity of e-Sims, it is still a neat option to have when travelling.The phone handles and processes very quickly without any lag, thanks to its built-in 6G of RAM and running the latest Android 13. The internal storage is 128 GB, but the great thing is it allows expansion so I have ordered a 256 GB microSD to add it to the phone.  I tested the NFC payment option and it works as advertised.  The main camera is 50 MP and creates sharp images at high quality. Night vision camera mode worked well when I tested it, although I am not experienced in night vision camera work.Now, let me get to the best part - while the phone itself is ultra slim, it comes powered with a 5000 maH battery. Given the power of the battery, the phone enjoys a very long-lasting battery life which I have really appreciated running multiple apps open and videos. The phone also stays very cool throughout heavy usage, which is markedly different versus my experience with the Pixel 7 previously with heating issues.So overall, for the price paid, this budget phone delivers excellent value for a slim design, no overheating issues, and long battery life.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'clay young', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 16 June 2024', 'Review Body': ""First of all, set your expectations - it's a $200 unlocked phone, something that obviously isn't meant to top the charts in benchmarks or handle heavy 3D editing on the go.What's in the box: the phone, charger, USB-A to USB-C cable, and a clear protective bumper.The charger isn't anything to write home about, same with the cable, but the free bumper is pretty great.

Budget phone that appears to punch well above what you would expect for it\'s price point. The 6.7"" screen is clear and bright although legibility is slightly difficult in direct sunlight, although not enough to be illegible due to the large screen.Included is a case, charger (not always a given these days), SIM removal tool and a USB C cable. The case is of good quality and should be more than up to protecting the phone from scratches and the odd drop.The design of the phone is understated, with minimal bezels on the front with a teardrop for the camera. The back reminds me of an iPhone for better or worse, with a triangular camera arrangement. Speaking of the cameras they are good for the price but understandably fall short of the flagships, the zoom was particularly impressive given the lack of telephoto although the macro camera was of middling quality.Charging isn\'t especially fast, but is standard on budget phones. The 5000mAh battery easily keeps the phone going for a day or two depending how heavily you use it and the phone always felt nippy enough, although I never tried any demanding games. The fingerprint sensor also works as expected and is quick to unlock the phone.Overall I\'ve come away very impressed with this budget phone, it has everything you need including a big screen, good battery life, NFC, and decent cameras. You can get improvements in the screen, charging speed and cameras with mid range or flagship options but those often cost at least 4x times the price of the A15T so this is a right bargain at £139.99  (at the time of review, a £14 voucher was also available making this am even bigger deal).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tom', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Brilliant phone for the price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""Arrived in nice box with it's own phone case, UK charger and screen protection (on the phone). It's a good looking phone, good size and not too heavy.Sticker on back of phone was difficult to peal off and took some effort to remove the adhesive and I scuffed the screen protection in the effort to remove it.The phone uses 'DDU launcher' and has a few umidigi apps on the phone that are unverified by Google play store (umidigi app store, weather, security, browser, themes) and are unable to be uninstalled. These appear to be non-malicious after scanning. The 'security' one is quite helpful to optimise phone performance. Even so I restrict their access apart from the DDU launcher which needs permissions for the phone to work properly. Transferring from one phone to another is initially quick, but takes time to reorganise icons and logging back into apps, but this is an android issue in general.So after the initial getting used to a new phone I am very pleased. I was really disappointed with the G5 mecha smartphone and this is a huge improvement. For the price it's very quick to use, apps don't crash and so far there are very few bugs that I have come across. Screen quality seems really quite good, (consider maybe tweaking miravision settings to get a good colour). Games and videos look great and are quick to stream. Sound also seems quite good and so far no issues with call volume. The NFC is very quick and works really well. Same with the fingerprint biometrics and the hotkey function is really useful once setup. Cameras seem good, takes some getting used to. For the camera it takes time to remove the 'watermark' for each type of camera (pro, selfie, macro, wide angle ..etc) in settings tab. However, I'm so grateful to get the wide angle camera back. My partner has the A15 and loves it as well, it appears to have more storage but this seems quicker.One thing to be mindful with umidigi phones is they cannot easily be upgraded to major android releases (once on android 13 always on android 13) if this doesn't bother you, phones can easily last 2-5years. It's a brilliant phone and hopefully saves you some money.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sid', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Solid Budget Price Mobile', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nFor its price range, the Umidigi A15T is a reasonably priced smartphone with good performance.

With the MediaTek Helio G95 processor at its core, it can easily manage daily chores and engage in light gaming. Under ideal lighting conditions, the triple camera setup, which is powered by a 64MP primary sensor, produces respectable images; however, low-light performance could be improved. One notable feature is the 5000mAh battery, which offers exceptional longevity and can easily power through a full day of intensive use. Only downside is that it has no 5G.All things considered, the A15T is a solid option for people looking for a reasonably priced smartphone with a big screen and a long battery life.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'P L WIGGLESWORTH', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Umidigi  A15T - Photos and Video of screen and applications', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nThis Umidigi A15T NFC mobile 2024 4G is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers decent performance, a versatile camera system, and a long-lasting battery. looks and feels good , The 6.7"" screen looks crisp and clear, The 64mp camera takes very good photos.

This phone offers a lot for its price.First off, the performance is solid. It runs on Android 13 and the MediaTek Helio G95, making it smooth and fast. Whether I'm switching between apps or playing games, it handles everything without slowing down. Plus, it's energy-efficient, so the battery lasts longer. The memory is impressive, too. With 8GB of RAM (expandable to 16GB) and 128GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and files. There's also an option to add up to 1TB via a TF card, which is more than I'll ever need.The camera is another standout feature. It has a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro, and a 16MP front camera. The photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light, which is great for someone who loves taking pictures. The 6.7-inch screen is big and bright, perfect for watching videos and browsing. The resolution is sharp, and the colors are vivid, making everything look great.Battery life is excellent. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day, and the 18W fast charging is a bonus. I never have to worry about running out of power. Extras like NFC, a side fingerprint sensor, and face unlock are nice touches that make the phone easy to use.Overall, the UMIDIGI A15T is a great mid-range phone with solid performance, a good camera, and long battery life. It’s a fantastic value for anyone looking for an affordable, capable smartphone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Eric Matsuoka', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 30 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'Design: In addition to the usual power and volume buttons on the right side, there is a customizable hot key on the left side.  You can choose what action you would like for a long press or a double press.  Or, if you don\'t want to use the hot key, you can have it do nothing.  Convenient if you have a program or two that you ""always"" use.  The screen is nice and big, and has very little bezel.  Thankfully no curved glass at the edges so no mis-touches when trying to play games.  Has a decently large battery but is not heavy. While that indicates the use of a lot of plastic instead of metal in the frame, I actually prefer a lighter phone to a more-durable but much heavier phone.  Uses USB-C for charging, and there is a standard headphone port!!!Included extras: There is an attached screen protector and a decent protective case included in the box.  The case has small lips that protects the camera and screen when you lay the phone down.Camera:  Gobs of megapixels but whatever, the most important thing to me is that photos come out very well (to me, a casual user), from close-ups to low-light indoor shots to brightly-lit outdoor shots (sample photos attached).Performance:  With 8 GB of ram and a decent mid-range processor, I have not had any slowdowns, freezing, or stuttering as I play Royal Match and browse web pages.  You can use two compatible SIM cards, or one SIM card and one micro SD card to add storage space (but the 128 GB of built-in storage space is more than enough for me).  There is great LTE reception and speed.  Not 5G but then a 5G capable phone at this price point would probably have an inferior processor, less ram, and/or less storage space.  There is NFC that works properly, too.  Battery life was not good on the first charge but improved notably on the second.  Now, I get a full day with just over 40% left in the evening.Overall: Highly recommended as long as you don\'t need 5G coverage.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Roberto Matilla Augustinus', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 13 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es muy bonito, bien diseñado.

My 2013 Moto G is far better in every way. This Umidigi also did something it seems a lot of these newer cheap android phones are doing which is have a really twitchy GPS so in Google Maps it takes aaaggeeessss to find your location, it literally randomly shoots around the area you are at, sporadically. It is annoying and takes ages to get a firm lock on your. I use the GPS/Maps a lot so this was a big deal. Plus because of these stupid notches at the top of the screen its so hard to reach up with your thumb and drag down the notification bar, really how did they over look that? You have to reach all the way up to the corner not the middle, to the indent, then drag down from top corner towards the centre of the screen. VERY AWKWARD. I have to say that I gave up, listening to the speaker as it carved sores into my ears, then feeling the pain and discomfort of just holding the damn slippery, cold, heavy phone in ones hand. It put me off instantly. I am very disappointed. And I am shocked that phones have actually got worse! Or is it that peoples standards are lowering? It seems that £100 back in 2013 would get you as phone that is still superior to the budget phones costing LESS in 2020?!? So weird. Anyway the moto g locks onto my location in seconds even indoors and accurately, and the speaker sounds amazing, and its comfortable to hold, the call quality and everything is up to a certain standard. Sure I only have 8gb but thats all I need. This phone is like a pale immitation of a good phone.

It has enough ram to play first player games reasonably enough, not much memory but you can add an sd card, NFC is a good extra for a low cost phone. The battery is OK, but as I will be using it mainly as a wifi hotspot I'll just leave it plugged in all the time.So why only four stars? The main reason is for the price. You can buy a new doogee x97 pro on amazon for only seventy pounds. It has a full touch screen (no buttons), more ram, a better battery and also comes with NFC.

The second phone would not take a charge irrespective of the charger used, so I assumed the battery was U/S. I then laterally took the battery out and heated it on the radiator (wrapped in a towel) for 20 minutes and tried charging again - and this time the battery took a charge. Still not sure if the battery is U/S or charging circuit in the phone is intermittent, but I decided to keep the phone and cancel the return collection as this phone is also a back up phone. Point is that Amazon were excellent at dealing with this but the seller (so far) has not responded. The least they could do is respond and send a replacement battery so that I don't get caught out again!! I have therefor raised the rating from 2 stars to 3 stars for that reason; BUT I remain unsure as to when the phone or the battery may wrap up..Previous review below....Bought two of these phones, First one had quite bad scratch on screen and the second the phone failed to charge, 99% sure its the battery on the second phone is completely u/s - so much for 80% capacity. The other phone with scratch on the screen does take a charge but the battery drops from 100% to 90% in a few minutes without even making a call so I suspect that battery will wrap up soon also.

If only I'd known that Pixel phones made other Google smart products work correctly, I'd have bought one much sooner. Now my smart home is smart and I've started learning how to use my previously bought (but long since ignored) Google Assistant products.As for the phones features, it's just obvious it's a quality product straight out of the box! If feels great, everything just works, the camera is (again) on a another level and takes amazingly clear and vibrant pictures.I could go on, but I won't bore anyone any further.Two things I don't like, the fact there's no 3.5mm headphone socket, that really annoys me. Bluetooth is great, but a hardwired connection is still far superior in some circumstances. And, the battery hasn't the stamina that I'm used, as I'm used to a 5000mAh. Although, this was something I was aware of prior to purchase, and a compromise I made as I wanted the far more important features that the 6a did offer. Too be honest, and on using the Pixel 6a for a few days now, the battery lasts long enough for my needs and I am a heavy user. I just have to remember to charge it at night, which is something I did with my last phone, and I now have a power bank for those times I go out camping and away from mains power.In summary, the positive attributes far outweigh the minor niggles, and I'm going to struggle to not buy anything other than a Pixel phone in the future!Goodness, doesn't that now mean I'm a Pixel addict? 🤣\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rob', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing value for money.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2023', 'Review Body': ""For around £300 you get:-  a camera more than good enough for most use cases.

I ditched a phone with better specs and a 100+MP camera - because the software driving that phone\'s camera was dreadful. My wife\'s Pixel was our go-to camera even though my phone was ""superior"" on paper.At first, the Pixel seemed to get a bit hot and I was worried that would kill the battery life and feel uncomfortable, but another review said ""persevere"", after a few days the software works out how you use the phone. That reviewer was right, it never seems to get more than mildly warm now.

This is the first phone from which I\'ve printed unedited shots.The only possible drawback is that it has 128GB of storage. The great camera means I take more pictures and video than I used to! That said, I have a few games, loads of apps, all my media and an extensive music library on it and I still have 30GB free.I am not a fan of massive phones and this is a good size.

E\' una chiara scelta di Google che ha riservato gran parte della potenza di calcolo alla AI e i risultati sono tangibili. Non c\'è cosa che i Pixel non sappiano fare bene proprio grazie all\'Intelligenza Artificiale, dalle foto in notturna o con luce fievolissima (basta meno di una candela in una grande stanza) alle traduzioni istantanee da qualsiasi App all\'apprendimento delle abitudini del suo proprietario.Queste e altre cose ti fanno dire che se non provi non capisci, difficile da spiegare.Non sono un nerd né un fan, non sono schierato eppure questo telefono mi piace... mi piace moltissimo ma non mi sento di consigliarlo, vivere un\'esperienza Pixel deve essere una scelta individuale perchè si devono accettare alcune lacune (immaginarie) per il suo prezzo. Schermo a 60 Hz? E chi se ne è accorto... Fotocamera da soli 12 Mp? A me sembra che faccia foto che nessun 64 Mp fa... Processore non fulmineo? Mi ripaga con un funzionamento impeccabile ed è comunque veloce e reattivo. Forse il fading che Google ha applicato inganna la percezione di immediatezza che si riscontra in processori paragonabili.Ho sentito parlare dei mali che affliggevano i primi Pixel 6, appena ricevuto ho potuto aggiornarlo ad Android 13 e non ho riscontrato nessun problema, direi che è perfetto.Batteria: il primo giorno di utilizzo reale con 6 ore e mezza di schermo acceso ed un uso abbastanza intenso sono arrivato all\'1.30 di notte col 16% di carica residua ma sembra che potrebbe migliorare ulteriormente dopo aver appreso le mie abitudiniIn definitiva è un bel mattoncino di pura concretezza. Mi piace tantissimoLo consiglierei solo ad utenti consapevoli, a prezzo inferiore si trovano smartphone con schede tecniche piene di numeri e ad alcuni potrebbe far piacere questoAggiornamento:Consumo: dopo una settimana di utilizzo raggiungo ormai senza difficoltà le 10 ore di schermo acceso. Il mio non è mai un uso intenso ma 10 ore di schermo acceso sono pur sempre 10 ore.In una giornata stress (uso davvero intenso e continuativo) sono comunque arrivato a sera col 7% di carica residua. Pur non essendo un battery phone la giornata la si copre senza patemi.Purtroppo confermo la pecca della ricarica lenta, molto lenta. Un Pit-Stop al volo durante la giornata è pressochè inutile...Esperienza d\'uso: non voglio usare scortesie verso utenti di altri brand, mi limito a dire che man mano che impari a conoscere Pixel ti domandi perchè sul mercato esistano anche altri brand dato che non potranno mai offrire la stessa esperienza d\'uso.Traduttore: seppure il motore sia il Google Traslator (con i suoi limiti) si viene proiettati in una nuova esperienza d\'uso. Dopo pochi giorni di utilizzo diventa normale guardare un video in qualsiasi lingua su youtube e comprenderlo in italiano. Come fai poi a tornare ad altri brand?Anche le telefonate trascritte e tradotte in tempo reale sono efficacissime. La conversazione non potrà essere molto fluida perchè devi avere il tempo di leggere e ""ricostruire"" mentalmente una forma semantica accettabile e la stessa cosa dovrà fare l\'interlocutore (a patto che abbia anche lui un Pixel) ma è un gran salto in avanti.Foto: solo 12 Mpx? Ma di che parliamo..... Le foto reggono il confronto con gli iPhone, senza se e senza ma... Inutile ogni altra disquisizioneLo ricomprerei? E\' il primo Pixel che provo e mi domando perchè Google non dia visibilità ai suoi prodotti, quasi non gli importasse di venderli. Un Pixel è semplicemente il massimo che un Android può offrire, che senso hanno gli altri brand?Aggiornamento e Precisazione sulla batteria: Parlavo (come da screen shot allegato) di 10 ore di schermo acceso. E\' vero ma va precisato che la misurazione fa riferimento all\'utilizzo nelle ultime 24 ore e non da ultima ricarica completa. Mi sfugge la differenza giacchè resta il fatto che 10 ore di schermo sono state comunque fatte con una sola ricarica, poco importa se al momento della misurazione la batteria era di nuovo al 100%.  Avessi eseguito la misurazione la sera prima a mezzanotte sarebbero state sempre 10 ore ma con batteria scarica. La precisazione va fatta per correttezza ma mi sfugge il motivo per cui alcune recensioni parlano di 4-6 ore di schermo acceso.\nRead more'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

It is designed to be used by elderly or senior people who prefer a simple phone without all the confusion smartphones can create. It also comes with a charging dock, into which you simply slot the phone to recharge which means fewer messy cables cluttering up your desk area.In addition it has 8 speed dial settings, a large torch button front and centre, an easy to use operation system, large icons on the menu, large fonts which are easy to read, high volume and high-definition loudspeakers on the back, built-in audio, video, Bluetooth 5.0 , External FM audio, calculator, alarm clock, calendar, and it can store up to 500 phone book entries.To set up, the 1000mAh large capacity battery and SIM card must first be inserted. The screen displays the time and notifications in a large easy-to-read font. The side has the volume up/down buttons and a torch button.This Uleway phone features two SIM card slots, so you can use it for personal AND work calls without the need for two phones.The battery lasts a long time. Its talk time is between 8-10 hours and standby time of around 160 hours (7 days). Even when making calls, sending texts, playing radio, and shining a torch.

The mobile phone measures 12cm in length, 5cm wide and 1cm deep. The mobile phone comes with a USB charging lead, a plug to charge it with and an easy to follow instruction manual.I would say that this phone is ideal for an elderly person due to the size of the buttons and each button is clearly labelled so you can easily press and see them. However, the screen on the phone is tiny, to me it looks smaller that pictured in the product image. The overall size of the screen is around 3.5cm length and 2.8cm wide. The text does look big on the screen however some people with struggle to see it on such a small screen.This mobile phone is dual sim and will only take nano sized sim card, there is also the option to expand the phones memory by adding micro-SD card inside the phone. This phone has all the basic applications you would normal get with a phone such as the calendar, alarm, torch, video recording and camera. The phone also has Bluetooth and 4G internet connection. The speaker is built into the back of the phone and isn’t the best sounding quality. This mobile phone also comes with a headphone socket if you want to listen to the radio however no earphones are included with the phone.Overall, this mobile phone is very straight forward to use and ideal if you just want a phone to make calls and text with. The phone feels very cheap and the buttons are very clunky to use. I don’t feel that this mobile phone offers great value as you need to buy additional micro-SD for memory however the camera not great so probably won’t need the additional storage if not using as camera phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'SUE B.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Cracking little basic phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Great as a spare or a phone for children and seniors.Takes me back about 25 years to when phones were smaller, lighter and basic - that in itself is a bonus!Charger supplied is 3-pin electric plug (micro fitment), but works with modern day micro USB leads too.Dual sim and memory card slots,  you need to unlock and hinge open the sim holder (3rd photo).Battery life on standby seems good.4G works - call quality a little tinny compared to a smartphone but that's to be expected.FM radio good, auto tuned and worked straight away.

But I've just got bored.Ive been looking for along time at what I could find that's new and decided it would be the find x3 neo or the OnePlus 9. (OnePlus is basically oppo anyway) I'm so glad I went with this one and I'll explain why.Build Quality:build quality it great, I love the colour, I went with galactic silver and it's beautiful, I love how it changes colour depending on how the light reflects off it. It has a nice matted glass back that doesnt show fingerprints (none at all) although this does make it feel a little bit like plastic but it's better than being smudgy and ugly all the time! The phone does have a bit of weight to it but also surprisingly light for the size, but it's enough to feel premium, the craftsmenship being up there with Samsung!Display:The screen is one of the best, covered with gorilla glass 5 and a nice screen protector out the box, it has a slight curve on the edges but doesn't seem to cause any issues with accidental touches, the 90hz refresh rate is nice, obviously not up there with the 120hz powerhouses but it's definitely a win over iPhones 60hz... The colours are amazing and is a truly great panel! HDR10+  also supported.Camera:Exceptional actually, it really is a great camera, there's 4 built in but I'm not really sure what part they all play as I focus more on the standard modes, with portrait mode also being a great go to that works probably just as well as Samsung and apples offering.. not up there with pixel but it's not far off, good dynamic range, white balance and focus, everything's good and I'm really surprised by how much it impressed me!Software:This is what sold it for me, I mean it's android so.. well... It's android! and I know what to expect, but it's the other bits, the color os and oppo bits that made it for me, it's fun and different ( a good change) how long it'll last on me I don't know, but I am loving the experience! It's clean and modern, little animations here and there and features everywhere! You can also personalise it as much as you like.. now when you first set it up the standard home screen mode is a little annoying and doesn't have the app draw but after navigating round the settings I was able to change it! Talking of the settings app, this is probably my only complaint, things are difficult to find in here and navigating is a pain to say the least, nothing is where you expect it to be and it's all a bit confusing, I just stick to typing what I want into the search and let it present itself to me! It's annoying but not a turn off.So to summerise a few pros and consPros-- build quality- camera- screen- software-its differentCons-- No wireless charging- the odd stutter when doing some tasks- last year's processor- no waterproofing or dust resistance ratingOverall I'm really happy with this phone, and just thought I'd share these points with anyone thats maybe not sure on their next phone, it shouldn't disappoint!I think I might be a new oppo fan\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'J.

It seems very quick and without hesitation in everything it does.With 256GB of memory, there\'s plenty to spare even when I load up with a lot of music to play in the car.I have the silver version - which is stylish and IMHO, looks good! Overall, everything seems to be well made and sturdy. The mobile has a reasonable weight and feels good in the hand.The display and the cameras are brilliant.  Charging is amazingly rapid and the device comes with a silicon case and a ready fitted film type screen protector.The Android 11 implementation is reasonably ""vanilla"" without an overload of bloatware. What there is, can mostly be easily disabled if necessary.I used the OPPO cloning app on my old Xiaomi and remarkably all my settings, data, media files and apps transferred over rather painlessly. I\'ve not had that before! I presume life was made easier by both mobiles being on Android 11.Just one app failed to transfer - and I simply reloaded it from Google Play. I then deleted some of the Xiaomi bloatware that managed to make it across.I did have to manually set up the Home Screen in my preferred ""drawer"" mode. I also added ""File Manager +"" as it also provides seamless local network access to our home NAS/Media Server. So, I can download music and films, and upload photos etc.I have had no issues with WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth. 5G gives some amazing data transfer rates. Battery life is usually more than sufficient for me for a day.So, overall I am most chuffed! The mobile is a joy to use with performance at a par with many flagship devices. The Amazon option of 12 monthly payments make it a viable alternative to a long term agreement - with the flexibility and savings of a ""SIM Only"" contract.However, this is not a cheap device and there are a couple of small gripes:- No glass screen protectors work on this device as keyboard and fingerprint sensor sensitivity are lost rendering the mobile unusable. So, unlike me, don\'t remove the factory fitted film screen protector! I have had to replace it with a soft \'hydrogel\' one...- It appears to be impossible to lose the Google app from the home screen tabs (RH swipe). I managed to get rid of it on my Xiaomi but OPPO seem to have blocked that option. You can disable ""Discovery"" (that chews data in the background) but Google Search annoyingly remains.....- The mobile is dust rather than water-proof.- There is only a small choice of cases available - particularly wallet/flip types.Wireless charging would have been great but the rapid charge capability does compensate.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lesley M', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Australia on 13 February 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is my second Oppo and I'm very happy with my choice.

I have sent and received texts on it and made and received calls and it works great. It comes with a cover and lanyard which is a great idea to wear it around the neck. Everyone I have showed the phone too also love it and can’t believe it’s real. I have put a sim in it but you don’t have too you can just use with Bluetooth from your normal mobile phone. I am going to use it as a backup phone to take on holiday or concerts or adventure activities when I don’t want to take out my iPhone as it’s inconvenient. I am also going to use it with my mobile phone when it’s in my bag etc so I can wear it around my neck and never miss a call or text. It also has a fun feature where you can change your voice to sound like Optimus as one example.

I've inserted a nano SIM card just to try, in which it slots in and clicks into place easily enough then it's a case of pressing to release.I love everything about this tiny phone.No it will not replace my smart phone but as an added little quirk to my phone it's great maybe even leaving the big phone at home and using for a night out with the sim card for my small bag.This phone even comes with a little silicon case and a lanyard lol.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Pedro Ruiz', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 29 December 2019', 'Review Body': 'Estoy muy contento con el producto ya que  lo eso como  segunda opción donde no puedo usar mi móvil grande es muy pequeño y  práctico  .también estoy muy contento con el  tiempo de  entrega ya que  se me fue entregado varios días antes de la fecha de  entrega gracias.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Erwin', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 29 August 2019', 'Review Body': 'Entsprechend seine grösse ist das ein sehr guter Telefon.

He had an old 2G phone but wanted to be able to send Whatsapp messages, something he could not do with his old phone. He is able to send short emails using my laptop and has sent Whatsapp messages using my phone and now wants to get a 4G phone. I thought the Doro 7030 would be suitable with bigger buttons and the fact that It came pre-installed with Whatsapp and was internet enabled was good. He particularly wanted to send Whatsapp messages to family and friends. The phone arrived very quickly and he was happy with the look of the phone, he liked the fact that it was a flip phone that fits easily in his hand. I read that this phone is quite easy to set up, this was not the case, it took me ages. I suppose when you are used to touch screen phones, using this type of phone can be quite tedious. Having to press each button and having to OK every action that is taken, was quite annoying. My husband was not too bothered by this so much, his main problem with this phone was having to scroll up just to read a line of text messages at a time, not being able to clearly see the whole message to read. No matter what we tried, we couldn’t access the messages clearly. He would say, with his old phone he was always able to see messages clearly. He looked forward to using Whatsapp but that was simply awful, he was not able to use it as the print was so small with the tiniest arrow to move around, you would need a magnifying glass to use Whatsapp. He became very disappointed with the phone and in the end, wasn’t interested in using it at all. I felt awful because I had suggested buying it and really thought the Doro 7030 would be the most suitable phone for him. I have now decided to return the phone because my husband has no interest in using it. I will have to get him a touch screen phone that doesn’t cost the earth.

The call quality over a 4G network is just as good as a top end smartphone as it works with networks that allow the use of HD Voice codecs.Now the not so good parts - Firstly for a tech-phobic elderly person , you\'re going to have to help them set it up. The menus and set up process can be a bit tricky to start with. Similarly it takes some getting used to the format to add numbers to the phonebook or use the SIM tool kit.The camera is, as you\'d probably expect at this price point, absolutely terrible. It\'s good enough for an ""emergency photo"" of, say, an item in a shop to send to someone, but you\'re not going to be taking family portraits with this. Similarly, the screen - while very clear and capable for text, really isn\'t for viewing snaps on. There is a media player, which is very good but the video player... well... lets just say 405 line TV was double the resolution - but, it /does/ actually play videos kindof!The battery lasts about 5-6 days here in a 4G strong signal area so ideal for my mother who forgets to charge things, and there is a headphone socket to listen to music and it has a radio built in that can play over the speaker or the headphones.Overall a great little phone for being a phone, and perhaps a useful music player, just don\'t expect it to be a iPhone or Pixel!

Bad decision all round! I suppose its familiarity breeds contempt, but the build quality of the old 2007 Nokia is superb, positive keys to press, looks and is solid (been dropped plenty of times). Large memory specifically for Calendar items  which was great for my usage.Compared with the 2024 Nokia 110 the shell is cheap plastic, wouldn't like to drop it onto anything hard, the keys are just not positive, on some you can, without trying receive the wrong info which is very frustrating. The memory on the calendar is miniscule, the camera is rubbish (why bother?)  it was advertised as  'with 4G' but has no internet connectivity (why bother?)2 Sims, it will work fine with 1 and the other ignored, quite fiddly to fit though.For the Camera you will need a (max) 32g Micro SD card, even more fiddly to fit and remove, but why bother when the camera unit is so bad. The ear speaker was also poor in my opinion.On a small positive the battery life is good.So, I gave it a run of nearly 3 months, got fed up with it and went back to the old 2007  modelOther people may love this small pocket mobile phone but it is very much not for me.Caveat emptor.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Vane', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 6 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'El teléfono está muy bien , es bonito, pequeño, fácil de usar sobre todo si has tenido otros Nokia, y digo ésto porque está en Inglés y no tiene opción de poner Español....el teléfono es para mi padre porque su antigua Nokia era 2g y donde vive ya le funcionaba mal, las llamadas no le llegaban y depende donde estaba podía hacerlas o no.Mi padre no sabe inglés pero como siempre ha usado ésta marca ,se está apañando bien, le gusta y no le resulta difícil hacer lo básico...Me ha parecido muy barato y ésta marca siempre le ha durado mucho aunque parece mas plásticoso que el otro que compró hace años...asi que buen dispositivo pero no hay idioma español\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fredo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 27 August 2023', 'Review Body': ""J'ai acheté de téléphone afin que mon fils puisse avoir un petit portable au collège afin de prévenir si besoin.Il dispose juste du nécessaire appel, SMS et des petits jeux il est ravi et moi rassuré.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Philippe', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 7 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bonjour, c'est un bon téléphone mais, malgré les nombreuses langues disponibles, il n'y a pas de dictionnaire français pour les SMS (écriture prédictive), et pour moi c'est rédhibitoire (retour Amazon).Comme ce n'est précisé nulle par sur l'annonce du produit, voici le détail des langues :- Langues interface téléphone : anglais, hongrois, russe, allemand, roumain, bulgare, estonien, letton, lituanien, et polonais.- Dictionnaires pour écriture SMS prédictive : anglais, roumain, bulgare, estonien, letton, lituanien, et polonais.- 2 modes d'emploi : 1 en roumain, et l'autre en bulgare (aucun en anglais ni en français).Sinon le chargeur a une prise de courant modèle Royaume-Uni inutilisable en France.

This came up in a comparison of phones for the best phone under £100.It's flimsy and light, and when using the charger provided, it gets very, very hot, very, very quickly. It is annoying to use - it's ludicrously easy to hit the button at the bottom of the screen that returns you to the main landing screen, making anything you are trying to do incredibly tiresome. It's also ridiculously slow - pages take so long to load that it's a flashback to 90s Internet dial up days. Worst of all, it has very limited capacity - I needed to scan and upload my passport for a hotel check in, and it simply couldn't cope: repeated insufficient memory warnings. Websites frequently crash for the same reason.The battery drains very fast - it is unusable as a smart phone, so I've been using it as a hot spot so I can use the WiFi on my normal phone whilst travelling. The battery drains entirely within about four hours.

I would definitely recommend a case and screen protector but you need to be careful what screen protector you use because some screen protectors won't let you press the side of the phone, for example, the backspace.

And my old 2G PAYG phone was getting very slow even though I didn't use it for the internet.For a long time I was confounded by the choice of smartphones available - every time I found one that looked about right there was some issue with it. I found the Nokia CO2 though the Moneysavingexpert website which is very easy to use. The reviews were decent and the phone remarkably cheap for a new model. Amazon has an excellent returns policy so I took the leap into smartphonedom.As others have said it's tricky to get the back off, but you only have to do it once so it's not important. Of course it's not a phone it's a computer, so like a new PC it takes an hour to get its brains together, install updates and a plethora of apps, mostly unwanted, that you can amuse yourself trying to delete afterwards. You can swipe up and down and various things come and go but rarely what you want. On the odd occasion when I get a screenful of various detailed options I don't know what to choose. I'll spend some more time time trying to understand it tomorrow. I guess all smartphones are like this - and apparently this is a simple one. I might use the camera very occasionally but somehow I've disabled it and can't find my way back to the stage I did it.Day two - I've managed to delete or disable the apps I don't want, and generally configure the phone more as I want it. I got the camera going by choosing 'Use camera as a phone' - to which the obvious answer was 'no' because I want to use the phone as a camera not the other way round... I even found a torch function! As a newbie it's far from intuitive, but that's down probably down to Android not the phone itself. One deficiency with the CO2 is that you can't divide contacts into groups - everyone is in one big long list. Even my 2014 2G LG phone had groups, so this seems a strange omission. And one minor detail is that whilst the photo in the advert shows the Nokia logo in white, in reality they didn't bother with the white so it's just pressed in, which looks cheap.Useability aside, the phone is a good size (big enough but not too big) and the build quality seems good for the price. It's currently switched off in a cupboard which is where all mobile phones should be unless you're out!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nikunj v patel', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Battery', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'It’s not with inbuilt battery\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Seymour Sunshine', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""I'm not using this as a phone ...

I have all the music I need on an SD card and the only other function I need is access to my address book to update it for new participants.I had previously been using a Samsung Tab 4 but it is no longer supported so it wouldn\'t reinstall the apps I wanted. I didn\'t particularly want a new 7"" tablet. I was attracted to this for 4 reasons:1 - it\'s inexpensive,2 - it\'s NOT a Samsung and therefore doesn\'t have the clunky and infuriating Bixby installed3 - it\'s got a USB B socket the same as the other devices I use for the exercise classes4 - it\'s small but quite big enough for my purposesIt connects to my speaker through Bluetooth and works perfectly as an mp3 player.I have all my Google apps on the device and full access to everything I need to run my business; i\'e Gmail, Google Keep, Drive, address book, Google calendar etc. The brilliant thing about using Google is that all devices synchronise with each other. I can enter a new contact on this device and it will automatically synch with my Chromebook and any other devices on the same Google account.The Go edition of Android is fine for my specific purposes running this business ... but I wouldn\'t have it on a phone; it\'s too under-powered.I don\'t have a SIM card in it. It automatically connects to the wifi of all the halls that I work in so I have Internet access should I need it. I leave it in my exercise business-bag so there\'s no chance of confusing it with my phone!I\'m very happy to have this as a micro-tablet and it leaves my phone free to be used for everything else in life.************************************************I\'m a great fan of Nokia stuff. I used to be a Samsung fan, but this Bixby stuff drives me nuts! My current phone is a Nokia G11 which I am delighted with. I thought at first that I would miss the Samsung customisations, but I really don\'t. Quite the opposite; it\'s a breath of fresh air not having to stress about Samsung installing apps that I don\'t want, but they think I should have.All smart Nokia devices run either a full basic or Go edition version of Android free of bloatware and without customisations. That suits me absolutely fine. When the time comes to replace my ageing Samsung 10"" tablet, I\'ll go for a Nokia and make the transition complete. Yay!

My son uses my phone for whatsapp calls to his friends when playing on his playstation.  He's quite heavy handed (on his 4th controller) so thought this phone might solve a problem for me.First impressions, it's really nice.  The phone itself is rugged, has a nice protective case built in that looks like it could handle a decent knock without any trouble.  The screen is great, 6.5inch, nice and bright and clear, nothing to argue about there.  It's very responsive to use, not as fast as my phone (Samsung Fold 5) but not slow by any means, very nice.It can support 2 SIMS cards and a Micro SD card to improve the storage (some of the dual sim phones I've used before don't let you use the SD slot and a second SIM at the same time, this appears to have 3 slots on the hold for 2 SIMS and an SD card although I haven't tested that yet).It's IP68 waterproof which I had to google to check myself what that means.  In simple terms, the first number is the dust proof rating, 6 being the highest and the second number is the waterproof rating with 9 being the highest.  IP68 means its fully dust proof and waterproof with the exception of high pressure hot water (at least that's my understanding).  So, it should handle spillages and a quick dunk without any trouble at all.It comes with 2GB of memory but an option to increase this to 4GB total by using some of the storage as RAM (I believe that's how it works).  Mine was pre-configured as 2GB+1.5GB so 3.5GB in total.It's going to be a christmas present for my son, but I've had a couple of days playing around with it while he's in bed and I think he will be over the moon with it.So far, so good.  It's a nice phone, sturdy case, responsive enough when in use, expandable memory, dual sim and waterproof all for £110.  In all honesty, I can't find any faults with it at all, it's not going to beat my Fold 5 in terms of performance, but then again it's a fraction of the price!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Slossed_in_translation', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Sllooooooowwwwww phone but quick and attentive customer service to resolve issue.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""Thought this would be a good purchase going by reviews,Being able to boost storage up to 2TB was what won me over and desl offered on price.Be good for storing music for going away when there's no internet connection.The deal breaker.Hopeless with anything video related.All the apps YouTube,Instagram ,Facebook etc takes forever to play properly,(good few seconds lagging in slow motion ) you get what you pay for i spose.I paid around £100.Dissapointed as reviews seemed good.Update: was contacted by seller and given an updated phone free of charge great communication and customer service.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'danskkr', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Phone lags so much it's unusable"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2024', 'Review Body': ""It is rugged, and tough and water proof, but that's as far as the positives go.As a phone, it sucks.

The DOOGEE Smini is a Rugged Phone with Big Features!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'I’ve been using the DOOGEE Smini Rugged Phone for a couple of weeks now, and I’m really impressed with how much this compact device has to offer. It’s rugged, powerful, and packed with features that are typically found in larger smartphones.Perfect Size for PortabilityThe 4.5-inch QHD+ display is perfect for those who prefer smaller phones. It fits easily in my pocket and feels great in my hand, without compromising on screen clarity. Despite its small size, the display is vibrant and clear, making it enjoyable for browsing, watching videos, or using apps.Tough and DurableAs a rugged phone, the DOOGEE Smini is built to withstand tough conditions. It’s shockproof, dustproof, and water-resistant, which is exactly what I need for my outdoor activities. I’ve accidentally dropped it a few times, and it’s held up with no damage whatsoever—definitely built to last.Impressive PerformanceWith 15GB of RAM (including 8GB virtual RAM) and a Helio G99 Octa-Core processor, this phone is surprisingly fast for its size. Multitasking is smooth, and gaming performance is solid too. Plus, the 256GB storage is more than enough for all my apps, photos, and videos, and the ability to extend it to 2TB with a microSD card is a huge bonus!High-Quality CameraThe 50MP camera on this phone is fantastic! It captures clear, detailed photos even in low light, which is not something I expected from a rugged phone. The front camera is also great for video calls and selfies.Long-Lasting BatteryWhile the 3000mAh battery might seem small, I was surprised at how well it performs. The phone is optimized to be energy efficient, and I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to charge. For such a compact phone, it offers more than enough battery life.Modern FeaturesRunning on Android 13, the user interface is clean and fast. I love the additional features like Face ID, NFC for mobile payments, and GPS, which all work perfectly. The dual SIM capability is also really useful for keeping my work and personal numbers separate.Final ThoughtsOverall, the DOOGEE Smini Rugged Phone is a compact yet powerful device that doesn’t compromise on features. It’s perfect for anyone who needs a tough, reliable phone with great performance, storage, and camera quality. I highly recommend it, especially for outdoor enthusiasts or those looking for a smaller, rugged phone!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gordon Comstock', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""It's small!

The touch screen is frustratingly oversensitive near the bottom, but simultaneously frustratingly insensitive near the top, making it hard to interact with many apps. After a few weeks of use I'm pretty sure it's not just me failing to get used to it. I thought the unit itself might actually have been damaged near the top during manufacture or shipping, because the back of the case is supposed to be black but is actually iridescent blue in the top left corner, so I wondered if it might've been heat- or UV-damaged. But, I saw photos in another person's review that seem to indicate that this is standard.In general, the phone *looks* rugged but actually feels sort of brittle and fragile. The buttons in particular feel a bit loose in their casing. It's thick and heavy but still feels like I ought to put a case on it if I want to actually be safe to take into rough terrain.I *absolutely adore* that this phone is small enough to fit into my pocket, which is a rarity these days. However, the specific choice of dimensions is odd and decreases the usability of the phone. The screen is tall and thin, meaning that many apps don't display properly, or display smaller than they strictly need to, with empty space above or below their main displays. This means that a lot of screen space ends up wasted even though there isn't much of it. It would be much more convenient to use if it were the same overall size but just a little shorter and wider.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sean Brown', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Small convenient phone,bigger than mid 2000’s but 100 times more useful', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Appearance,feels extremly well put together,I don’t know what you have to do to wear the battery out but I haven’t managed it yet,speed,sound and screen are as good as my up to date pixel.

I know a lot of people have commented on the clicking, sprocket-type rotation of the swivel stand... while the sound is something to adjust to, possibly, this design feature has been a great and unexpected plus for my mom!!Since she does not have great dexterity or control, oftentimes her attempts to manipulate devices can be frustrating for he because they are either too tight for her to move, or too loose to allow for only minor adjustments. The way this product rotates/swivels (clicking/locking in ""per turn"" to the left or right) is wonderful for my mom. She can turn it exactly how she needs it without it overcompensating and spinning further than intended for each click.She does need assistance with raising or lowering the cradle, and sometimes with the tilt, but this would be the case with any device for her. Often, once the height and tilt are set, swivel is all that she needs to adjust anyhow. She mostly uses this for her iPad, but sometimes for her phone as well. This just provides such great balance and sturdiness, that it never tips on her. Also, the foam padding on the bottom prevents it from slipping away from her or scratching the table.Super quality, assembly, and finish; very smooth finish and function!

After a month or two of using it however, I have concluded that it's awful, with few redeeming features. What I wanted was a nice tough small phone that could be taken anywhere and that just worked; an otherwise normal Android phone, but for hiking or trips or travel, since most smartphones will break just by looking at a travel plan.This is still quite a brick of a phone that barely fits in most pockets or containers, and I can tolerate that design in that it is pretty bombproof, but it could be two-thirds the size and work effectively, and that's only the beginning of its problems.The OS software is just plain absymal.None of the functionality is normal for stock Android, and the custom UX is totally counter-intuitive. If you go looking for a setting to modify how Android behaves, like a normal user, this phone won't even have the setting. Not even in developer options. It is riddled with stupid sounds that can't be turned off.Nothing really explains why AGM felt the need to Fisher Price dumb down the user interface. There's no money to be saved in a budget phone by reducing the settings available. I'm not sure what target market this is aimed at, that will benefit from an OS that is made harder to navigate and harder to customise.The camera is pretty terrible as reviews did indicate (nearly all shots are grainy or blurry), but I didn't get it for taking pictures, and the overall responsiveness of the phone is slow, but it's a budget phone, this at least I can expect.Not really a travel phone, in my opinion.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'A H', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Basic phone but has all the necessary smartphone features', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'It does everythign you need it to, the operting system feel and works pretty well too and the device is exptremly durable which coems with som eextra bulk as you would expect.

I spoke to the excellent telephone support team who recommended to turn off the phone, remove the battery for 30 seconds then retry. This fixed the issue and the battery now charges to 100%.The rear camera is not great, but the front camera is fine for Skype and Whats app calls. I have downloaded a few extra apps which are good enough for my purpose. I don’t use this phone as a music repository or to take photos and store pictures, but that said, you can increase storage capacity with an SD card if you want to do this.I have found the phone great for calls, texting and video calls plus it syncs to my car with Android Car Play and Bluetooth giving me full access to voice commands for making and receiving calls and SMS messages. It also runs the Kia UVO app so i can send navigation info and monitor the car remotely.The screen is perfectly acceptable. I use the Android “invert colour” function and the contrast is very good. For viewing pictures the screen is a bit washed out and the viewing angle isn’t great.Battery life is around 2 days if I make about 6 calls a day and send some texts and the odd short skype video call, perfectly acceptable for my needs.This is not really a phone for people that “live on their phones” but for simple calling, texting, video calls and running the odd app I think it represents fantastic value for money.

I am a very experienced smartphone user (just adding that as a lot of reviews for phones on Amazon are often by very clueless people) and have had numerous Android phones, and I upgraded from a Samsung S7 Edge.It has a nice 6"" screen, but because of the small bezels it doesn\'t feel large in the hands or pocket at all. The cameras (colour and B&W) are really good, I am an experienced photographer with good cameras and lenses, and normally hate phone cameras, but this is the first phone I have owned where I will use it when out and about and not have to carry a camera with me all the time. The low light pictures are frankly amazing for a phone.Battery life is excellent, I can easily go a day on a charge, and it recharges to full in less than an hour using the supplied USB-C charger.It comes with minimal extra apps installed over standard Android. I can\'t speak much about the UI for the homescreen as I always use Nova Launcher, but the settings menus are well laid out and have a lot of useful features. Performance of the phone is very good, and the 6GB of RAM helps a lot.Phone comes with screen protector applied in the box, and also a transparent protection case.Downsides:This is the first USB-C device I have owned, and it has no headphone jack. It does have a USB-C to headphone jack dongle which does the job. It has a pair of earphones bundles in, but while the sound quality was pretty decent, they don\'t stay in my ears at all, they are very poorly shaped with no rubber cover to help them stay in. It has no MicroSD slot, but with 128GB of internal storage that isn\'t an issue for me.Overall it is a fantastic phone that performs like a flagship model but costs less than half the price. Is a real bargain IMO.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'S. Brown', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'My new, best gadget.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2018', 'Review Body': ""After buying a Huawei tablet (MediaPad M3 10 lit, 5*) and loving the build quality I decided to make my next phone Huawei. Decided on the Mate 10 Pro coz it had no notch and a 96hr battery rating on GSM Arena.What can I say? Awesome. Very good looks, solid build and it does have that great battery.The Emui skin is not too intrusive but I always put Nova Launcher on for my own customisation.It comes with a clear case, screen protector applied, fast charge brick and some USB-C earphones (and a 3.5mm to USB-C  for normal earphones you may want to use).The screen is great. The new 18:9 ratio that most phones seem to have means it's taller but narrower, easier on the pocket.It does have some strong power saving modes as default but you can soon sort out which ones to turn off. The battery life is really good. After a full, first charge, it took me 8hrs setting it up, with screen full brightness to run it down. Very impressive. After a few days with it being used normally, it easily gets through a day. Sometimes with 60% still left!The audio is another strong point. Using some hi res earphones I get some good, clear audio. I mostly use Spotify at very high quality. I did notice it doesn't like third party equalisers, preferring it's own, very customisable app. Using its own external speakers the phone uses a downward firing port for the lows while the earpiece handles the treble. However, switch to landscape mode, for video viewing and the two speakers then also split the audio to stereo too. Very good idea.The camera is very good, plenty of modes, though to be honest, I don't use it that often. A few stills, when out with friends etc but they look crystal clear.6gb of ram is more than enough to handle the four constant widgets I have on my home screen and still show no signs of lag.As this model has been superceded by the Mate 20 and P20 models, it's now over half the price it was a year ago. Also, although it's a year old, it still has Android 8 so still pretty much up to date, software wise.It's a great phone, that battery is phenomenal. Very happy with this purchase.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mr. J. E. Dagless', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Late 2017 Flagship for half price! Result!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2018', 'Review Body': 'Okay my LG G4 finally went bootloop after just over 3 years. So I needed a new phone. I\'m never that much of a mug to pay more than £400 for a phone if I have to so took a look at what was going on Amazon for £250 to £400. So we had the Nokia 8 which looked great and super cheap but no notification light. Google Pixel XL MK1...great again but comes out of update support right now so no point. The LG G6 was looking solid if a little dull but I fancied a change maybe. Then the Mate 10 Pro was up. Great looking camera, half the launch price and plenty of storage. The other thing was the 4000mAh battery. If I can\'t change them at least I\'ll get a phone with a bigger battery. Oh and it has a notification light.Sold!Okay the phone took nearly a week to arrive but hey. First niggle is the charging cable is 18"" too short. The phone itself is great. I made sure I left the screen protector on by peeling the removal tab off instead. Into the case it went. Power on and two updates went straight on which was a good start. I then put back my apps and installed MS Launcher as I didn\'t want to get involved with EMUI. MS Launcher gives me the most barebones launcher once its tweaked as I want it.I was able to remove/disable 80% of the pre-installed stuff. The only stuff I couldn\'t was the usual own brand contacts/mail/messaging type stuff. Not terrible I suppose.So speed it great, as is the screen. You can change the screen colour but it comes pretty settled out of the box. The camera seems great though I haven\'t done much yet. B&W photography does look gorgeous I have to say. I don\'t take selfies being a 47 year old bloke.I don\'t listen to music on my phone so the loss of headphone jack is not an issue nor is wireless charging.One feature I miss from the G4 is the split audio levels for ringtone and notifications. Also I have to say the notification light on the 10 pro is a bit pathetic. It\'s the tiniest LED. Womp Womp!Battery life is tough to call as I\'m still in the honeymoon period but it will do me fine I think.It\'s since dropped another £15 since I ordered it so even more or a bargain!Here\'s hoping it lasts me three years!Edit - As of Jan 8th, all going well, super well in fact. I got the Android Pie upgrade pushed to my phone about three days ago (about the 5th update I\'ve had since October so not bad). Very nice indeed.

The battery lasts at least 2 days with good amount of use. The screen is bright in the daylight, perhaps too bright in the evening. Will need to try those apps that can dim the screen further. Operation feels quick and responsive thanks to its 8G of RAM.The size of the phone is good for mid to large hand. Easy to grip it firmly, especially with the case (included) on. Though I doubt anyone can use this phone with one hand. The build quality feel good. With the case, i have no doubt it will survice a few drops.Two negative points are, 1. the screen is quite reflective so it's some times hard to read. 2. the headphone and speaker are not the best for call quality, so a bluetooth earphone is perhaps a better option.Overall, It's another great product from Umidigi.

The camera application has been improved, now it comes with the panorama, the A9 didn't include it.

The only reason it doesn't get the extra star, is it does not seem to have NFC technology to make contactless payments with relevant Apps. In fairness, I did not buy it with this need in mind, as it's really just my back-up phone. So far, the battery is lasting for ages between charges (around 4 days of normal use) and the speed of running Apps (albeit I am not using it for gaming or regular streaming) is reasonably fast. Use of the speaker phone volume seems a little lower than I would have liked, despite checking all settings. The phone is slim, but it is quite big compared to other phones I have used - a format that seems more popular these days: approx. 8cm x 17cm x 9cm (when including the additionally supplied clear, gel feel, protective body case).One thing I am getting used to, is the physical buttons for volume and power, are on the right hand side of the phone as you look at it. Although I am right-handed, I always hold my phone in my left hand and usually use my left thumb to work those controls - perhaps something that shows my age, that in the old days, you would leave your right hand free to write notes.

I just wanted something cheap and robust to keep in touch with him when he's out with friends. When I started to set it up the night before, it popped up something about restoring it...I thought it's supposed to be a new phone, why would it ask to restore...it was a quick message that disappeared as quickly as it popped up ...so I carried on setting it up. What I noticed was the battery was draining by the minute (from a full charge) I thought maybe it's just because it's going through the set up process it's using more power...anyway set up was simple, it felt very light and came with a clear case so thought it would be ok for him....he was absolutely delighted on his birthday opening it, almost in tears!As the days went on the one thing we both noticed was the battery, it could reach full charge in about 20mins! But it would run out in less than an hour. That's with no games etc, literally just whatsapp and texting. It could be sat on the sofa and you'd see the battery % tick down. Then WhatsApp started playing up, kicked him out saying it was an illegal version of the app we had...we downloaded it from the play store.. I thought it was maybe the sim card, which was also brand new and part of my own contract, so I contacted EE, they said it's not the number, it's the phone. The main reason I bought it was to keep in touch over WhatsApp, now he was blocked from that and after googling for days found there was no way to sort that. From day 1 he was also getting constant spam calls and texts, again I thought this was to do with the number (brand new SIM) literally as I was setting the phone up he got a call from California! But EE said with everything else it sounds like the phone is just dodgy because he shouldn't get spam as soon as the SIM was activated. So in the end we returned this phone for a full refund, hassle free to be fair and I bought him a Samsung!

After much looking around and reading reviews i came across Huawei. I love how this company produces a 'Light' version of most of their main models, fitting the budgets of most people i would think. I checked that all apps used on my IPhone 6S were available first. I received the phone the day after ordering. I had it fully set up and did a full contact bluetooth transfer between the phones within an hour. Almost a week in now and i'm over the moon with the phone. Lighter and slimmer than the apple with a bigger screen. Great definition. The camera is also fantastic. The images produced are more vivid and sharper than i thought they would be. Sometimes the autofocus needs a little longer with cross lighting but generally very good. It was definately a learning curve switching from ios to Android but i'm already settled in. I'm still on contract hence the Sim Free option with this phone. I won't be looking back again. I really am delighted with this phone. Battery life comparison is fab also. Leaving for work at 6 in the week and getting home about 6 the apple would have about 40% charge left with moderate use throughout the day. With the Huawei its closer to 65-69% with more use (new phone novelty and all that). Looking forward to the P10 perhaps next year. :-)\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Piotr', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great value for money.

Instead of buying a phone with a fancy brand that costs more I bought a phone from a company that's honest about the fact that it's from china. Best choice I've made, even opening the box it came in feels better.It comes in a nice black box with golden writing and the phone and all the accessories are packed nicely inside in separate boxes, it looks way better than a pile of accessories in a small box with the phone squeezed on the top.The phone itself is really quick, opens and closes apps at a touch of the screen. Handles multiple apps easily too. The screen is great, beautiful colours and offers a really good view angle. It's an android so it will only have a few different options in the menu compared to other brands running on android. It was a quick and easy job to find these differences and setup the phone to my liking.On the design side all I can say is that the phone looks really good, a really elegant, classic design. Just a good, ergonomic phone with buttons placed where they should be. Good thing is that it has a mini jack for the headphones unlike some phones now.Overall I'm very happy with the phone.

The phone is incredibly slow and constantly gets hung up, making it frustrating to use even for simple tasks. Despite being a relatively new device, it seems to struggle with basic functions like opening apps or browsing the web. The overall performance is incredibly laggy and unresponsive, which makes it difficult to use as a daily driver.I've tried all the usual fixes like clearing the cache and restarting the phone, but nothing seems to improve its performance. Even after uninstalling most of the apps, the phone still takes a long time to load and freezes up frequently.Overall, I would not recommend this phone to anyone looking for a reliable device.

The build quality is excellent with a pleasant weight in the hand, and despite the back being made of plastic it has a premium feel.The UI leaves something to be desired, but after installing a custom launcher (Nova launcher is a must for those who appreciate the feel of stock Android) I was pleased with the little quirks and niceties that MIUI has to offer. While not as feature heavy as the flagship Galaxy S7, you do get a lot for your money here.The camera is serviceable, and can produce very attractive shots for those who know how to navigate the innards of a phone camera. Low-light seems to be a bit of an issue, producing grainy images, but when the lighting is good this camera can hold up as above average. The front camera is fine, but I'm not one for selfies.On the bottom we have the speakers which I'd personally prefer to be front facing, but they are loud enough. And I use headphones more often than not, so it is not a huge issue.3GB of RAM is plenty, and never experienced slowdown on my time with it, but time will tell how this holds up. The Kirin 650 processor, whilst mid-range, is competent enough to allow me to do all the things I need without issue.The display, whilst not amazing, is good. It's a 1080p IPS display - while most flagships are 1440p at this stage, the reduced resolution helps with battery life and cost - the colours are accurate and images are sharp, so it is good enough. Obviously AMOLED is superior, but when balancing cost/benefit, Id say this is the right choice.With the mid-range processor, and large battery, you can expect about a day and a half or moderate to heavy usage with no problems - great for people who use their phone almost constantly.It operates on Android Marshmallow out of the box, but Android 7.0 Nougat is available to download right now. Hopefully we will receive the update to 7.1 and get all the nice battery optimisations that come with that.If you're in the market for a mid-range phone, and don't want to shell out for the more up to date models (such as the P10 lite, or the Honor 9) then you can't go wrong with the P9 lite.Build: 5/5 (Though I would have preferred USB-)Sound: 4/5Camera: 4/5Performance: 4/5Display: 4/5Software: 3/5 (without a custom launcher) or 4/5 (with a custom launcher)\nRead more""}]",,2 GHz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

It does not work like one and if you are expecting a feeling of ""Oh it\'s just like the old one!"" you will be disappointed. What you are getting though is a fresh and lite take on an old classic! If you are old enough to remember small mobile phones or you never had a smaller phone than 5inch, you will feel refreshed! It\'s small, slim, comfortable to hold and feels like something that belongs in your hand. I heard people say: looks like a you! Well... and? It\'s completely a class of its own. It\'s a good looking phone. The color is more orange than red, didn\'t see the others live so won\'t be able to say if blue is blue or yellow is yellow. I like the color - looks fresh and has this ""zing"" to it. Built quality is satisfying, let\'s not cheat ourselves - it\'s plastic:) but good plastic. Seems durable. Screen quality is acceptable, you will see things you need to see. It has a camera... and yeah, that\'s it about the camera^^ If you have large hands, the phone will get lost in them and you will have difficulties using the t9 style keyboard then again, if you buy it to answer phone calls or you have ""artist hands"" this will not be an issue.

Want to disconnect yourself from the basics of having a battery draining, time eating YouTube and Social Media machines that try to take over the world? Hell Yes!

Phone, battery, headphones and a charger. See? Basics. Oh... I do not know yet how long the battery holds because it did not die yet.

It is sim free but it will not work on 3 as that is a 3g network and this phone is 2g only. It is ideal if you just want a basic phone to make calls or send text messages and is ideal to use in the workplace rather than use your decent smartphone. The price I paid was the retail price but some of these are being sold at ridiculous prices and I personally would not pay it. I keep mine in the car as I don't always take my phone out with me. It does have an mp3 player built in which is a bonus. I have also purchased the orange version for my wife which she really likes. The bonus feature on these is they have a 2000 internal memory for the phone book with a call blocker built in for unwanted numbers. This is essential for my wife as she only uses hers for family members. If she does ring out, her number is blocked except for certain numbers in her phone book and she does not text. It is perfect for anybody who wants to keep their privacy. Overall it does what it is designed for and although it is a bit pricey, it is a lot cheaper than a decent smartphone and ideal in certain circumstances or as a main phone if you are not bothered about smartphones. There does appear to be a lot of fakes on here and even though I bought mine from Amazon direct, my wife's came from the Carphone Warehouse because I couldn't get the colour she wanted from Amazon itself, but Amazon was the cheapest and they are both genuine Nokia 3310 handsets.

The storage capacity is beyond what I need, so I devoted an extra 6GB of ROM to RAM. I'm not sure if that's a Umidigi specific feature or not, but it's very handy. The camera is not quite as spectacular as an iPhone, but for about an eighth of the price I'm not going to complain, and it's still better than any other phone camera I've had. The battery usually lasts me two days with normal use, and under heavy use (studying, gaming, and playing music for multiple hours) it's usually around 25% by nighttime. The processor has handled every game I've put up to it and it's never lagged or had any delay, no matter how many apps I have up.It can utilize VoLTE, NRLTE, and work as a hotspot if your mobile plan allows these. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a high quality phone for a fraction of the price of a comparable device. $200 isn't exactly pocket change or the cheapest phone available, but I think probably the best buy available dollar for dollar.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Shopper', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on 29 December 2023', 'Review Body': 'Got a boxing day deal.

Which is why I purchased another one. However, the advertisement says single sim uk version (model number CLT L09), which is not what I received. I received a dual sim International version (model number CLT L29). There are slight nuances between the 2, the screen at the bottom curves in the corners on the international which it does not on the UK version. The OS is slightly different and it will only upgrade to Emui 10, rather than the Emui 12 I currently use. This may not bother others, but it did me.  The phone did come new in box and sealed. However, the charger plug did have tiny dents in it around the top and the top plug insert was very wobbly. I wouldn't expect this for a brand new sealed phone.

First the good.Great hardware. Exceptional camera as you've probably seen in the reviews and the UI is easy to use. The screen itself is crisp and sharp - and at a nice high resolution. Phone is very responsive, and I find the memory capacity more than enough for my app needs. Battery often lasts a couple of days, and a supercharge can be done from near empty in under an hour. I like also how easy it is to link your phone to a screen, either via USB C at work or say a FireStick at home. The phone compass is a bit iffy, but generally good enough for navigation and bearings. The finger sensor is slightly fussy I've found in terms of matching the angle you registered a fingerprint at. Facial recognition works well, but as a security feature I would turn it off - it doesn't have the depth perception capability of the Apple phones.Now the downside. And it's a big one for me personally. Huawei's EMUI operating system is set to aggressively preserve battery life. This means that any non-core app gets put in to sleep mode after about 30 minutes of inactivity, and this includes WhatsApp. For me, and many others I bet, WhatsApp is their principal comms platform. If you don't log in to WA for about 30 minutes it stops polling for messages. Many a time I've checked in after a few hours and received a ton of messages in one go. I've changed all the possible settings (and there are a LOT that are hidden away) but none of these fix it. I've spoken to Huawei support and they advised wiping my phone, then suggested I contact WhatsApp for a fix!!  Look around, there are many other posts on this subject. If WA messenger is important to you, then I would not recommend this phone with EMUI 9, at least until they fix this key issue.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Allan W.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Awesome Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2019', 'Review Body': 'I love everything about this phone!Screen is so clear and sharp and unlike my old HTC phone I can see it outdoors in bright sunlight.

MacDonald', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Probably the perfect phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2021', 'Review Body': ""After using a Pixel 3a for some time, my phone provider offered me a good deal on an upgrade to a Samsung S20 FE. Despite the fact I had tried Samsungs years ago and hated them (due to the terrible OS and bloatware) I thought that things may have changed - I was wrong. The Samsung operating system adds unnecessary confusion and undermines a lot of the functions of stock Android replacing them with worse Samsung versions. It is a nightmare.When the buttons started falling off the Samsung (yes, really) I decided that enough was enough and bought my current Pixel 5 - and what a breath of fresh air it has been.This phone, despite being a similar price to the Samsung, is a much better built device. The main body has a lovely satin finish that is soft to the touch while remaining grippy and fingerprint-free. The buttons are solid and tactile, and the fingerprint sensor works every single time (a big improvement on Pixel 3a).Additionally, the size is just about perfect for me - not ridiculously oversized as seems to have become the fashion.Most importantly, the OS works exactly the way you want it to, with zero bloat. The phone is fast and has not frozen or stuttered on me once.The screen is also bright and looks good to my eyes. Battery life is more than sufficient, on par with the S20 FE certainly. I'm not a photographer by any means and have found the cameras to be great.If you ask me, this is the best phone on the market for non-silly money. Ignore whatever the 'pro' reviewers saw: Samsung quality and software still leave an awful lot to be desired.The Pixel 5 is a phone that is everything you want it to be: it feels good in the hand, and provides a slick and smooth user experience. For me that makes it the best phone phone you can buy, and relative to the cost of other top-end phones it's also excellent value for money.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'A', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Pixel 5 is a fantastic phone! Highly recommended!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2020', 'Review Body': 'The Pixel 5 is excellent. Anyone worried about the ""midrange"" 765G chip shouldn\'t be. The phone is as snappy and responsive as any other flagship phone. I\'ve always used flagships with the highest end Snapdragon 8xx chip and I genuinely don\'t notice a difference in performance with this phone. Perhaps if you had two phones side by side you could see the difference but in day to day use, you can\'t tell this phone is using a midrange processor. The Google software experience makes this the smoothest Android phone I\'ve ever used.Using a midrange chip and keeping the screen at 90hz does wonders for battery life. I\'m averaging 8 hours of screen on time and reaching the end of most days with 50%+ battery. I\'m quite amazed. This is a two day phone battery for me.Camera quality is excellent as you would expect from Pixel. The photos and contrasty, punchy, and sharp. I still think the Pixel takes the best looking photos. It\'s close and the competition is catching up but you can\'t beat this phone for photo quality consistency.The screen is good too. An OLED panel which in my eyes looks as good as any other flagship phone on the market. Gets really dim and brightness outside is okay too.I should mention that the haptics are also good. Slightly different to Pixel 3 and not as good as iPhone haptics but still a cut above other Android phones.There aren\'t many negatives with this phone. The speaker quality could be better but it\'s loud enough and perfectly usable for watching YouTube and listening to Spotify occasionally. Yes the lack of face unlock is technically a downgrade from Pixel 4 but when you\'re using a facemask or covering a fingerprint reader is far more consistent and also very quick! It\'s a shame but you also lose Active Edge (which I personally was a big fan of), but I guess that\'s not unexpected given the lower price.All in all, Pixel 5 checks all the boxes for a great phone. Stellar performance, great battery life, expectedly amazing camera, screen quality, price. Wireless charging and IP68 certification are nice to have too, unlike some phones (I\'m looking at you OnePlus Nord/8T). Pixel 5 shows that you don\'t need to pay £1000+ for a flagship phone. What you\'re paying for with those more expensive phones is a higher tier processor that makes no difference to day to day use, more cameras (two cameras is perfectly fine, quantity does not equal quality), potentially larger, higher resolution 120hz display. Are those worth the several hundred pound premium over phones like the Pixel 5?

No Bloat of Pre-installed apps.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2021', 'Review Body': 'UPDATE: September 2024, updated to ANDROID 14 - 3.18GB; ""OFF switch"" is now located at the bottom of the screen, next to the Settings wheel, NOT pressing & holding the ""ON"" button. No phone issues or problems. Nokia X10, 6.67"" & 5G Model. White rear cover & factory fitted Screen Protector(100% Compostible.) Sold and delivered by Amazon, undamaged, new, with box sealed, and 11 days early! *UPDATE: April2024. February & March security updates installed.  No quality, or performance issues. * March 2023: Latest OS(operating system) update, Android 13, included the addition of a ""Personal Safety"" app, which provides a short cut to contact Emergency Services, and a ""Car Crash Detector"" which will contact them for you. So it is no longer just iPhone devices that have this facility. Latest Security Patch installed, too. *Also, for those that criticise Nokia, I recently read on Reuters news that Huawei have announced that they will continue to licence technology from Nokia; an agreement which started in 2017. Nokia confirmed the arrangement. *I was also permitted to uninstall Google 1, which I have never used; the only Google apps I actively use are Gmail, and occasionally Chrome - which I regularly clean the cache & data usage from. *UPDATE: DECEMBER 2022. I recently UPDATED to ANDROID 13, using some of my SIM/monthly pre-payment GB quota; wi-fi was not necessary, and worked fast enough for me. Phone works well, with no issues or disappointments; also pleasing that very little amount of Cache to clean. *A replacement for my Android 11 updated Xiaomi Redmi 9 3/32GB(see my review.) My Xiaomi Note 9T(see my review) has stopped duplicate notifications, and has accepted I am not updating to Android 11. Having decided never to buy a 100% Chinese  smartphone again, due to privacy, and increasing permissions issues, and loss of functions; as well as owner and press reviews. This narrowed the choices considerably, but resistance was not futile! I wanted 5G back-up, again, due to my reading that 6G is well along in phone research and development, and planning. Also, Research found upper entry level 5G phones have a lower spec, in order to offer 5G, with the accusation that some are only 5G to boost sales, due to the huge investment in 5G networks. I came so close to buying Motorola, as, though owned by Lenovo, the brand reputation has not really suffered. Indeed, they have many happy owners, some on their third or fourth handset. But concerns over receiving even one update, ongoing over abundance of models, and the expert opinion that Motorola have never, since, matched the quality of the original 2013 Moto G, made me ""pass them by"". *Next Samsung had to be researched, though I resent paying a premium for the brand. Though soon to be overtaken by the dreaded Xiaomi, for sale of smartphone sets, Samsung had to be considered for upper entry level price, camera, & reviews. Struggling to find a 5G, with a good camera (not a right) and spec, the ""shock horror"" moment came when I stumbled across a former happy owner of one new Samsung model, who, with his first update, discovered his phone performance had been slowed, and camera quality reduced. (Didn\'t iPhone once try a similar strategy, to motivate owners to trade up? Didn\'t it end badly, for them?) Samsung seem to have gotten over their perception that some models were underpriced, and that owners took unfair advantage of them, as, surprisingly, the A53 5G has been professionally reviewed as over priced, and with lesser performance than the earlier A52s, and by design, such as moving from a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset to Samsung\'s own Exynos 1280 chipset = an overall downgrade. I cannot emphasize this enough, check professional technical, and owner, reviews; as well as provider ratings (Amazon UK Logistics were recently rated as number, by Which? magazine, as No 1 for punctuality reliability, and services) before sinking your money into what is an expensive purchase, even at upper entry level. *So my journey carried on, but not for long, when I found the mid-level Nokia X10 5G, at a very competitively Amazon Black Friday discounted price - compared to the release, and then, later, - reduced prices. Our 2016 Microsoft 640 XL still has better telephone call quality than the Xiaomi, ok battery, Zeiss camera, SMS messaging &  navigation working, although the rear speaker is now complaining at high volume, at age 6!. I was pleased to read the X10 specs, including Zeiss optics, and owner reviews for the X10. On top of that, a great price! I do not use Fingerprint, or Face, recognition security, so cannot comment on it, apart from not liking it - maybe because I have got used to not worrying about my 4 fingers and a thumb remaining on each hand!  X10 came with seemingly better quality factory fitted screen protector a soft 100% compostible separate ""oat meal effect"" surface eco rear protector; with black USB C cable. I think the build quality is solid, and it looks stylish.  TDM confirmed it accepts 18 watts fast charge, which is fine for me, as I a have an Amazon supplied MAGI-X-Charger, which has good owner reviews. Having recently read that smartphone batteries last longer if they are charged from 40% up to 80%, as required - avoiding going under 20%, and up to100% charge, I have adopted this method. Fully charging a battery takes longer, and did not lengthen the performance, or life, of 2 previous dead non-supplied by Amazon smartphones (including a 2018 ASUS ZENFONE 4 520 - died 3 months before end of warranty; supposedly new battery and OS didn\'t stop it dying a second time, 3 months after warranty expired.) So 40%-80% takes around 40 minutes with my 18watts charger, which is not inconvenient for me. As expected, for we are still using the Microsoft 640XL for national & international calls, the Telephone call quality of the X10, and Zeiss camera, is superior to the Android 10 only Redmi9T (will not update to Android 11; I am still refusing permissions to access all data, tracking, & monitoring, and, keeping the front camera covered with a cut to size sticker); and previous Redmi9 - both infuriating the Mrs, and her having to use mobile earbuds. The apps tray is accessible from sliding the screen upwards (not having to go to ""Settings"",  ""Apps"", then ""Manage Apps"") and has no Apps Bloating, so no need for me to delete 25+ pre-installed apps I deleted to free up more RAM on the Xiaomis! Easy to set up, by touching the ""Configuration"" message, then ""Install""!  Commence slide just above the bottom black bar, where you see ""Nokia"", to return to front screen. A Black Friday genuine Amazon bargain! Conclusion: a welcome return to Nokia for quality and specs; lack of ""Bloatware"", tracking, monitoring, data demanding permissions; or mischievous system updates, such as Location having to be switched on to use the camera (our Xiaomi Redmi 10 PRO, which lasted 10 months as a home based backup. - See my Review). This Nokia X10 high quality, and highly recommended!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Peter M', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Decent value for money midrange phone. Camera ""Zoom"" is not very good - at maximum zoom rubbish!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 May 2023', 'Review Body': 'It is a phone ;-) Yeah, it does stuff like Android Pay in my local supermarket. - The only bad feature is the stupid ""Assistant"" button on the left side. Given the balance of the phone in my hand, I kept nudging it by accident. The included ""half-case"" makes this even worse. I resorted to cutting a slot out of the left side of the ""half-case"". Much better now. - No charger in box - you get a ""half case"" made of some white rubbery stuff with what looks like wood chips in it. - Comes with a screen protector pre-installed. - Camera is all right for wideview shots, but rather limited past about 4x zoom. Either stand closer to the subject, or buy a proper small camera (we have a Panasonic pocket camera with a 20x optical zoom which will beat ANY smartphone hands down on stuff like moon photos and pictures of birds and aeroplanes in flight - BUT it is fatter and heavier than a smartphone, and you cannot talk to people with it!) - Battery life is modest if one leaves all the ""connections"" on (Location, wifi, phone signal, bluetooth, NFC) - but a LOT of modern phones are like that. In bright light, one needs to whack up the screen brightness, too ... which uses even more battery. It is just a trade off - power/features vs battery life vs size/thickness. My late 1990\'s Nokia would do about 1 day when new, and I bought a ""fat"" battery (that stuck out the back) to get 1 1/2 days. How times have changed! My Nokia X10 lasts longer than that. (Of course, if one is actively using it all day, battery life is a LOT shorter - that was true 25 years ago, and it is true now!)- Summary - nowhere near as good as the ""flagship"" models from Apple, Samsung, etc., BUT it costs a LOT less. A LOT less. You pays your money and takes your choice. The Nokia X10 6GB/64GB model suits me just fine (especially after I cut a small hole in the ""half-case"" to stop the ""Assistant"" activating so much!)Update: Now mid-September 2023.Yeah, it is generally very good.In the hot weather, it seemed to have problems with my sweaty fingers on the fingerprint reader.In the time I have had it, there were a couple of OS updates - I am now on Android 13.I cannot comment on the ""dual sim"" feature, because I have never tried to use it.The phone does come ""unlocked"", though, so the SIM from my previous phone went straight in and worked with no problems at all.I was torn between buying a ""mini-phone"" (phones with 4 inch screens fit in the pocket better!), and a ""full-size phone"" (which this NOKIA X10 certainly is).Hmm. I have quite big hands, and the screen on the Nokia X10 makes watching YouTube etc on it MUCH better than a ""mini-phone"". [I also have a sports watch, so I do not try to run with a huge phone strapped to my arm!]So all in all, I am very pleased with my Nokia X10 = it does the stuff I want it to.Paying in the supermarket, basic photos even in poor light, WhatsApp messages, actual phone calls, etc etc. And with plenty of RAM and plenty of storage space it should last me for a while.I am hoping for 5 years from the phone - less than 3 and I will be disappointed, more than 5 and I will e even more delighted.[A previous Sony Ericsson, an X8 from 2011 worked for about 11 years, although at the end the battery life was very short and current apps no longer worked - it had Android 2.1! But it still made calls and texts, and took basic photos - I used one for a car insurance claim, where ANY camera is better than no camera!The Nokia I bought in the 1990s lasted me 8 years, a 2110 I think, and I changed that for a cheaper contract rather than there being anything wrong with the phone!So this is my second Nokia: 8 years for the first.Yeah, I have high hopes for this NOKIA, too, even though it is unlikely it will match that Sony Ericsson!]\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Karolina D Wakulinska', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Nokia X10 is a cool phone!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2024', 'Review Body': ""I needed a phone and even though I'm not a fan of buying new ones, I thought I will treat myself with this Nokia.

It is perfect for browsing, watching movies and videos.3, Octa-core 1.6GHz processor ensures smooth operation, even when multitasking. It is fast, responsive and very pleasant to use.4, The large 5150mAh battery is a prominent selling point. It provides enough power to get through the day without constant charging.5, The phone has a sleek and modern design with a comfortable grip and an easy-to-use interface.6, Equipped with a 3.5mm separate headphone jack, which is very useful for me.Shortcomings:1, Camera quality could be improved. For an affordable phone, it has decent camera quality, but it falls short of the high-quality cameras found on more expensive models.3. the speaker quality of the phone is average, an upgrade would allow for a better audio experience.Overall, the OUKITEL C36 is a good value for money phone.

I part set it up and he completed it and added his apps.  He loves taking photos and the photos are really good.

The camera is TRUE to what it says 13MP all day long (unlike on my newest ""flagship"" phone - 48MP sounded good but only on one mode that isn\'t worth using). The video on the Nokia is good too. All easy to use.Battery life is great. I\'m impressed. USB-C connection too.The good thing too is my son added an app which means we can face chat when he\'s out and about - much better than carer\'s relaying through the dimphone. Adding and using apps is easy. There\'s provision to add extra SD storage.And now knowing what other android phone providers offer I personally will not bother with the the flagship brand next time.If you\'re tech savvy or out for the latest technology this probably won\'t be the phone for you.

I didn't notice any performance issues when it's working. It doesn't have the usual fingerprint recognition but I didn't miss that too much. Could be a dealbreaker if you need that though.In any even the real issue is the phone says the data is corrupt and needs a factory reset EVERY TIME it's turned off and on. Sadly this is often as it seems to get stuck on certain operations pretty frequently. This means you have no option but to do a factory reset and transfer files over again from your old phone.This seems to take longer each time.

I chose the Nokia G11 as I had very fond memories of my old Nokia from decades ago and the price was reasonable. I have to say that I wasn't expecting very much, after all how good could a phone that was a tenth the cost of an iPhone be?First impressions are important and with a phone the first impression is the packaging. The Nokia packaging was very like Apple's, reassuringly sturdy and glossy. The overall impression was that this was a luxury product at a budget price. Then there was the phone. I was expecting it to feel plasticy and cheap. What I found was a phone that was nicely weighty and felt extremely well built. The initial set up was easy but it did take a little time as it had to download two updates, each of over a gigabyte in size but once that was done everything was set up in a couple of minutes. The interface, which, again, I thought was going to be slow and sluggish, was smooth and responsive. The only negative is the resolution of the cameras and it could have more built-in memory (although you can use an SD card to expand the memory), apart from that this is a fantastic phone.

Showcasing a catalogue of awe-inspiring features, this phone doesn't just meet expectations—it surpasses them.The first thing that strikes you about the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is its blazing-fast performance. Multitasking and app usage are seamless experiences, reinforcing the device's superiority. Its multimedia capabilities don't disappoint either—with brilliant picture quality and immersive sound, it’s tailor-made for a top-tier media consumption experience.OnePlus's collaboration with the esteemed camera company, Hasselblad, has culminated in a unique Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. This partnership has accelerated innovation in mobile photography, featuring natural color calibration. The potent combination of a primary 48 MP camera, a 50 MP ultra-wide camera, a telephoto lens, and a monochrome camera guarantees breathtaking photos. This impressive camera suite shines even in challenging, low-light conditions.But the delights of the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G are not confined to photography. The smartphone features a 6.7-inch Smart 120Hz AMOLED display, enriched with LTPO technology, delivering a fluid and vivid viewing experience. Remarkably, the display achieves a 120Hz refresh rate while consuming up to 50% less power—an undeniable testament to its superior engineering.The innovative Warp Charge technology is another standout feature. Equipped with a 4500 mAh battery, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G exhibits astonishing charging speeds—jumping from 1% to 70% in a mere 30 minutes with Warp Charge 65T. Not to be outdone, the wireless charging capability is equally fast, promising a full day's worth of power in just 15 minutes.Under the hood, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform, delivering a 25% boost in overall performance over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 865. It operates on OxygenOS 11, known for its clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.However, perfection is elusive, and the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is not exempt from minor shortcomings. Users have reported occasional bugs and issues with the Oxygen OS, although these are likely to be addressed in forthcoming updates. The placement of the fingerprint sensor could also be optimized for greater accessibility.Pros:  • Extraordinary camera performance due to Hasselblad partnership.  • Fluid and vibrant display enabled by LTPO technology.  • Incredible charging speed, courtesy of Warp Charge 65T and wireless charging.  • High-octane performance powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform.  • Aesthetically pleasing design and excellent build quality.Cons:  • Potential bugs and issues with Oxygen OS.  • The fingerprint sensor's placement could be improved for easier access.In conclusion, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G represents the apex of smartphone technology, offering an extraordinary camera experience, unparalleled performance, and a breathtaking display. A few minor flaws aside, this phone is a compelling contender for anyone seeking a flagship device with state-of-the-art features. It delivers on its promises, making it a worthy addition to the top tier of the smartphone market.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone at a bargain price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Great phone and a bargain at £209 through Amazon on Prime day.

If you need a new phone get a pixel 6 or an S21 instead.Old review:Good things (coming from an s20 ultra)-Latest Snapdragon chip-The matte finish on the back is better than shiny glass.-Fingerprint reader is very fast and much more accurate than my last phone.-Oxygen OS is close enough to stock android to use as is (sooo much better than One UI).-Supplied wired charger is superfast!-Camera is pretty good so far. I prefer not having super saturated photos as I did with the s20 ultra.-Comes with a case-Battery life is good, the phone lasts me the day.-Cheaper than a Samsung-The whole throttling thing-Despite that it can get quite hot under heavy load.-One+ are apparently merging oxygen OS with Colour OS and future updates will be based on that.-Not much clarity on the number of OS updates for the device (Samsung are actually good at this now, how things change).-No SD card slot or headphone jack.I guess I'm happy enough.

On the other hand, the S24, with its flagship processor, is ideal for power users and gamers. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14, though fast and optimized for iOS, tends to be pricier for delivering similar performance.In terms of display, the A55 likely features a vibrant Super AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it excellent for everyday viewing. The S24 steps up with a superior QHD+ AMOLED display, perfect for high-end content consumption. The iPhone 14 has a high-quality display but falls short of the smoother 120Hz refresh rate found in the other models.When it comes to the camera, the A55 likely boasts a 50 MP setup, offering great photos for casual users. The S24, with its advanced flagship-level camera system, delivers top-tier image quality. The iPhone 14 is reliable, though it has a lower megapixel count compared to Samsung's mid-range options.For battery life, the A55 is expected to provide all-day power on a budget, while the S24 offers fast charging and optimization aimed at power users. The iPhone 14 has decent battery life but lacks the faster charging capabilities seen in the S24.In terms of build and design, the A55 features a sleek and value-oriented design, while the S24 shines with premium materials and an IP68 rating for durability. The iPhone 14 maintains Apple's solid build with its classic design aesthetic.Finally, when considering price, the A55 offers excellent value for its performance and features. The S24 commands a high-end price reflective of its flagship status, while the iPhone 14, with its premium pricing, brings the additional benefits of Apple’s ecosystem.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mr O A SANNI', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Samsung A55 dual sim', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Amazing phone with an amazing price.

He's had it 5months now and he's been really pleased with it, the keys are nice and big so he can see to text properly and the sound his loud enough so he can hear it when it rings, and that's basically all he wanted from it.He loves the outer display so he can see whose calling him, his only complaint was about the ringtones which are very uninspiring.  I set it up for him and it seemed pretty much straight forward to me, although we did have some difficulty transfering his contacts from his old phone to his new one because we had to change sim cards, but a call to O2 sorted it all out in the end.So if your looking for a phone that does the basics, looks smart and is very easy on the eyes and ears you can't go far wrong with this one.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'David Chambers', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great little dumb phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2016', 'Review Body': ""I have no use for a smart phone and when my Samsung dumb phone starting suffering from difficult-to activate keys I looked around for another dumb phone replacement.  The TT750 fits the bill perfectly.  I really needed the larger buttons and clearer display as my close-up eye sight is not what it used to be.  The additional display on the front is useful too when the clamshell is closed and although it's slightly larger and heavier than my old Samsung it is not unduly so and still slips into a shirt pocket easily.The camera is fairly crude providing only a 240 x 320 pixel image with poor contrast and not terribly sharp but then I wasn't expecting much better from a £50 phone.  It will also shoot video of similar quality but for that you need an optional microSD memory card inserted under the battery.  The manual didn't specify memory size limits so I contacted TTphone who said they recommended cards between 8 and 16 GB, so I bought a Sandisk 16 GB card which seems to be working fine.  You can connect the phone to your PC and simply drag and drop photos and videos to your hard drive.  Photos can be used to add wallpaper to the phone's screen.I bought the red colour because it is the same as my Samsung and I think it looks very smart.  The large keys feel very positive but when texting I do wish the software made it easier to select a capital letter in the middle of a sentence ... I still haven't mastered it.  As supplied the keys talk the number pressed but I found that irritating and turned it off in the menus along with the equally irritating music when you switch the phone on and off ... silence is golden.I chose to recycle my O2 sim and the TT seems to pick up a much better signal than my Samsung did indoors so that's another bonus for me.  Audio, both received and transmitted, is very good and the speaker can be set very loud for those who are hard of hearing which is also handy if you are stuck in a noisy environment.  Earphones are supplied but I've not tried them so can't comment on their effectiveness.  It also comes with a small charging cradle or you can simply connect the USB charging lead directly into the phone at the side.  Oh, and if you find yourself in the dark, it has a torch facility activated by a button on the side of the phone.All in all a very neat little package with which I am very pleased indeed.Dave.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fabio', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 28 November 2023', 'Review Body': 'Arrivato nei tempi stabiliti.

This phone is PANTS with Bluetooth, no-one can hear you probably and you can't hear them. The Bluetooth connectivity just doesn't work well.  Which is such a shame for the cost a good phone.

He's had it 5months now and he's been really pleased with it, the keys are nice and big so he can see to text properly and the sound his loud enough so he can hear it when it rings, and that's basically all he wanted from it.He loves the outer display so he can see whose calling him, his only complaint was about the ringtones which are very uninspiring.  I set it up for him and it seemed pretty much straight forward to me, although we did have some difficulty transfering his contacts from his old phone to his new one because we had to change sim cards, but a call to O2 sorted it all out in the end.So if your looking for a phone that does the basics, looks smart and is very easy on the eyes and ears you can't go far wrong with this one.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'David Chambers', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great little dumb phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2016', 'Review Body': ""I have no use for a smart phone and when my Samsung dumb phone starting suffering from difficult-to activate keys I looked around for another dumb phone replacement.  The TT750 fits the bill perfectly.  I really needed the larger buttons and clearer display as my close-up eye sight is not what it used to be.  The additional display on the front is useful too when the clamshell is closed and although it's slightly larger and heavier than my old Samsung it is not unduly so and still slips into a shirt pocket easily.The camera is fairly crude providing only a 240 x 320 pixel image with poor contrast and not terribly sharp but then I wasn't expecting much better from a £50 phone.  It will also shoot video of similar quality but for that you need an optional microSD memory card inserted under the battery.  The manual didn't specify memory size limits so I contacted TTphone who said they recommended cards between 8 and 16 GB, so I bought a Sandisk 16 GB card which seems to be working fine.  You can connect the phone to your PC and simply drag and drop photos and videos to your hard drive.  Photos can be used to add wallpaper to the phone's screen.I bought the red colour because it is the same as my Samsung and I think it looks very smart.  The large keys feel very positive but when texting I do wish the software made it easier to select a capital letter in the middle of a sentence ... I still haven't mastered it.  As supplied the keys talk the number pressed but I found that irritating and turned it off in the menus along with the equally irritating music when you switch the phone on and off ... silence is golden.I chose to recycle my O2 sim and the TT seems to pick up a much better signal than my Samsung did indoors so that's another bonus for me.  Audio, both received and transmitted, is very good and the speaker can be set very loud for those who are hard of hearing which is also handy if you are stuck in a noisy environment.  Earphones are supplied but I've not tried them so can't comment on their effectiveness.  It also comes with a small charging cradle or you can simply connect the USB charging lead directly into the phone at the side.  Oh, and if you find yourself in the dark, it has a torch facility activated by a button on the side of the phone.All in all a very neat little package with which I am very pleased indeed.Dave.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fabio', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 28 November 2023', 'Review Body': 'Arrivato nei tempi stabiliti.

Deal breaker was finding stuff that simply doesn't work.

Designed with a sturdy base and adjustable components, this stand aims to provide a stable and customizable viewing experience for users.One of the standout features of the Tablet Phone Stand is its adjustability. The stand offers multiple angles, allowing you to position your device at the perfect angle for viewing, typing, or video calls. This flexibility is particularly useful for reducing neck strain during prolonged use and adapting to different work or leisure environments.The build quality of the stand is solid, with a well-constructed frame that supports a range of device sizes and weights. The non-slip pads on the base and support arms help keep the stand securely in place, minimizing the risk of accidental slips or falls. Additionally, the stand's design is compact and lightweight, making it easy to move and store when not in use.However, the stand’s adjustability might be limited compared to more premium models. Some users may find that it doesn’t offer as many adjustment options or as robust support for heavier devices. Additionally, while the design is functional, it may not have the same aesthetic appeal as more stylish or designer stands.Overall, the Tablet Phone Stand is a practical and reliable accessory for holding and viewing devices.

Lors de l\'utilisation de son écran l\'ensemble reste très stable, il est prévu pour supporter un poids jusqu’à 900 g.La partie haute qui support le dos des appareils est bien plus haute et large que celle des supports prévus pour les téléphones avec ses dimensions de 14,8 cm x 8 cm. La base ronde de 12,6 cm de diamètre assure une bonne stabilité de l\'ensemble. En raison de sa taille il prend forcément plus de place sur un bureau mais peut aussi être utilisé pour un téléphone de taille plus classique .La construction est solide tout en aluminium anodisé gris foncé et présente une bonne finition. Les deux charnières offrent une résistance assez forte lors de l\'ajustement des angles du pied qui rassure sur le fait que ça ne bougera pas malgré le poids soutenu.La base comporte 4 grands patins en silicone, il ne glisse pas même sur une surface très lisse. Des protections de la même matière sont présentes sur les crochets de maintien en U et sur la plaque afin de préserver la coque des appareils. Une autre a été collée sur une des charnières afin d\'éviter que le dos du support l\'abîme lorsqu\'il est plié.La rotation se fait à 360° sans aucune butée dans les deux sens. Elle peut être faite cran par cran et un bruit de cliquetis se fait entendre pendant l\'utilisation. Sur l\'exemplaire reçu lors de mes 1ères utilisations je devais maintenir la base pour faire tourner le pied. Je l\'ai démonté grâce aux deux vis sous la basse. Après avoir à peine un peu desserré les 4 vis internes et un peu de dégrippant la rotation est devenue plus facile. Le mécanisme est en plastique dur (voir photo)Sa construction et sa taille le rendent assez lourd avec un poids de 277 gr, une fois plié il reste transportable avec des dimensions de 14,8 cm x 12,6 cm par 3,6 cm d\'épaisseur.Très bien adapté aux tablettes, liseuses et téléphones de grands formats.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Philippe', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 7 January 2024', 'Review Body': 'La page du produit ne livrant aucune information, voici celles que fournit le carton d\'emballage, ce stand est libellé ""pour iPad"", mais il convient évidemment aux autres tablettes et téléphones à conditions qu\'ils pèsent moins de 900 grammes ± 50 g.

Default text size is fairly large so the slightly visually impaired may like this. - Battery: lasts a long while! - Face Recognition: It works; not always, but neither did my previous phone.  Choose the angle properly and it\'s fine. - Cost: at £60 it\'s really hard to falter, except for the below.THE BAD: - Storage!  You may, like I did, believe 16GB be sufficient for a few apps.  Once you get the phone and update it, you have a grand total of 3 to 4GB left.You may also like I did, believe you can simply plop in a Micro SD card and format it for internal storage to alleviate this concern: however, app developers can specify in the manifest where their app gets stored- almost all of them have INTERNAL specified and will not be installed on the SD card.-- It\'s a late 2022 model iirc; a 32GB chip wouldn\'t have affected the cost and should\'ve been used instead!-- Most default apps like Shitgle\'s camera default to storing internally and don\'t let you choose somewhere else; so frequent file moving is required (or if you have enough space, install Open Camera instead).-- You\'ll get a notification for ""Your storage is nearly full! Device functionality may not work as intended"" a LOT.- USB connectivity: just does not work.  Developer mode enabled and proper settings configured this phone simply refuses to allow a USB connection.SUMMARY:If you don\'t install a lot of programs, and need a relatively big screen on a device with a decent battery, this is for you!Otherwise, carefully consider if you can put up with the restraints of extremely limited storage because you CANNOT fully extend it with a micro SD (unless you root the device)Apps installed: Uber Driver, Discord, TelegramX, Nationwide, Lidl Plus, Nova Launcher, Muzio Player, Polar FlowSpace left: under 1GB.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ray', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Easy and handy to use', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2023', 'Review Body': 'Good value for money.

Ich habe natürlich nicht alle Funktionen ausprobiert, halt nur das, was mir wichtig ist.Der 4500 mA Akku hält bei mir ungefähr 2 – 3 Tage, allerdings schaue ich nicht minütlich darauf und höre auch wenig Musik über das Smartphone.Der Qualcom 865 lässt alle Anwendungen schnell und flüssig arbeiten. Ich habe interessehalber Filme gesehen und es gab kein Ruckeln und die Farben waren sehr angenehm.Kurz nach der Inbetriebnahme wurde Android 11 ausgerollt. Die Oberfläche gefällt mir gut und ich habe die wichtigsten Apps auf der Startseite angeordnet. Die Facebook-App ist für mich uninteressant und konnte ohne Probleme deinstalliert werden.Als Sicherheitsfunktion nutze ich den Fingerabdrucksensor, ein Passwort und die Anbindung an einen Samsung-Account.  Das Scannen des Abdruckes verlief ohne Probleme.Wichtig waren mir die Fotofunktionen und die dazugehörende Foto-App. Da ich mit verschiedenen DSLR-Kameras fotografiere und auch Bildbearbeitung beherrsche, kann ich die Möglichkeiten der Kamera einschätzen. Die Kamera fotografiert im JPEG- und RAW-Modus bei entsprechenden Einstellungen. Der neue HEIF-Modus sagt mir jetzt noch nicht so viel.Ich hatte vorher das LG 4, welches schon eine sehr gute Kamera mitbrachte. Das Samsung S 20 FE übertrifft das alte Gerät bei Weitem. Kritik zum ""Kamerabuckel"" trifft bei mir nicht zu. Wie immer nutze ich eine Lederhülle von Stilgut. Der Kameraausschnitt und alle anderen Ausschnitte sitzen dort perfekt. Das Smartphone hat übrigens werksseitig eine Schutzfolie auf dem Glas, mehr brauche ich nicht, alles ist gut geschützt. Alle ""Plastikanmutung"" haben mit dieser Hülle keine Bedeutung. Ich sehe und fühle sie schlichtweg nicht.Die Farben sind sehr natürlich und eher dezent. Bei gutem Licht gelingen die Fotos immer. Sie sind scharf und es gibt keinerlei Unschärfen durch Wackeln. Selbst bei Fotos mit wenigem Licht, gelingt eigentlich alles sehr gut. Ich habe mal abends beim Fernsehen (55""Flat), 40%tigem Deckenlicht plus einer gedimmten LED Standleute fotografiert und die Kamera hat den großen Kontrastumfang spielend bewältigt. Schatten hatten immer noch Zeichnung, die hellen Stellen waren nicht überbelichtet, die Farbe fast wie im Original. Ich fand das erstaunlich und habe mit dem HDR-Modus, ohne und Nachtaufnahme experimentiert. Die Unterschiede waren geringfügig und sind halt manchmal auch Geschmackssache. Selfies werden natürlich wiedergegeben. Ein großer Unterschied zu den Fähigkeiten des LG G4, welches da immer unvorteilhaft und unnatürlich ""geglättet"" hat.Die Fotoapp ist umfangreich und im Pro-Modus lassen sich viele individuelle Einstellungen vornehmen, bis hin zum komplett manuellen Einstellen. Die Software erkennt bestimmte Motive wie Essen, Blumen, Gesichter, Bewegung etc. Kann man nutzen, ist nicht unbedingt erforderlich. Wer sich etwas in der Technik der Fotografie auskennt, kann die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten der Kamera und der dazugehörigen Software nutzen und ausprobieren. Macht richtig Spaß und mehr braucht man nicht. Für alles andere nutze ich halt dass ""große Equipment"".Telefonieren ist in Ordnung: Der Klang ist angenehm und die Sprache verständlich und laut genug. Musikhören: Die Lautsprecher kommen in Relationen zu ihrer Winzigkeit akzeptabel rüber. Ich vergleiche sie natürlich nicht mit meinen Canton-Boxen und einer HiFi-Anlage.Was hat mir noch gefallen: RAM und interner Speicher sind für mich völlig ausreichend. Ich überspiele halt auch mal Fotos auf mein NAS. Das interne Benutzerhandbuch ist sehr umfangreich und nützlich. Ich kann es nur empfehlen, wenn man mal die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten und Funktionen des S20 kennenlernen und vielleicht nutzen möchte. Ach ja, ich habe die 5G-Version und bin hoffentlich etwas für die Zukunft gerüstet?Was hat mir nicht gefallen: Eigentlich nur die fehlenden Kopfhörerbuchse. Ich habe mir den originalen Samsung USB-C Kopfhörer Adapter bestellt und hören per Kopfhörer mit Kabel funktioniert nicht. Der Sennheiser Momentum Stecker wackelt auch in der Buchse und es ist halt nichts zu hören. Vielleicht mache ich etwas falsch? Über Bluetooth habe ich es noch nicht ausprobiert, da ich keinen entsprechenden Kopfhörer habe. Ansonsten funktioniert Bluetooth aber und ich kann Spotify über meine Anlage und auch über die MusiCast App hören und steuern.Fazit: Tolles Smartphone ohne wirkliche Einschränkungen. Ich habe es zudem über ein ""Angebot des Tages"" günstig erworben. Ich persönlich kann es nur empfehlen und vermisse nichts und bin der Meinung, dass Samsung ein großer Wurf gelungen ist. Ich würde mal sagen, es ist vielleicht nicht ""State of the Art"", aber absolut ausreichend und ein Mehr muss dann viel teurer erkauft werden und ist vielleicht  auch wenig sichtbar bzw. nutzbar.Ergänzung: Ich benutze das S20 jetzt seit über 2 Jahren täglich. Nach ca. einem Jahr ist die Taste zum Ein- und Ausschalten herausgefallen. Samsung hat das im Rahmen der Garantie repariert und das Gerät hat ein neues Gehäuse bekommen. Das S20 hat inzwischen ein Update auf die Version 13 erhalten. Ich bin weiterhin sehr zufrieden.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'LUDOVIC  PALOMBA', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 12 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Conforme à la commande, livré rapidement et bien emballé.Merci\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Klea', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 11 March 2024', 'Review Body': 'Ho conprato questo telefono perché al mio s21 si è gonfiata la batteria e non si accende più.

Wir haben ein neues robustes und technisch absolut brauchbares Outdoorsmartphone erhalten und für unsere Bedürfnisse, ein stabiles und funktionelles neues Smartphone gefunden, den erweiterbaren Arbeitsspeicher möchte ich nicht mehr missen! Bei dem Preis denke ich läuft das alles auf einem sehr fairen Niveau ab! ✅Wir haben das Oukitel Smartphone nun seit gut einer Woche in Nutzung und sind sehr begeistert und das doch entgegen der Erfahrungen manch anderer Kunden, die gerne bemängeln, dass die Outdoorhandys, abgesehen von CAT und Co., zu langsam und nicht wirklich funktional wären.Da ich bereits einige andere Outdoorsmartphones hatte, darunter auch drei Oukitel sowie über 20 Monate das Blackview BV6000, denke ich das hier schon einen kleinen Erfahrungsvorsprung haben dürfte.Wir (mein Sohn und ich) haben uns das Smartphone zuschicken lassen mit dem Wissen, dass unabhängig davon sich doch bis dato alle mir bekannten Outdoor-Smartphones nach ein gemeinsames Schicksal teilen. Die Outdoorfähigkeit ging immer zulasten der Performance.💡Dies hat sich mit der neuen Generation an Geräten seit 2022 (siehe z. B. Ulefone Power Armour 13) doch erheblich geändert und man wird nun, so wie ich auch aktuell, viel Freude an seinem Gerät haben.Ganz ehrlich – ich bin von dem hier gebotenen Outdoorgerät, welches wir in unserer Werkstatt, im Garten und am Wochenende zum Geocaching nutzen bei dem aktzeptablen Preis absolut zufrieden.Der erste Eindruck:Es liegt wesentlich geschmeidiger und dennoch Massiv in der Hand, teilwiese hatten wir schon Brocken in Nutzung bei denen man das Telefonieren alternativ zum Hanteltraining hätte nutzen können..Optik/Haptik des Geräts:Das Smartphone liegt, wie bereits beschrieben, mir sehr gut in der Hand, vorausgesetzt man möchte auch etwas zum zu packen haben!Die optische und haptische Beschaffenheit des Gehäuses gefallen mir, das merkt man innerhalb der ersten Sekunden. Das Balancing passt einfach!Es ist für meine Begriffe extrem gut verarbeitet und fühlt sich sehr wertig an. Achteckig und akuraten Bumpern versehen.Alles gut gegen Dreck und Feuchtigkeit abgedichtet. Im Vergleich zum Blackview ist hier der USB-Slot auch soweit vorgezogen, dass man mit jedem herkömmlichen USB-Stecker heran kommen dürfte. Das sollte Standard werden!Die Rückkamera welche mit einer 48 Megapixel Cam bestückt ist und der 8 MP Frontkamera runden den ersten zufriedenstellenden und durchaus Zweckmäßigen Eindruck ab. Auch hier sei angemerkt, dass Nachtaufnahmen (der Night Vision Modus) mit dem WP50 Pro recht gut zu machen sind, Wunder allerdings sollte man aber hier nicht erwarten. Da muss man schon tiefer in die Tasche greifen!Bei normalen Tageslicht bin ich mit den Bildern zu 95 Prozent zufrieden.Das Display ist so gut verbaut, dass es auch kleinere Stürze problemlos aushält ohne direkt in tausend Teile zu Zerspringen. Das Displayglas ist ordentlich robust (CGG5) und hat nebenbei noch eine sehr angenehm gleitend leichte Haptik.Bedienung/Technik:Das Smartphone muss bei der ersten Inbetriebnahme natürlich erstmal ordentlich geladen werden. Hierzu ist zu bemerken, dass der Akku im Gerät fest verbaut wurde. Dieser Umstand ist der Outdoortauglichkeit geschuldet. Das Smartphone benötigt bei Komplettentladung ca. 2 Std.-2,5 Std.Stunden um wieder auf der Höhe zu sein.Das Smartphone verfügt über einen 256 GB großen internen Speicher. Der Arbeitsspeicher hat satte 4+8 GB RAM, welcher über Virtual Ram ergänzt werden kann (zieht dann aber auch etwas an der Akku-Leistung). Das war bisher immer ein Manko gewesen und war meiner Meinung nach auch mal längst überfällig.Betrieben wird das Gerät mit Android 14, welches erwartungsgemäß ohne Einschränkungen sehr ordentlich läuft.Bluetooth:Die Verbindung zu meiner PKW-Freisprecheinrichtung,Kopfhörern sowie diversen Bluetooth-Lautsprecherboxen funktioniert prima. Das Pairing erfolgt binnen weniger Sekunden und ist Stabil und mit älteren Geräten auch abwärtskompatibel nutzbar. Hier zum Beispiel mit meinem Teufel Lautsprecher.GPSErwartungsgemäß, da dies ein Herausstellungsmerkmal der Oukitel Telefone ist, funktioniert das GPS auf dem Gerät einwandfrei. GPS unter freiem Himmel funktioniert in der Regel locker unter 10 Sekunden.Leistung/Gaming/VideosDie verbaute Hardware macht das Spielen mittelgroßer Games am Smartphone recht flüssig und eigentlich ohne merkliche Leistungseinbußen möglich. Aufwendige Games zehren an der Performance und hier kann es dann und wann schon mal zu „Hängepartien“ kommen.Klasse hingegen ist das schauen von Videos via YouTube und Co..Die folgenden Video Formate werden durch das Telefon unterstützt AAC, AMR, AMR-NB, GSM-AMR, eAAC+, aacPlus v2, HE-AAC v2, MIDI, MP3, WMA und WAV und die Audio Formate 3GPP, AVI, H263, H264, MPEG4, MP4, WMV und Xvid.Der Akku:Bei dem fest verbauten Akku handelt es sich um einen 6500 mAh starken Lithium-Ionen-Akku. Dies ergibt nach Komplettladung eine durchschnittliche Handynutzung ca. - 1,5-2 Tagen.Das Display:Die Arbeit mit dem Display funktioniert auch unter freiem Himmel sehr gut. Die Auflösung ist mit 720x1612 gestochen scharf! Das gilt für den allgemeinen Betrieb genauso wie für Filme und Fotos. Der Blickwinkel ist passabel weit und wie bei den bekannten Markengeräten. Das gilt vor allem beim Blick von schräg oben. Definitiv mehr als ein plumpes Baustellentelefon!

That is its main concept, you need to use the features, otherwise this is just another phone but with some cool light effects on the back.The opinion on the design is ultimately up to you, but I love it's visible components concept, even if its curated and only some of it is shown.The glyphs seem like a niche feature, but they work well and are high quality. They add a whole new dimension to how your phone responds and provides you with non-text based information. I like to use the glyph timer, it's silent and is perfect for allowing regular breaks between periods of work.Uses a snapdragon 8+ gen 1, a more power efficient compared to the non plus version. It is a 2-3 year old flagship processor now I believe, but it still holds up pretty well in games so it's perfectly capable of anything you expect from a phone.Battery is big enough for a work day, if you are playing games on it all day, you will need to charge it of course.The screen is very good, one of my favourite features is the extra dim mode, at absolute minimum brightness it is comfortable to view in a dark room.The phone uses a lot of Google's own apps: Google files, photos. I don't find them as good as phone manufacturers' own file and photo managers, as some key features are missing from Google's.There is no bloatware and the nothing phone is laser focused on providing a clutter free and minimal phone experience.IP rating should be good enough to not worry about the rain, I would avoid it in the bath though.I recommend getting some protective accessories, I found the phone to be a bit slippery and unwieldy, a phone case provided extra grip.Cameras are good, sometimes takes better photos than my mirror less camera. The ultra wide camera is invaluable for interior photos of rooms or for very large buildings and scenery where you want to capture everything.Video capture at 1080p or 4k, 30 or 60fps, with slow-motion up to 480 FPS at 1080pIf there is anything and to say it would be the automatic brightness control for the phone's screen and the rotation detection, they don't seem to work too well under certain conditions (maybe it is because it's under a lightbulb?)For context: I brought my phone used, very good condition from Amazon warehouse for ~£480My previous phone lasted me about 5 years, and I plan to keep this phone even longer. this phone ticked off every box and more that I wanted from a new phone, and I wasn't even following the nothing hype.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tara Walker', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Brilliant phone, life changing buy, super tech', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone: built to last, perfect weight, beautiful design.

I am not technically minded and will not be going on about OS and other technology during the review! That aside let's begin. It has been such along time since I used a Android phone and to be honest I am not sure why I became a slave to apple. I have not been a flagship apple user for nearly 4 years, using the SE range which at the time gave me everything I needed. I found myself in a situation where I needed a larger screened phone and something which gave me more options when it came to the cameras for some digital photography. I had a good look at the iPhone 14 and 15, there was no way I was going to pay nearly £1000 for a phone, plus change for a flagship model, so I began to look around. Looked at Google Pixel, OnePlus and a few others and this phone really stood out and it wasn't because of the flashy light thingy on the back! 1st of all the general mission statement stood out for me, decent technology, recycling built in and stylish design for a fair price. To be fair that is prity much what you get with this device. A nice large screen with a good quality refresh rate, more than good enough to catch the odd video or catch up TV program. The OS is slick and simple, you don't need to press hold turn and triple tap to get your phone to perform some amazing hidden task. Personally I like the the wallpapers and the choice of apps off play store. You don't get the frequent OS updates you get from apple but I didn't expect to either. I got mine when it was on offer with £50 pounds off  the listed price but to be honest I would have paid the £549 listed price and I feel I would still have been happy. Its a light phone and quite slick because of the glass back, I didn't want to wrap it in a case as it comes with a glass screen protector applied on delivery but I almost let it fly twice so got a nice clear case that shows off the gubbins under the rear case and the ghlphy light jobby. As I mentioned at the start I am not going to technology bamboozle people with jargon and technically minded information, as I would be copying and pasting most of it!!!! It looks good, it feels good and it works very, very well. I am very happy and when it all boils down to it, that's what's important isn't it?\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jerry S.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 21 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'fast delivery, and good for the price\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alex rush', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 30 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""People always mistake this for an iPhone and I think it's a really good phone to transition from iPhone to Android because they have an option for it to look very iPhone and it's fast it has a good camera it's not you know the Samsung cameras but they are good.

The above characteristics really prove that this phone punches above its weight and size.Of course, the  quality of the screen is not the same as on a larger smartphones, but due to its size, you don't really feel that big of a difference.I was very much concerned  that because of the screen size it will have a low responsiveness, but everything worked all right – even my butterfingers managed to press always correct))).I really liked this wallet size phone, it looks very cute and it is also very compact.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'David Moreno', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Faulty products', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'The concept is good with a small phone but I received a faulty phone that turns off  and needs to be connected to power source, missing items for the phone.
