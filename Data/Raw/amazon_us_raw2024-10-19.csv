I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'bolo919', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'After much research, trial and error, I bought this phone for several reasons:  1) Good screen size.. prefer the larger screen size than s23 or  s23 fe; 2) Adequate/decent performance specs of processor, camera etc 3) Expandable storage 4) Lowest SAR (radiation) values of any modern Esim phone Ive researched.. Yes i know they say its safe non-ionizing radiation... blah blah.. they said smoking and lead paint were ok too. I use my phone A lot.. tell it to the next guy buddy lol.  5) Price was reasonable enough. Anyway, the phone has been generally amazing so far, much faster and smoother than my old one.  Beautiful screen, although every once in a while some text has a barely noticeable very slight flicker on certain apps/ scripts? I shut off adaptive display something or other, which helped, but again barely noticeable and almost never happens.  Generally amazing, very fast, vibrant, and smooth thanks to the quality display and fast refresh rate.  I used a usb-c flash drive along with Samsung\'s ""Smart switch"" app to backup my old phone (motorola) then transfer onto the A35.  Esim setup was a breeze on US mobile\'s warp (verizon) network - so long as you have *this model* of the A35, which is the US Version (The US Version is A356u, NOT the cheaper latin american/ international A356E.. and probably also the international A55 could have compatibility issues too.. I dont know - I believe the a55 is only available in an international version - Samsung wants you to buy thd s23 fe instead.. The US unlocked models will have the best compatibility with your carrier if u live in the US - yes they are more expensive... anyway I digress)  So far this phone has been generally great.  I have purchased another one to have two lines on the A35.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Baltazar A.

Now, unless you’re a hardcore mobile gamer—like the type who could probably win a Fortnite match with your eyes closed—this phone should have more than enough juice for your everyday needs.For daily use, the A35 performs solidly. Its camera is decent, letting you capture everything from quick snapshots to carefully curated social media posts. And as for Samsung’s OneUI, Android purists might groan about the customizations, but I’m all for it. It’s a far cry from the old days of TouchWiz (anyone else remember that colorful chaos?), and now OneUI adds genuinely useful features like battery charging optimization that’s kinder to your battery health—something stock Android doesn’t offer out of the box, and you probably can’t just add on afterward, either. Plus, Samsung promises four major updates for the A35, which is impressive for a budget phone in this class, especially when competitors in this price range often tap out after one—if you’re lucky!The A35 also includes SD card support, so you’ve got plenty of space for photos, music, and all your favorite memes. My one real gripe? No raw API support for the camera. I mean, my cheaper Galaxy A9+ tablet has it—so what’s the deal, Samsung?At this price point, you could go for a flagship, but you’d be looking at the price of two A35s—or even three! For me, the A35 hits that perfect sweet spot of not-too-cheap and not-too-expensive. It’s affordable enough that you won’t feel like you need to keep it in a bulletproof case, but powerful enough that you won’t feel like you’re carrying around a paperweight. Overall, I’d say the A35 is like that dependable friend who always shows up with snacks but never leaves you broke.\nRead more'}]",A-Series,120 Hz,Galaxy A35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

I purchased my original Moto 5G in 2019 and for a very long time I was very hesitant in replacing it with a newer version. Even though I did consider briefly buying a Moto 7G Phone in 2022 but I just wasn’t impressed with the unusual changes Motorola made just to make it look and work “different”. However, when I first saw this 2023 Version I was very happy to see that a lot things were back to the way I remembered them before changes they made to the Interface were actually ones that I liked. Such as Swiping down on the Homescreen “twice” instead of “once” to Auto-Rotate the Screen, which I used to accidentally do all the time. I know that something like this is very minor but it’s just one of the many ways Moto rethought the Interface to be more user-friendly.IMPORTANT POINTS:  This Phone has a Three-Day Battery Life, which is truly excellent! The feel, the weight and the look of it is really nice and it fits in my hand and pocket perfectly. The Display Screen and Refresh Rate is top notch and the Performance is Fantastic! Another BIG PLUS for me is that it has a 256GB of Storage as compared to 128GB. Also this Phone still has a Headphone Jack (Yay!) and it comes with a Phone Charger in the Box, which the 2024 Version does NOT have.THE ONLY NEGATIVE: For some reason Motorola thought that I wanted to have Tik-Tok and another App already Installed and it was difficult to remove it. By the way, I heard that the Moto g Power 5G 2024 has A LOT more of these Applications ALREADY installed, which is absolutely something I do NOT want at all.NOTE: I intentionally did NOT purchase the 2024 Version of the Moto g Power 5G partially because of the “reimagined” Interface, nor all of the massive amount of ALREADY installed “Bloatware” I’ve been reading about. Also, since I am very concerned about Security, I did NOT want the New NFC (Near Field Communications) which would include my Credit Card, Tap to Pay and other Financial information on my Cellphone. Although, I would have liked to have the New Wireless Charging Feature but it was something I able to live without.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'jeremy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything is Great, but please read if buying 2023 version', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Everything works fine. Very solid phone. Supports 5g. What\'s to complain?? Well, for me it\'s the charge speed. In this day & age not having fast charging is a sin. I will be keeping the 2023 version as a backup phone or might just return it. Just ordered the 2024 version which supposedly supports fast charging & wireless charging. Been charging this phone since I got it & it\'s been about 3 hours or so. I went from 40% to 61%. Literally as I\'m typing this. Just had to let people know since no one talked about it at all. If this isn\'t an issue for you, then this phone is your perfect phone. Otherwise I use my phone a lot so needing a full 5-6 hours to fully charge your phone daily is not ideal for me. Most reviews say Battery life seems to be quite good. Just the charge process seems bad. For me at least. I like to go out occasionally & knowing my phone will not easily charge fast should it hit zero doesn\'t put me at ease. For example like camping & using GPS or even using it to play music. In my experience phones will eventually die after a full day regardless of battery life. Meaning it will take at least 3-4 hours to hit 0% to 20%. Sorry, for the long scenario review. I just wished this product said it wasn\'t compatible with fast charging. Although to be fair it never said it did.Hope this helps anyone to make a solid decision on buying the ""2023"" version of the Moto G Power. This is a solid phone, just a bit of a relic in charge technology.-Originally 3 Star Review**Update**9/16/20242023 version works solid. Only been 2 days but I\'ve gotten the gist of it. It\'s definitely going to be my backup phone. No changes since my initial review. Battery life is standard. I don\'t play gaming apps much anymore so I can\'t say how gaming potential really is. Maybe someone else will do a stress test in regards to that. Still I\'m a bit bummed about the no NFC & charging seems to have gotten better. A bit inconsistent with charge speed, but maybe it\'s just me or it doesn\'t like my lightning cables. otherwise very solid phone. Overall review 8.5/10. Perfect if you aren\'t too nit picky about tech & current accessibility.2024 Version. Yeah, as I thought. Just using it I can feel it\'s more up to speed with modern times. Has NFC. Wireless Charge Capabilities. Camera is pretty good. Solid overall. With all the bells & whistles on battery life is good. I mean could optimize it to performance mode but what\'s the fun in that?? Otherwise this is a straight upgrade from the 2023 version. I wouldn\'t call it perfect, but I can say I can recommend it without hesitation. Definitely better than the LG G8 Thinq I had & I absolutely loved the LG G series. Oh & having the fingerprint scanner to the side where the power button is located is a nice feature. Although screen shots are a bit awkward if you try to use traditional inputs. This phone offers a shortcut. When placing 3 fingers (imagine a dog/cat paw formation) on the screen it will take a screenshot.  Although the emergency override with +Volume & Power button are both on one side so that\'s definitely annoying. Probably my only real con. 9.5/10, I would say it\'s a 10 but there are better phones out there. However for the Best bang for your buck. This is definitely a steal.-5 stars for both versions now that I understand what I\'m working with. Unfortunate that I was unsatisfied with the 2023 version, but like I said. Would make a great backup phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Spinner', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on May 15, 2023', 'Review Body': 'This my 3rd Moto phone over the past 9 years.

I use it as a phone, for email, to text, to access the internet, for Zoom, to navigate, to take photos, and a bunch of lesser things like controlling my alarm system and thermometer, reading the Washington Post etc.  What I don’t do is game and social media.The most important things I want in a phone are that it does what I need, which it does, and that it be stable and robust – it’s a Samsung -- nuf said.I had been using a Samsung Galaxy J7 for the past five years but finally decided that it just didn’t have enough memory so I got the A15 which has about 4x more memory and seems perfectly adequate.  Aside from inadequate memory, my old J7 worked perfectly and still does.I see some complaints about the A15 being slow.  It seems fine for my uses, but you’ve probably guessed by now that I’m not exactly a tech expert, power user type.  I can tell you that videos and Zoom operate smoothly.  It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn’t know.I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn’t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my cell service provider.  Speaking of cost: for my uses, why would I spend 4 to 6 times more for a high-end phone -- really?The battery seems fine.  I let it charge at night but it so far has never gone below 80% during an average day’s use.  The screen is large and sharp and the cameras seem to do a fine job.  I could only wish that it was smaller and lighter and that it had cordless charging but for the price I’m not complaining.FYI:  The phone weighs 7.57 oz (0.47lbs) and the dimensions are 6 ¼”  x  3”\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mike Mai', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone under $200', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Great phone for under $200, I use this for school at home, and in public, honestly, it's got great performance, and new features being added.

And I don\'t play games on it.  But everything I have used works great.Besides working fine, what else is there to say?First, the battery life is great -- I put it on a shelf to just be an alarm clock for 24 hours, and it used about 15% of the battery.  Even with some web browsing and a lot of podcast listening during the day, I have never seen the battery below 45%, charging it once a day.The screen is bright and clear and big (for the phone\'s size), with refresh rate of 60Hz normally and 120Hz while scrolling (you can tell w/developer tools).  There are better phone screens, but I never find myself wishing it were better.  There is a black dot where the selfie camera is, but that\'s the price you pay for a wall-to-wall screen.The rear camera is 48M pixels, like the new Google Pixel phones.  I don\'t know if it\'s actually as good, but if I want to do art photography, I don\'t use a phone.  It has a separate macro lens that you can select easily with the camera app, and I have never had trouble getting a sharp photo of anything, yet.  Like the screen, I\'ve never wished it was better.The built-in speakers are unexpectedly good: there\'s one at each end, and, yeah, they do stereo as well as you can expect for speakers 4"" apart, I guess, but the sound quality and volume are significantly better than typical for reasonably-priced phones.The cell reception is better than the Pixel phones I\'ve used, but, surprisingly, not as good as some Samsungs (cell reception used to be a real strong point for Moto).Unlike most top-tier phones, it has an SD card holder (as well as a physical micro-SIM holder).  So you can add another half a terabyte (512GB) of storage for $20, if you like.  Eat your heart out, iPhone users.  According to Moto, it can take up to 1 TB (1024 GB).TL/DR: I would say this phone does everything well (of the things it does), without doing anything brilliantly, except battery life.  For its middle-of-the road price, it\'s a VERY good choice.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'tim dunn', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent Phone with Wonderful Motorola-added Features', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Purchased new during 2024 October Prime Days sale for $200.Excellent phone with solid feel and function.

It receives and makes calls and takes pretty good pictures, though I\'m not a big picture taking person, so others may have issues, don\'t know. The 5G service is quite nice and allows for a better connection when we are out in the country than my old TCL 30 4g. The screen is vivid and the look of video/pics/etc is pretty good.The bad:Everything is Google, there is no native barebones alternatives like my old TCL 30. It\'s annoying being asked to set up all the different google apps every time I need to open one... If I wanted to use all the features of each one, I would. Ex: I just want to see the pictures I\'ve taken, I don\'t want to be reminded to set up the app to save my pics to the cloud every damned time I open it. I use it to take pics of electrical schematics so I can complete my work without returning to the stand book to verify different connections etc ... It\'s almost like Google saying ""are you suuuuuure you don\'t want to"" every time like I\'m a child or something.... It\'s very annoying and slows me down.The UglyBattery life is absolutely horrible. My old phone, with the same battery size, could stream Spotify to my earbuds through an entire shift and not be less than 60% battery, even after 2 years of doing this every Mon-Fri for 9-10 hours a day. The first day I used this Motorola the same way, my battery was down to 30% when I punched out to go home. That\'s absolutely pathetic. If it wasn\'t for the fact that this was a sub-$200 phone, I would have returned it and gotten another TCL phone. This is the main reason I gave this a 3 star rating. If you don\'t stream music all day like I do, or use it all day like a younger person then it would probably last longer. As with most things, your milage may vary....Another serious negative is the button arrangement and shared capabilities, I\'ll explain.The phone has the typical up/down volume button above the power button on the right side of the screen. The issue comes when the power button is also the fingerprint sensor. It\'s nice to just brush it to open the phone, but it\'s absolutely annoying when taking a screenshot or trying to restart the phone. It seems to just spaz out when hitting up volume + power button for a screenshot to restart, or any of the other button combos the phone is capable of.Overall, for someone who doesn\'t stream music it\'s a decent unlocked phone, but for someone who actually does it\'s a no go because of battery life. That and the \'Bad\' section above is why this is a 3 star phone at best. I honestly feel Im being generous giving it 3 stars as this is gonna be a $180 paperweight when unlocked TCL 50s hit Amazon....\nRead more'}]",,120 Hz,Moto G 5G 2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

Soy técnico de celulares, por lo que tengo mucho conocimiento y espero poder ayudarles.Quiero dejar claro que compré al vendedor CellFeeee a pesar de que es el de USA y yo México No me cobraron impuestos de aduana, ya que vienen incluidos en el precio final. El envío tardó alrededor de 4 días y el teléfono vino en una caja blanca que claramente no es original y con un cargador genérico que no tengo ni idea si es certificado.En cuanto al teléfono, es completamente liberado y no tiene problemas de funcionamiento. Yo compré la calidad excelente y solo tenía una pequeña rayadura casi imperceptible cerca de la carga, lo más notable son unos puntitos negros en la tapa (estos puntitos pueden ser debidos al pegamento que le ponen a la tapa ya que aveces se come la pintura el pegamento pero no son notorios a 30cm) . Si eres muy exigente con la estética de tus teléfonos, te recomendaría pensarlo antes de comprarlo.Las piezas son originales, La batería es imposible saber si es original ya que tendría que abrirlo, pero pues tiene duración, la pantalla es completamente original, la tapa también es original y tiene un procesador Snapdragon 888 con 12GB de RAM. Las cámaras toman buenas fotos y el teléfono es bastante rápido. A pesar de que pagué por la calidad excelente, puede haber detalles mínimos, así que si no te importan esos pequeños detalles, te lo recomendaría. Sobre la bateria yo la cargo del 15% hasta el 85% para evitar el deterioro y esto me dura de 7am hasta las 6pm casi todo el dia.  el vendedor  te da un papel donde dice de cuanto es la batería, según mi batería era del 97% es decir casi nueva y si en efecto dura bastante.Sobre los juegos por si alguien le gusta jugar COD mobile o juegos que usan muchos recursos. yo utilizo graficos altos y si se calienta, pero es mínimo, cuando juegas con altos graficos si se baja la batería un poco rápido  claro recomiendo siempre usar ahorro de bateria y quitar la ram virtual (ya que la ram virtual no sirve de mucho en estos teléfonos provoca calentamiento y ningún juego o app utilizara toda la rama ya que tiene bastante)En resumen, a pesar de los pequeños detalles que mencioné, si no te molestan estos aspectos, el teléfono es rápido y funcional y si yo lo recomiendo.

The Ulephone had failed due to a leaky battery.The Moto G was easy to set up. First, I opened up the box and noted that the user manual had a ""quick start"" manual that was too brief.  As per the quick start leaflet I put in the memory card and the sim card from my old phone. The battery showed a 60% charge so I immediately shut down the phone and charged it up to 100%.  Meanwhile I did a search for ""Moto G Play 2023 User Manual"" and downloaded the 62 page  (very useful) ""User Guide.""  Be sure to get this manual (is is a pdf file) and it is full of  information.  The old SDcard needed to be reformatted and this manual tells how to do this. The Moto G has an Andriod 12 operating system and has ""VOLTE"" which is a requirement in our area for using the local AT&T cell towers.VOLTE give you more range and greater clarity than the old communications protocol. After about 90 minutes of charging I was at 100% and I did the initial; startup procedure  described in the downloaded manual.  The phone connected to the AT&T tower with no problems.  I made my first phone call and the sound level was more than adequate.  I have a hearing disability so I expect most people would say that the phone is \'loud.""  I also downloaded a Kindle book  ($2.99)  that told me details about using Android 12. If you want the book  do a search on the Amazon site for ""Android 12 user manual"".  Most people will not get this manual but I am happy to have the extra information provided in this well-written book about the Android 12 OS.  I bought the Moto play because I needed a phone and did not care about playing games, reading kindle books, or ""living on the phone.""  The Moto G can do all of that but you would be better off to buy a much more advanced unit that costs several time as much as the Moto G.  I much prefer using a separate (large) Kindle for reading, a  dedicated gaming computer,  and  desktop computer with multiple screens for other activities.  Overall, the Moto G does exactly what I wanted (a good phone)  at a reasonable price.  I also downloaded a few apps from the app store and they worked properly.  I rate this phone as being better than expected and well worth the low price.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Brian M.

On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it  would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is  budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer.

The A15 4G international version definitely works on the Bell network in Canada, and the total cost to get it shipped to my door was around $280 CAD for a phone a little over $160 USD. The phone arrive in perfect condition WITH a phone charger within a few days. I am lifelong Motorola user for my personal phone and have a newish S23 for work. At the USD price of this phone, the A15 4G really does blow away competitor 4G phones at this price range, but I was a bit nervous about leaving my 100% reliable, but super clunky Moto behind.There are a lot of excellent online reviews for the A15 4G/5G, but some of highlights of this international version include full 1080 HD OLED display (which is great), 6 GB of ram (most are 4 GB at this $ range), NFC for financial transactions (less common in sub $200 phones), and the promised extended  support for Android updates / security patches. The 4G is also dual sim, but you have to make a choice with the second slot - either a second sim card OR an SD card for more memory.  Whatever version of the A15 4G/5G phone you purchase, read the phones specs carefully. There are a lot of common features between the various versions of these phones, but differences appear to occur. For instance, the 5G A15 is single sim and Samsung states NFC is region specific. The official version of this phone in Canada only has 4GB of ram at this time.So far this phone has worked extremely well, and it is a user experience that approximates my work S23. You are not going to get a great game experience, world shattering photos or film your YouTube  content with this phone, but it is great for standard phone activities.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase!

It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice.

The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal.

I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alejandra', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Dude y tarde un poco en decidir hacer la compra sin embargo al día de hoy estoy muy satisfecha con mi compra, la pila al 94 y sin detalles.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Javier Serapio', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'La verdad estoy muy satisfecho con la compra, me llego sin ningun rasguño, por parte de la paqueteria venia abierto un poco abierto de un lado así que grabé frente a ellos cuando lo abrí y ya dentro venia el paquete del celular bien sellado.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* \U0001fae2 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dona', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people.  I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it.  It is on a carrier that is not one of the ""big names"".  It suits my purposes fine.My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe.  This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there.  Believe me, I tried.  The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone.  I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering.  I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating.  They did not disappoint!The first phone I purchased was purple.  It arrived in excellent condition visually.  No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone.  It charged up to 82% which was great.  Everything was wonderful.  Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user).  I couldn\'t hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion.  Nope, wasn\'t me.MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone.  They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me.  The replacement phone was blue, but that isn\'t an issue.  It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new.  It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a ""new"" phone and to do your research on sellers.

This one was not!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I\'ve ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I\'ve bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it\'s a renewed phone, it\'s not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it\'s now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I\'ve been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I\'ve always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that\'s a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don\'t know what to do.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'T J', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'ALMOST NEW', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024', 'Review Body': 'When I received this phone, there was a small scratch on the front near the top corner.

It's very human sounding and works better than any other call screen service I have ever used.****IMPORTANT NOTE****  Asurion is a scam.  In my experience, If you ever have to file a claim they will make the process as difficult as possible.  When you sign in to the app to file a claim you have to sign in three separate times.  The form they want you to fill out does not self-populate your name, address, phone # etc.  You’ll then need to enter various other information, and they want a pic of both the front and back of your driver’s license (remember, you logged in with a UN and PW).  Once you upload all of this, they tell you it will take 24 business hours to review.  First, they reject the form stating you must print and sign the form even though it says you can sign electronically.  If you call their number, they will place your call on hold for a while and initially an automated message will attempt to tie up your call having you answer various questions.  Eventually someone in a foreign country will answer your call.  The initial person will try to sell you additional services and after you say no a couple times, they will transfer you to someone else.  You guessed it, you will have to be on hold again.  You will get transferred and placed on hold several more times and they will find a way to deny your claim.  What is especially frustrating is you have followed all their directions along the way.  They can (and will) raise service fees without any notice.  In the end, you will not save any money and have spent far too much time submitting forms and talking to people that lie and misdirect you every step of the way.  The company’s employees are dishonest and have no problem lying to you.  You can give it a try if you want but you have been warned.  Instead of paying their monthly fee dump the money in a savings account.  Odds are you’ll be able to buy a new product that’s updated, and you will receive it in a couple of days instead of weeks later.

On top of being a great camera, any imperfections in photos are fixed by Google's AI software.2: Amazing screen brightness & quality. The new OLED screen resolution and quality overall is one of the best I've seen in androids, definitely up there with the newest Galaxy S models. It can get very bright when you need it to and very dark.3: The design/durability. Google is well known for their unique phone designs, and the Pixel 8 is no exception. Anybody looking at the phone will know it's a Pixel. The back is also scratch resistant and can handle major falls. An added plus on top of its 7 year software updates!Where it falls short:1: It's G3 Tensor chip. Google has recently started developing their own phone chips, and the processing power in the G3 is good for a $600 phone. However, it unfortunately falls short of other flagship Samsung or Apple phones. It also tends to heat up a bit, but that's an added plus in winter time :)2: It's battery life. The battery is decent, lasting about 7 - 8 hours of heavy use, but is again outraced by Samsung.Overall, the phone is perfect in its camera quality, durability/design, and new OLED screen.

Then I switched to iPhone an SE and 12 Mini. I came back to android and got this one. This phone is super fast, the screen is very nice and the battery can last 2 days of light use. I do food delivery and can get a full day of hard use on it with a bit to spare. I carry my charger with me and it charges up to 100 in 30 minutes! I recommend this phone to anyone who loves android and clean software. I am a student on a budget and this phone surpassed my expectations. My only gripe is the software can (rarely) be a little buggy but that\'s few and far in between. I plan to have this phone for years. Works great with Visible by Verizon.Pros:•Great value for the price!•Amazing battery life•Extremely fast charging•Accurate and fast fingerprint sensor•Great speakers•Amazing screen•Great cameras (not as good as some other flagships, but definitely good)•Fast (the Gen 2 Snapdragon is almost too overpowered and efficient, great for emulation like PS2, 3DS, Switch)•Stays cool (has a dedicated cooling system)•Clean software•Fast Bluetooth connectivity•NFC•8GB RAM + more from system storage if needed•Premium build quality•2 year limited warranty with optional extended warrantiesCons:•Only 3 years of android updates, 4 years of security updates (compared to Apple and Samsung, it\'s on the shorter side)•Sometimes a lil buggy (not often, but worth mentioning)•Face Unlock doesn\'t work well (I don\'t use it anyways)•128GB storage gets taken up by system storage and ""other"" files\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'GuessMe', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Performance and Value – 5 Stars!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The OnePlus 12R is an outstanding smartphone that delivers on all fronts.

Then you can go back and ""enable"" the Google app again.If the Google page then comes back, as it did on my phone, repeat that process but then go back into Settings, go to ""Home Screen and Lock Screen"", then select "" Lock Home Screen layout"". That prevents any changes to the home screen and should get rid of the Google page for good.But that\'s the only thing about this phone I\'ve disliked.

For $400 dollars its arguably the best cost to performance I've had for a phone ever since I started using android around the oneplus 3t and LG V10 era. I use it 95% of the time for media consumption. Reading, watching videos, listening to music. Audio as well is exceptional due to Dolby speakers. They sound great. Love the phone.

First week with it, the only thing I can stress is remember the R when purchasing accessories.  I don't recall if I picked the case due to it being suggested or if I found a case separately.  What I can say is the case I have doesn't cover the cameras as well as it would, and the power button doesn't sit well in the fitting on the case.  I reviewed my orders and saw the case was for a OnePlus 12 and not a OnePlus 12R.  That being said, it was probably my fault and I ordered a new 12R case and will eat the loss on the first case.  Not a big deal.  Battery drains significantly faster than my previous phone, but it was a powerhouse (Ulefone Power Armor 18T), so my basis for comparison is quite a bit larger/longer lasting.  The processing power and speed is way up from the Ulefone though.  Ultimately happy with my purchase.  This phone is wafer thin and insanely light compared to the Ulefone as well.

UNLOCKED, one issue called a network unlock code, read review!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I took photos of the phone the day of arrival but now cant find them.. but the phone came in EXCELLENT condition although the packaging was just a box with little to ensure a safe delivery. The phone was unlocked but a **NETWORK UNLOCK CODE** kept popping up when sim card was insterted. (Thats the photo in this review.) So I swore the phone wasnt unlocked. Reached out to the seller and my carrier which was walmart family mobile. I was told by my carrier i needed a new sim card. So i ordered it and when it finally arrived,  boom same error. My carrier reset the sim many times and still no luck. When i had messaged the seller they gave me a code that wasnt right and when i reached out again, still another wrong code. What the phone fails to warn you is that only after a few attempts it will lock you out completely. It will then say **MASTER KEY CODE** needed. I googled what that was and it seemed like a hopeless code to obtain. The startup on the phone says AT & T. So i took it to their store and they had said that yes the phone was unlocked!! But the network was locked to walmart family mobilewhich was my carrier . So come to find out the code i needed, the first code, the network unlock code, I needed from my carrier!  They absolutely missed it and after days of this mess and ongoing phone calls, finally the walmart family mobile agent on that day in the At&T store had told me the codes i needed from day one. Idk how they just skipped the option and blamed my sim card. The codes arent a secret and im still unsure why they didnt recommend theirs to fix it. I guess they just assumed it wasnt their codes needed. But it was!!! Unbelievable right!! So then were now stuck on master key code and no one, my carrier, nor AT&T, nor samsung can help with that. Due to the sellers wrong codes, me googling the wrong codes, and most of all my carriers support line not mentioning their codes, I was locked out and was gonna return the phone. However AT&T did show me other sim cards put into the phone by other carriers were working. It was still unlocked but just couldnt now be used on family mobile and possibly all tracphone carriers due to the master key code lock. So with that said I swapped to AT&T prepaid and got their sim card and it all worked great! It was recommended to get the sim card from the AT&T store directly because sometimes those sim kits at walmart dont always work correctly and are nonrefundable. So if this issue happens to you just be sure to ask your carrier for those network codes!! The seller now knows what to suggest if this happens to another and I'm telling you that the carrier has the codes and all will be fine. Also the seller offered me a replacement phone  and partial refund for this issue. I declined a replacement only because I couldnt send this phone back and await a new one. I was already without a phone long enough dealing with this for days. So the seller at least still gave me a partial refund and that was okay with me. So the customer service is well and fair from them!!! Also even AT&T said the phone itself was in such great shape! So far so good on the phone itself, everything is working as it should.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Auricom', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Should Have Purchased One Sooner', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'After nearly four years with my Samsung A10e, I decided it was time for an upgrade. My criteria were specific: I wanted a more recent, used Samsung phone that was unlocked, had ample storage, and most importantly, featured a microSD slot for my extensive music library. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G in Cloud Red ticked all these boxes and more.Transitioning from the A10e, the performance leap to the S20 FE was immediately noticeable. Everything from navigating the UI to streaming content on YouTube and multitasking feels incredibly responsive. This phone has transformed my user experience, offering a significant improvement in speed and efficiency.Despite being a renewed device, the quality of the S20 FE pleasantly surprised me. It arrived with minor marks on the sides, but these were hardly a concern given the excellent condition of the screen and the overall functionality of the phone. I\'ve always been particular about battery health, so I appreciated the ""Protect Battery"" feature, which I also used on my A10e. The battery performance has been exceptional, supporting my heavy music streaming habits without a hitch.The larger display is a game-changer. The vibrant colors and increased screen real estate enhance everything from watching videos to browsing the web. I\'ve disabled certain features to extend battery life, but this hasn\'t detracted from my overall experience with the phone.One of the reasons I opted for an unlocked phone was the flexibility it offers. While I primarily use the S20 FE for media consumption, it\'s reassuring to know it can serve as a reliable backup for calls and texts if needed. The phone\'s build quality and care in its refurbishment are evident, making it a solid investment for anyone in the market for a high-quality, used smartphone.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect blend of performance, quality, and value, making it an excellent choice for Samsung enthusiasts and anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience without the flagship price tag.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sandra Sandoval', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llevo en tiempo y forma y ridículo ja funcionado de maravilla, tenía miedo de que algo fallará pero no ha sido el caso.

I am impressed.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I\'m someone who isn\'t picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I\'d honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn\'t so hard to get by in today\'s day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I\'m not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn\'t obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don\'t know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I\'m sure it isn\'t the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don\'t worry, I clear them when I\'m done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it\'s pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I\'ve seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality. Not sure what you\'d get out of the more expensive ones, but I\'m more than happy with what I\'ve got here.TL;DR: if you ""just need a phone that works,"" get this one!

I was looking for something that wasn\'t one of the mainstream brands like Samsung, Apple, etc. I like the features (decent storage, can use external storage, large screen, comes unlocked, good battery life with quick charging, various widgets, so many settings, and more) and the lack of ""bloatware"" that comes with the phone.There are 2 things that I don\'t like about the phone compared to my last one (Google Pixel 3).1, that I was aware of from other reviews, is the camera is not the best. Sometime you need some really good light for the picture to come out decent, otherwise pictures can be rather dark. I find myself editing them often to brighten them up. That and it lacks the crispness that you can get with phones like the Google Pixel and others. Besides that, it has some cool camera options, like professional mode (which if I learned how to use that I\'m sure my images would come out a bit brighter), macro, others, and some of the editing tools are pretty cool.And 2, something that bugs me enough to note it here, is the responsiveness of the screen. I don\'t think it is an app issue as it has happened with multiple apps, but sometimes while swiping in a direction, it doesn\'t always respond the way I want it to. For example, I use Spotify very frequently, and it\'s where I get annoyed at this issue the most. In Spotify, when you are viewing a song you can swipe from right to left to change a song, or swipe down to get out of the song view, taking you back to a menu screen. So many times, it does not register my swipe to the left, instead it registers it as a downswipe, exiting the screen I was on.

Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. It's not as fast as back fingerprint readers but I can't blame oneplus as android a whole has moved towards using in-display finger readers.

Dah', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Replacing a failing Pixel 3XL, this has done the job quite well, but...there are some quibbles.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2021', 'Review Body': ""Full disclosure I enjoy the more pure Android eco-system. Having read about One Plus Oxygen being an open source port of Android that gets pretty good reviews I decided to go for the One Plus 9 5G. My carrier is Google Fi, and I was so disappointed they started selling Samsung phones, of which I'm not a fan at all.First thing I noticed after purchasing it was the fit and finish is quite nice. It's not a brick, not svelte per se, but it has a good weight to it. The width was a welcome change from the Pixel 3XL. That minor reduction in width made this much more capable as a single hand phone. I'm not one to really care about fingerprints but you will get fingerprints all over the back and the face...again, whatevs.The speed. Out of the gate, when I dropped my Google Fi sim into the device the first thing I noticed was the speed. This is a fast tight phone. Which I do appreciate. Especially since my Pixel was on it's last legs and I really did need a replacement that would be a decent upgrade.If you purchase the unlocked version you should be aware of a few settings so your coverage is taking advantage of both WiFi calling/data, and roaming. Which sort of leads me to believe that since you have to make those adjustments in the settings menu. I wonder how many people have purchased the phone and thought, damn my coverage is awful with this thing.  So, I ding them for that....but then, this isn't a on and done purchase. You have to do a bit of finagling with the hardware. Welcome to Android....lol.Charging. WOW...just WOW. I have a 15w wireless charger I used with my Pixel and it charges the One Plus 9 5G...just fine....and...not sure I get why people complain about the wireless charging but in my experience it's just fine. At work I charge it connected to a docking station and.....it's FAST. And that's using my Pixel charging cable.Battery life. I don't think this is intended as a battery sipper. it will go through a full charge in a day. With some room to spare. But overall I wasn't dismayed by the battery life. I've tested it with the various and NUMEROUS battery life extension settings on the phone, some of which are confusing...again...welcome to Android. But I like playing around with stuff like this;Camera. Love it. It's great. I've literally taken shots with my Pixel that I regard as stunning. And in the few weeks I've had the One Plus 9 5G, can't complain at all. If anything, I've noticed a depth of color in both wide  and closer shots that feels more realistic and to be honest I'm kind of shocked at how well the camera works compared to the Pixel 3XL, which...I really loved that camera, a lot. The interface is quite different but it's responsive and the level of tweeking you can do to get your shot is miles apart from the Pixel.What's not so great: Well, on the second week I scratched the screen, Just above the fingerprint sensor. I had it in my pocket with some keys, my bad, and I was kind of surprised it scratched so easily. I've had my Pixel for over 3 years, handling the exact same way and I never experienced that. The screen never had any wear at all. The scratch isn't bad, you can only see it if you look at it at an angle. But still. This concerns me.Fingerprint sensor: hit or miss. It's built into the front of the screen, which is nice. But, it takes multiple tries to unlock, and if your fingers are particularly dry, or just off from the sensor. Yes, you'll get a warning and have to enter your pin after so many tries. To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. But it has been an annoyance a few times.Choices!: There's a LOT to play with in the settings, for me not a big deal at all, for others....gives me pause. Not sure I'd recommend this phone to someone not into having fun with the settings. Or a person that just wants to turn it on a go.File transfers to Mac: It'd be nice if I could connect the phone to my mac to transfer files. The phone automatically offers a USB driver to install when you connect it to a PC. Not so much with a Mac. There was an article on the One Plus website about enabling developer mode so you could enable USB logging so you could do file transfers....tried it, didn't work. Not a deal breaker but.....again, not the most user friendly experience.Conclusion: I like the phone, and I think it'll serve me for what I need it to do. Speed, durability and camera. 5G coverage where I'm at is, spotty, but, have noticed a speed boost when it does show up in the top menu bar...which again...wow, LOADS of icons in the top home screen menu bar...it's kinda funny. And Camera, I used my camera phone on my Pixel all the time. If this phone's camera was lackluster or a compromise I would have sent it back fast.  But from what I've experienced, especially the camera interface, I have a lot to play with and for that I'm excited.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Exelente entrega', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Exelente', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Muy buena entrega\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alexandra Racine', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on October 12, 2023', 'Review Body': ""Pour un Oneplus 9 neuf à 440 $ , le rapport qualité-prix est excellent.Il est rapide et j'aime la détection du visage.

From the moment I started using this device, it was clear that Samsung has truly outdone itself with this model. The 256GB of storage is more than ample for all my apps, photos, and videos, and the performance is lightning fast thanks to the latest AI technology and powerful processing.The display is simply stunning—vivid colors, sharp details, and deep blacks make everything from streaming videos to scrolling through social media a visually immersive experience. The build quality is top-notch, and the design is sleek and premium, giving it a luxurious feel in the hand.One of the standout features for me is the advanced camera system. The images are incredibly detailed, even in low-light conditions, and the array of shooting modes allows for creative flexibility. The battery life is impressive as well, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use without a hitch.Being unlocked and Android-based means I have full control over my device and can switch carriers or customize settings without hassle. The software experience is smooth, with Samsung’s enhancements adding value without overwhelming the core Android experience.Overall, the SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a high-performance, feature-packed smartphone. It’s reliable, powerful, and offers an exceptional user experience. Highly recommended!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Cher', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best photo phone ever.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I love my phone.

I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Carolina R.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Me encantó.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kelly Lienemann', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Value for an Unlocked iPhone XR Despite Minor Wear', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device\'s performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body.

The RF performance of this phone seems to allow it to get a workable signal where other phones do not.  I was often in areas which seemed to have no to marginal coverage.  Now with this phone they all seem workable.  Casually comparing its performance to other kinds of phones in use in the same area by others on various networks, this phone will typically be able to make calls when others cannot.  It is clearly better than the phone it replaced.  Perhaps it is realted to Motorola being an old line radio company.  Who knows.  But it is a superior RF performer.I tested using different SIM cards and it works with both Verizon and T-Mobile (a GSM carrier) networks.  This is pretty unusual because most phones are either Verizon or GSM but not both.  The phone is advertised as working with ALL US carriers and this seems to be a good claim.  Maybe the thing is an SDR?  Wouldn\'t that be nice.The wifi section has both 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands.  Both work very well.  Using a directional beam as the access point I was able to get a workable 2.4 link at about a half mile.  If you want to play with this I used a Ubiquiti Powerbeam PBE M2 400 which you can get on Amazon.The phone is also very stable, having not yet crashed after a few months of use.

There are no hangs or crashes.The memory holds all the apps I need and is only about 60% used.  Battery life can go way past two days if you are just on standby and have all the saver features turned on.  The two days is with ""normal"" use as in my kind of normal use versus playing games or watching video all day.  Charging is quite fast and considering you can run a day with far less than 100% battery, the time to refresh the battery is quite quick.The camera is average, which in my case is good enough, but keep in mind it\'s a cell phone.  If you want to do real photography get a DSLR.For the money you will not find a better deal.  There is no way I would pay $1200 for a phone especially when I can get 90% of the way there for 5% of the cost.Mot has really done a great job.  I hope they keep up the great work because we need solid, good performing phones at this cost level.If you want a phone that just works and does so very well and don\'t care about fashion, get this.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'camaraderie', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Value and Performs Well', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I got this one for the family to replace a basic flip phone. I use the POWER version of this phone myself and had confidence that it would be a good upgrade from a basic as a first smart phone.It is an EXCELLENT choice as the screen is large and you can configure everything so as not to be too confusing for a non tecchie. The phone call performance is excellent with good sound quality in both directions. This is NOT the fastest phone or one that has a lot of storage or memory...but I knew that going in and I can always add a big microSD if she ever needs more than is included as there is a single slot for one right next to the sim card in the pop out drawer,This one worked perfectly moving the Sim Card from a T Moble account phone and because the PRIOR phone was a BASIC phone...the numbers/contacts did NOT move over or download by themselves as they WILL if you are moving from a smart phone. I had to first EXPORT the contacts to the BASIC phone SIM card before moving the card to the new Moto Pur. Lots of easy videos on this 2 minute job on line.Once I did that...all was well after allowing some time to load up, We got a nice leatherette billfold type case for this and we have a happy family member. I really don't think there is a better smart phone in this price range and the camera is WAY better than you might think...I think they measure the single lens rather than adding up all separate lenses...NOT the STATE of the ART camera in a $1k phone but Really nice quality at 1/10th the price! If you want more power and storage and camera...get the power version for 100 bucks more...but in the meantime...if you're needs and your budget are not as great...the Pur is an excellent choice.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Francisco Cruz', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 9, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llegó bien empacado y antes de lo estimado, lo quería como regalo para un familiar y quedó encantado; funcionando correctamente hasta ahora\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Item arrived within schedule and buyer is fully satisfied with it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Shawn Mills', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 4, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This product when I purchased it was described as new and unlocked.

I saw it was shipped on the 25th. On the 30th, I received an SMS from DHL saying they planned delivery on Oct. 3rd, but on the same day I got an email asking for copy of national ID and content description for clearing customs. I am not a Morocco residents nor citizen, so I sent my foreign passport instead. On the 3rd, Amazon tracking info said clearing custom was delayed as additional documents were needed. So I called DHL, and the rep said it would be delivered on the 4th instead. On the 4th, I saw a newly posted message about delay on Amazon tracking. I called DHL various times but couldn\'t get to anyone. I then sent an inquiry by email and get a response shortly saying it was being taking care of. Then late afternoon, I got the package.Upon arriving, the seal of the packing had an opening large enough to put in a hand but not for getting the phone out, so I didn\'t complain.Unpacked, the inner packing of the phone was in excellent condition, very much like the original packing but had no Samsung marking, rather, it had a marking of ""amazonrenewed"". There was a film covering the screen, like on a new phone. The phone appeared in excellent condition, only had a small scratch at the back when I looked in detail, and a hair of scratch on the screen that is only visible under bright light and in a particular angle. I tried but couldn\'t turn on the phone - there was no response. The box also included a USB-C cable and a cheap non-Samsung charger made in China. I used my own Samsung Charger to charge the phone. After plugged in, it showed the battery was at 0. So I let it charge to full.After started, it turned out fully unlocked. My Morocco sim card works with 4G. The phone\'s software looked already reset, but I reset it myself anyhow. Then updated to the latest system with Android 12, and loaded many apps I need. During about the first week, the battery appeared quite poor. With medium usage it lasted about a day. I tried all necessary settings to conserve battery, but it didn\'t seem to help much. These couple days, it becomes much better, lasting about 45 hours. I read it was likely due to some AI processes either from Android 12 or Samsung doing the learning work at first.\xa0 But it\'s pretty bad the phone doesn\'t show any info.I would say I am very happy with the phone. And this is after having a terrible experience in the past with Samsung.The last Samsung phone I had was S7 Edge bought in Thailand (I am a traveler), new at a Samsung store for perhaps ~$800. I actually wanted the normal S7 (without the ""edge""), but it was out of stock then. I never liked the ""edge"", it was a silly design in my mind. The phone worked well initially, but in the coming couple of years I had a terrible experience. About 5 months later when I was in Vietnam, the screen started to show shaded bands across. As I was wondering how or if I should return to Thailand to get the phone serviced, the bands disappeared after a month. Then about another 7 months later when I was in Azerbaijan, the phone couldn\'t start after I did a system update. So I couldn\'t use the phone for a couple weeks until I reached Tbilisi in Georgia\xa0 when I had someone flashed it.\xa0 About a year later, it died on me again when I was in Morocco. I had someone re-flashed it, but it was not successful.\xa0 About 1 month later I reached the city of Fes where there is a Samsung service center.\xa0 After checking, they said there was something wrong with the motherboard. Very shocking!\xa0 I\'ve never had such problem in my life with all the phones and computers, cheap or dear, and this was a flagship!\xa0 So eventually, I sold it to a local repair shop for $200, for which they said they only needed the screen. That was end of 2017.So I never bought a Samsung again, and would definitely not buy one at the full price. I admit the S series is not worthless.\xa0 At least, I like the camera.\xa0 But I never had a chance to buy one at a largely reduced price (I won\'t buy from just any second-hand sellers).So now, the Amazon reviewed phone with some warranty got me interested. Yes, I have some risk, but to me with the past experience, the risk is not much higher than getting a new phone from Samsung, plus, I am putting in a much lower bet now.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jeff P', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Phone was is great condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Ordered this phone from Amazon around 5pm on Friday, and arrived at 8:00am the following day.

They  ended up being very very  helping in tracking down the seller as I always try to find a solution with them first before I call Amazon.  So, moving forward, basically I received what would be  at best, a fair to acceptable device . It has pits and grooves all along the bezels , a huge scratch on the back from the middle to the edge of the device. The screen was not great either , it came with a film type screen protector which I found strange as I purchase many devices and felt I should take it off to have a look and inspect. While the screen was not great it was also  not working properly via the amoled screen/digitizer recognizing fingerprints or gestures at times , maybe it was just the optical fingerprint sensor malfunctioning , actually I believe it’s digital sensor  on the s21 , regardless that’s nor here or there, the lint is , it didn’t work and was buggy  when touching all around NOT due to the OS (updated it to android 13 UI 5.1 it came on 11) (operating system ) but the hardware. Not being updates is not big deal as I prefer the option so that was done right at least.  However, I wish I had taken a picture of the back of the device as admittedly at this point I was disappointed and in the moment of “wth” moment because it took me 30 minutes to clean the device properly peel the stickers off and glue all over to truly inspect the device which I already knew it was going back as it’s not excellent and they will definitely get it back much cleaner than I received it but , again it device is beat up. They fact it wasnt even cleaned and  had sticker residue all over the the device as well or some sort of glue, was the first big indicator. They did not replaces the battery as well and it was not refurbished, I work in IT and other areas of tech like OSINT , basically hardware and software areas , not only by Amazon’s standards but in general, it’s common knowledge and states when purchasing , a “excellent “ condition device should have 90% battery health or above , this device had 74% battery health below 80% is unacceptable even for the cheapest condition you can buy as you’ll need a battery replacement within the 1st 6 months most likely sooner .  It gets worse as I contacted chubbiestech and got zero help or care for that matter ,  they said call Amazon it’s on them for the most part. I am making that short as ot was jet her a automated reply or a very I dont care approach on customer service.  I also reached out a second time to make them aware that about the battery percent being at 74% for the next person as a professional courtesy to get a  copy and pasted same response. So , very contradictory when if it’s sold by then and refurbed by them but are telling me it was handled by Amazon. I have the screenshots of the lack of concern or help and it’s just disappointing. As of now as I feel this brings up a issue that is indicative of the way things are now which is , the whole situation is a mess, as I made the return properly , bought insurance and did things accordingly , SO come to find out as of today the 18th of November, UPS has lost the package , Amazon can’t process my refund manually for another 2 weeks until the ticket expires , which is outrageous as this should not  be on me , my responsibility is done in the matter,  it’s was returned and I paid extra for insurance to make sure it’s safe, and I am eating the cost due to bad business practices on chubbieatech part as I am a small business myself, and I hate to say this but time is money , this will cost me in the end regardless of what happens , all due to not getting what I paid for from the start , I am in shock that in this day & age finding proper solutions and proper business practices has become so hard. If I would have gotten the excellent condition device that I had no problem paying for and they had no problem taking the money , I shouldn’t be without a device and up the creek as no one wants to step in and take accountability. I’m sorry , sellers like this that slip through the cracks and shouldn’t be in the platform, Amazon is not eBay. Now it’s my headache and it is very frustrating. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay clear from this one because if your device is not  not up to par, good luck as you will not get help , I’m a week in and I’m out of money spent and a device . I should also mention the charging port had a lip around the oval port indicating it’s been dropped , which is fine however replace the parts and check the device , make sure it works and indeed in excellent REFURBISHED condition. Nothing on this device was cleaned or fixed and was a poor device . I truly hope Amazon doesn’t sensor my review , which I have a feeling they will because this is the real life experiences that occur when you don’t get what you pay for and trust the Amazon name and sellers under them , and here I am with no device or refund of my money. It’s not ok , there is no A-Z guarantee here . Everyone has passed the buck. This is a HONEST review along with the consequences of poor business practices I think people should know about if you chose to buy from here and should not be censored.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'AmazonCustomer2013', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very good, but not excellent condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone came nicely packaged in an Amazon renewed box with a usb C cable, non OEM charger and sim removal tool.

El zoom es x30 e increíble. El teléfono ya se actualizo a Android 13. La conectivad wifi6 es super rápida y estable. La conectividad 5G a este precio es súper favorable, espero conservar este equipo varios años. Y tienes la posibilidad de agregar una tarjeta micro SD para almacenamiento externo. También está liberado para Mexico, sin problenas de redes. Y tiene la posibilidad de usar ""e-sim"". Gran tecnología a un gran precio. Gracias al proveedor !!!Update: Lamentablemente el lector de huella dactilar fallo despues de unas semanas de uso diario. Estoy aplicando el reembolso por devolucion. Es la primera vez que me falla algo ""renewed"", espero la garantia de Amazon pueda resolver este problema. En lineas generales, pensaria en volver a comprar este telefono.

For every feature most of the big players add to their increasingly large pseudo-tablets, something you liked goes away forever, for seemingly no reason at all. Headphone jacks? Sorry, not cool enough! Expandable storage? You mean ""Google Drive""? It is an absolute clown fiesta out here, and frankly I\'m sick of it. Luckily, apparently Motorola is, too.To start with the obvious, this phone has both a headphone jack and a slot for a microSD card, so on top of the 256 gb of internal storage you can put pretty much however much you could ever need in it for your pictures, music, and everything else -- because being forced to pay extra money for dodgy cloud storage so that you can access it less reliably is a scam, and everyone knows it. But Motorola didn\'t stop there, and so this blast from the past comes with a stylus, too. It isn\'t a ""smart"" stylus like the Samsung S24 Ultra, but who cares? It\'s a phone, not a Wacom tablet, even if the S24 is steadily approaching the size of one anyways. You can quickly jot down notes, use it to press those tiny little buttons in badly designed apps, or just play Professor Layton and the Curious Village HD the way god intended. It snaps in with a nice little click, so it doesn\'t feel like it\'s going to slip out like the old styluses used to, and while it never feels like a killer feature it\'s just one more nice little thing to have, because this is a phone made by people who understand that if you\'re paying a few hundred dollars for a device it should have more nice little things, and not less. But you know what it doesn\'t have? A stupid, annoying little bixby button that you have to beat your phone in arena combat to change to something more useful. Your move, Samsung.And while I\'m not normally picky about the appearance of my phone in favor of what it can do, I do have to say that the faux leather back was cooler than I expected it to be. It doesn\'t feel or look anything like real leather, but it\'s enough that it feels different from the usual boring metal or plastic slabs, and as far as design gimmicks go I did think it\'s pretty neat. The screen itself is also about as nice as my untrained eye can tell, and while it\'s not the strongest powerhouse you can buy (obviously, considering it costs anywhere from 1/2 to 1/3 what the current other flagship phones cost) it still capably runs modern 3D phone games at medium-range settings. If you\'re looking for the best of the best then you should look elsewhere, but it\'s hard for me to really find explicit faults with it.Except for one, unfortunately, which is that in the end I found that Verizon does not actually support this phone, because much like the phone manufacturers themselves most American service carriers operate on the principle of taking one step forward and two steps back every year. I have an S24 Ultra now, a misguided attempt to bury the loss of my SD card slot with opulent overspending and a fancier, if perhaps not better clicky stylus, but I\'ll cherish the day and a half I spent living in blissful ignorance thinking that the reason my SIM card wasn\'t working was just because of Verizon\'s mediocre service. Maybe I should just switch to AT&T, instead. The world is cruel enough as it is -- don\'t let your smart phone take things from you, too.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'K&J', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Insane Value w/Surprising Performance', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bought this to replace a OnePlus 10 Pro as I was tired of the quirky os and battery drain.  Had previously used LG phones and had missed the sim card and audio Aux out. Was interested to see that this had both, as well as a stylus.Got it for $250 on Prime Day and my biggest fear going from a Snapdragon 8 gen 1 to a 6 gen 1 was performance. I've been more than pleasantly surprised. In fact, when using Spotify and other apps that require a fast scan down the page I've actually found it faster. Was also happy to see just how sharp the red version looks. I put it under a clear case and love the way it looks.The camera app is certainly a weak point as it really does give extra color to images, and can take a split second longer to take a photo than a premium S22/iPhone, but its fine for my limited use.The battery has been the star of the show. Minus the relatively slow charge vs OnePlus's 60W charging, it's been amazing. Getting two days of battery life has been insanely refreshing.In second place for my favorite design angles, only by tiny bit, is the screen, which seemed to have a better white balance than the OnePlus 10 Pro. It's beautiful. It's also been very crisp and responsive, with the touchscreen always hitting the exact spot I touch (an issue I had on the OnePlus).Overall, for $250 (!) or even $400, this is a tremendous value. I don't game or do much video processing, so I can't speak to that...but for me, minus the camera speed, this daily drives very close to the flagship phones of my past. Add to that an audio Aux jack and the ability to add additional SD storage and it's a no brainier for most non power users (IMO). If you're not a power user and are looking to save cash on a solid phone, I'd say go for it. So far (2 weeks in), I couldn't be happier with my choice.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'NG.', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Not impressed..battery life is worse that my old moto e5 plus!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""How can a new phone have battery life worse than an old phone!!(went from 68% to 58% just on a whatsapp video chat!!)why is that even a thing!why is that allowed!new tech should be better not worse!!weird lag when using the video or photo app....horrible bottom facing speaker that you can feel vibrating when you're talking to someone..screen is really bad in sunlight too,think im done with Motorola after this one..not a happy customer.\nRead more""}]",,120 Hz,Moto G Stylus 5G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused).I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences):1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this.2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with).3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed).4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine.5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired.6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app).7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it.I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review.OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come! A great buy overall!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Terra sillings', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Better than I thought', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I was very nervous about ordering a phone from Amazon.

Turns out the battery was not plugged in properly and I had to plug it in properly by opening the phone. The s pen also doesn't work and I'm pretty sure it's fake. I had to update the phone multiple times because they never updated it. Overall I'd say 6/10, I'm not going to use the s pen and I'll probably buy a legit replacement on samsung for $50.

I\'d done the research and decided on the Galaxy S22 Ultra (mostly for the phone capabilities) but wasn\'t willing to spend $1200, so I took a chance on a refurb unit. I\'ve had it for a couple days now and I can say it was one of my better purchases.The phone arrived a day early, well packaged, and included the phone(w/37% battery charge), an adaptive fast charger, a cheap usb c charging cable, and sim removal tool. After close inspection, the phone showed no signs of prior ownership. It was in pristine condition just like new. It started right up and I got through the setup process. Being an unlocked phone,I figured I could just throw in my Cricket sim card and be ready to go. Cricket recognized the phone straight away, reminded me to turn on wireless calling, and I was back in business. Now let\'s get it charged up.I plugged in my OP6T usb c cable and powerpack out of habit and started messing with settings when I ran across the battery settings. It showed 2 hour, 13 minutes until fully charged. Ok, lets try the included charger and cable. I setup the included charging rig and the charging time was reduced to 42 minutes. Sweet!... until it wasn\'t. With the phone fully charged, I went to unplug the charger only to find it stuck in the phones usb port. No amount of wiggling in any direction would free it. Time to turn to Google for a solution. Not much help there other than someone suggesting sending the phone in for charging port replacement after suggesting the fast charger combined with a cheap cable may have allowed an arc to form in the port effectively ""welding"" the cable to the port. Panic set in as I resumed the wiggling process. I finally decided to pull harder and dislodge it, whatever the outcome. It came out finally. I plugged in my ""good"" cable and it showed ""charged"" so I knew it was working. I quickly disposed of the cheap usb cable so it could cause to more harm. Crisis averted.I can tell that the signal reception is much better than I had with my old phone. My old phone had good early morning reception where I work but it was shut down at 9:30 A.M. for the rest of the day. I was happy to see that was no longer the case with this phone. I had useable signal even inside the building. That in itself is huge to me.This a is a large phone. I work construction and wear carpenter jeans (with the pocket on the right leg) and all my previous phones slid right in that pocket with a slim case. This phone will barely fit naked. With the case I bought for it, it won\'t even begin to fit. Luckily the Unicorn Beetle Pro case has the belt clip so I can still carry it while at work... although I\'m not a fan of the belt clip method. The case is very protective but makes the phone even huge(er). I have a slim case on order.The phone itself is fast, responsive and beautiful with more bells and whistles than any phone I\'ve owned to date. It\'s going to take some time to start learning the tips and tricks that make this phone stand out from the crowd, otherwise it\'s a waste of this phones ""talent"". I\'m hoping my luck and the longevity of the phone will keep this as my daily driver for years to come as Samsung has promised four generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades.(tl:dr) It\'s a big glorious phone sent safely at a good price. IMO... if you can swing the price, don\'t hesitate.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Agustin', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llego bien, su estetica es casi perfecta, aunque me llego otro color de el que dice la publicacion, el unico ""detalle"" es que la tecla de volumen alto esta un poco dura al apretarla, vere si con el uso se afloja y si no regresare el producto.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alejandro', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'No me llego un ladrillo, llego un muy buen telefono!!

Zorach', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very Happy With This So Far: Great Phone for Great Price, But Some Key Downsides', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I\'ve been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it\'s a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.Things I like about this phone: it\'s relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It\'s great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don\'t like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can\'t make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It\'s a big downside because now I can\'t use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don\'t have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it\'s not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It\'s not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry. I refuse to pump big money into an industry that isn\'t representing my values and the things I care about in life.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jessie Asuncion', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Worked like a charm', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My last purchase on Amazon  with a refurbished phone, I got totally burned.

The Pixel outperforms the Huawei in terms of real-world processing speed, outside camera, and it comes with the the latest Android O.S.  The most enjoyable feature is the AI photo features such as Unblur and ability to remove items from a photo.Pros: Fast Performance.Decent storage, advanced photo editing features, high spec outside facing camera.Cons: heavy when compared to other phones.Does not come with a charger. (Huawei phone did that's why I can complain).No expandable storage (micro SD) option, but built-in 128gb should suffice for most.Does not have an alarm feature from shut off. (Huawei and other asian branded phones have this.  Eliminates the need for an alarm clock as you can shut the off the phone before bed and it will turn on and wake you at the alarm time in the morning.)Fingerprint reader is a bit inaccurate at times.Selfie camera is Ok quality.Bulky optional charger with ok battery life.Overall, it's a good phone if you can get it at the sale price of less than 400$.  The Camera quality and photo editing software make it an attractive phone that you'll have fun playing with.  Even with older photos.  But the weight and bulk are noticable, and has a long way to go in comparison to it's competitors at similar MSRP price points.If you need something now, then it's a definite buy.

The phone itself can get pretty hot.Guess it may be a new feature of mid-range phones, but not so great to have this warning when you're in the middle of a summer trip and have to worry about your only resource for Uber, taxis, hotel reservations, etc.Also, newer budget phones have started coming out at cheaper prices that have their own versions of AI photo editing and features comparable to this.All in all, if it's on sale and you don't plan to use it so much in the summer then it is still a good deal.But personally, this phone still has a ways to go.There are other budget phones out there now that  are comparable this one, lighter, and sell for a cheaper price.

So far it\'s very good, though I keep having to get used to how much bigger and heavier it is than my old one. Love the color. Much faster processing than my old one and much bigger battery life, but again, that\'s not hard, haha. So far no issues. Big screen is much easier to read on. I\'m still a bit thrown by how big all the app icons are and that you can\'t make them smaller to fit more on one page but that\'s whatever.***Update a few months in: I do wish the camera lenses on the back were integrated into a single flat panel and/or flush with the case like the S20 FE and other models, as it makes it harder to protect them and keep the surrounding area clean. I am always anxious about how I\'m storing my phone due to this (though certain cases may protect them better).With the weight of an added decenrly protective case, however, the phone can feel quite heavy after awhile and tire your wrists and fingers. The price of a nice big screen, I suppose.No overheating/cpu overload issues so far even with terribly coded apps like Spotify.Biggest con imo is the removal of the audio jack. I don\'t plan on getting wireless earbuds bc I don\'t want more batteries to deal with and I haven\'t bought usb-c earbuds yet so rn I\'m using a usb-c to audio jack adapter which is problematic for 2 reasons: 1) you can\'t charge it at the same time (though I\'ve seen split adapters that let you do this—not sure of their charge speed or audio quality though), and 2) at least with an adapter (not sure if ubiquitous connector issue), as it is a data connection rather than a simple 3mm jack, you can hear the ""fuzz"" (like an old record) of the data flow through the wire connection quite audibly at all times.

I love Galaxy products, but, I really created a lot more work for myself with this upgrade . Here\'s how:1. Every single video and most pictures need to be adjusted for contrast, vibrance, saturation and ambiance in my video editing software. My videos on my old phone were beautiful without having to do anything. The new phone, this model anyway, does not let you put my changes into the default settings for taking videos.  Without this, my videos all look washed out and horrible.2.  No mic jack meant I had to buy and learn to use a new mic system. I knew this up front, so not horrible, but still takes extra time and money.3.  No extra storage...using and finding my extra storage on the Note was not easy, but, on the new Galaxy  phones you can\'t upgrade your storage with a micro card. I knew this going in...but having to keep on top of this is another ""chore"" to keep the phone operating smoothly. Is 256g or even 512g enough storage for anybody in today\'s world? Just asking.4.

I see that they have increased the price now. It’s not flashy by any means, but for everyday use, it gets the job done.The battery life is the best I've got to say. It's the main reason I bought it. The 2-day battery holds up, and I don't often find myself connecting it to a charger. Even with moderate usage, like whether you are scrolling, texting, or doing some light gaming, it lasts the entire day and beyond.\xa0The 50MP camera is decent. In good lighting, photos come out satisfactory, but it struggles a bit in low light. I personally edit the photos later using the adjusting tool in the camera app; it makes it reasonably sharp and clear. The camera app is easy to use.\xa0The stylus is also a cool feature that I didn’t think I’d use much, but it’s actually handy for quick notes and drawing.Let's talk performance. It’s good for the price. It handles most tasks without too much lag. There are occasional slowdowns when switching between apps simultaneously when you are on a call; it becomes annoying, but it's not much of a deal breaker.The phone’s build is nice and big, and the color looks great. It feels comfortable in the hand, although it's a bit on the larger and heavier side. It becomes a little tricky when I don't have pants with bigger pockets. So keep that in mind if you prefer more compact phones.Overall, if you’re looking for a budget friendly phone that has reasonable performance, a good battery, and a few extra features like the stylus, the Moto G Stylus is a good choice. For $140, it’s hard to beat in this segment, but don’t expect it to perform like a high end phone.

Battery lasted well, speaker and camera were decent, and had some nice software features.The phone was great, for the first month, until I started to notice particular issues with it. It doesn\'t maintain a WiFi connection. It\'ll say that it\'s connected, but then pages won\'t load and it\'ll endlessly be buffering until I turned the WiFi off and suddenly it was a fast as lightning. I own numerous devices that connected to the same WiFi with absolutely no issues, and I even tried using different WiFi hotspots, but always had the same issue. I even tried configuring the phone settings to see if that would help, but it never did.What really bothered me about this phone though, was the fact that after a certain period of time after it was on (I\'m not sure exactly how long, but definitely less than 24 hours) suddenly the actual PHONE part of this ""smartphone"" would stop working. It would still be able to use data, and I was able to send /receive messages via social media, but I wouldn\'t be able to make/receive phone calls or texts. I\'d suddenly get a voicemail, while using my phone, stating that I missed a call when it didn\'t ring. And if I tried to make a call, the call would immediately end without ringing. The only way I figured out to resolve this (even after searching Google for more ways to configure the settings), was to restart the phone.Which brings me to my third issue. A small percentage of the time, it would restart in a normal, timely manner (1-2 minutes), but most of the time it would freeze on the startup screen for at least 5 minutes before finally loading in. Sometimes, if I held the power button and manually turned it off and back on, it would fix it, but not usually.My fourth issue, was that sometimes if I plugged it into the charger, it would suddenly restart. It didn\'t seem like too much of a big deal at the time, until one of the times that it happened, it froze ENTIRELY on the startup screen. I tried doing what I did previously to hopefully get it to start again, but it continued to freeze. After searching online for answers and trying to troubleshoot it, the only answer I was able to find... Was to manually factory reset it. I would have considered bringing it it somewhere to be looked at by a professional, but I didn\'t have the time or the money for that, especially since I was not at home and needed the phone ASAP. Doing this was an absolute last resort for me and I was devastated.Finally, what brought about the death of this phone, was that it\'s definitely not waterproof. I\'ll admit that this was entirely my fault, but I\'d like to mention this as a warning to those who are used to nearly indestructible water resistant phones (like the Samsung Galaxy series). It happened to be on the sink counter beside me while I was brushing my teeth and I accidentally knocked it into the water stream. The charging port ended up frying and it no longer charges. Being that I had so many issues with it though, I\'m thankful to have a reason to move on.Also, I\'d like to mention that if you\'re used to responsive pressure sensitive styluses (like the Galaxy Note series), the stylus for this phone is nothing like that. It\'s exactly like a stylus you\'d buy from the dollar store, except it looks nice and fits inside the phone.Another thing I\'d like to note, is that this phone is very heavy compared to other phones and kind of bulky. I like to use PopSockets, and I never had issues with them before, but while using this phone I had to replace the base about once a month because it would just start peeling off, due to the weight. I ended up having to super glue it to my phone case, which resolved the issue. It also hurt my hand quite a bit while holding it for any length of time.Despite all of these things, it did have numerous features that I liked, but they were software related, so I imagine they would probably be available on most Motorola phones. The battery also lasted a decent amount of time as well, about a day and a half as long as I didn\'t do too much gaming. The speaker was also nice and loud, but a little tinny at times. The camera was decent too, and I was able to take some nice pictures with it.The cons definitely outweigh any positives in my opinion.

My bf and I were very worried due to the mixed reviews. Although some of the reviews were bad I did not share the same experience.The box is secure with two white stickers on each side which is how the Google pixels are sold. When I took my phone out of the box it was in perfect mint condition and came with a USB c to USB cable. Beautiful and sexy design love the chrome detail on the camera.Charger: I did have to purchase a charging block for it. The battery was not charged so I charged it and it quickly came to 100 %. Battery lasts like a good day and a half and probably would last longer if I didn't use it so much.*** Now it did have a att card in there (like reviews stated) but I found out that an unlocked att phone that's brand new does look like that from att. ( Yes I physically called att to get to the bottom of this) The reps assured me that the seller has brand new unlocked att phones which are compatible with any carrier. Not dishonest seller like reviews had me assuming.Activation: My bf called our service provider Metro and the transfer to my phone was very fast. Took him 10 minutes and my phone was up and running. After I turned on and off my new phone like 2 times the phone was active.Functionality: I am very impressed with the speed of this phone. It's fast! If you like playing games or are like me and do everything from your phone this phone is great! Internet surfing, and multitasking is a breeze. So many free apps from note taking, games, reading, shopping, financial and more.Camera: This phone takes absolutely beautiful pictures. I even had no makeup and it looked decent not fuzzy or grainy or lack luster. When you tap the screen you can adjust contrast and brightness with out having to click edit separately. There are also really cool editing features I have not tried yet that look really cool.Still learning this  phone and the many features I haven't discovered.There are a lot of cool features like you can circle something on the screen at any time and it looks it up. Phone calls are written in words  on the screen for people who are hard of hearing during call. Very cool backgrounds during Google meet call very similar to face time features. I feel Google meet is a lot better than FaceTime (don't come for me lol). I am a previous iPhone user and there are some features of this phone that are simply better.Cost: This phone is a budget phone and still up to date with current updates and is a new phone. I refuse to spend a mortgage/rent payment on a phone. I just simply can't bc these phone prices are just insane for getting a current year phone. This one is last year's model + everything I wanted and more.Display: phone is very bright and the display is beautiful. Brightness can be adjusted bc it is a very bright phone which is great. Colors are vivid and clear making photo experience and gaming more fun.Sound: The sound is pretty loud. During calls I find myself lowering the volume. Whether you are using speaker phone or regular audio.Google users: if you do everything on Google and love the Google platform it intensifies your enjoyment. Everything transfers over and all your pictures and routine bc a breeze!I will update you all later on but at this point I couldn't say more good things ;) Just get it.** I am taking time to address all the negative feedback that almost deterred me from buying an amazing phone. I had the phone for three weeks and will be back with updates. Get yourself an OtterBox or something like it bc this phone has glass backing and if your like me than order it the same time you get the phone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tommy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Glad I Bought It-Great Phone So Far', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I've been with Verizon for years and always bought new phones through Verizon. This is my first unlocked phone purchase. I'm on a Verizon Family Plan and the plan for all lines was upgraded to a 5G Unlimited Data plan not long after 5G went live. I stuck with my 4G-LTE Moto Z2 Play until now when I pulled the trigger on this Google Pixel 7 Pro (512GB). The phone arrived at my door delivered by Amazon Prime next day. After I first turned on and set up the new Pixel 7 Pro I turned it off then I took the SIM card out of my old beat up Verizon Moto Z2 Play and I dropped it into the SIM slot of my new Google Pixel 7 Pro phone, turned the phone back on, and voilà! The phone immediately connected to 4G-LTE initially and I got frowny face, but about 3 minutes later it automatically switched and connected to 5G with 5 bars and I got big smiley face. It's been a solid 5G connection ever since. It was just that easy-peazy for me. The phone is snappy and responsive. Phone calls are crystal clear and sound amazing. The screen resolution and picture is fantastic. Super HD quality when watching 1080P or 4K. The speakers of the phone on speaker-phone sound fantastic, and the speakers sound fantastic even when listening to music or watching a video. The volume goes up very loud and it still sounds very good with little to no volume distortion (depending on the source audio). Bluetooth devices are pairing perfectly and without issues. So far, all the features of the phone work great. Security seems tight and the facial recognition and fingerprints work flawlessly thus far. The camera takes extremely good photos and video and even in very low light they come out very good. I'm trying to think of negatives and I can't really come up with any right now—except maybe that there are a whole heckuva lot of settings of all kinds that you can adjust, which isn't really a negative at all, but it takes a long time to get it all dialed in on an unfamiliar phone. Security options are many which is a good thing. I'm very happy I pulled the trigger on this so far and I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'verified purchase' negative reviews because this Google Pixel 7 Pro rocks. I'll come back and change my rating if that changes.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Panzergreni', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent Android Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Bigger than my previous Pixel 5, better camera, no spam apps - perfect phone for me.

My A25 freezes, opens and closes apps on its own, won't keep memory of last app and will restart the app. The screen is unresponsive A LOT. Sometimes the keyboard will not pop up. Other times I'll be typing and all my words get bunched up showing where the spell check words are, but not in any field on the screen. It's so frustrating. Sometimes I have to keep tapping the screen for it to be responsive. Other times it jumps from screen to screen. The battery life is okay, nothing stellar. Sound quality is decent, but I don't care much about that at this point. I have quality ear buds and BT speakers. I've been a Samsung consumer for decades. I've had a handful of awful Samsung phones including the ones Samsung would kill, (had two of the same model and they both died a day or two away from each other) like they were scheduled to be a brick. Took me a while to get good with Samsung again...and here I am. Again. Taking a screen shot is difficult because the power button is too sensitive and the - volume button is not.

It began lagging more and more. Storage was full and apps wouldn\'t update because there supposedly wasn\'t enough space, regardless of the size of SD card I installed. The very definition of ""planned obsolescence"". Wanting to avoid this with my next phone, I bought something with more storage and memory this time around.SCREEN:After 2 Galaxy A15\'s had phantom screen press issues I decided to give the A25 a try since online resources suggested it had a different screen. Thankfully I\'ve yet to have any phantom screen press issues about 2 months since receipt.Per gsmarena.com the A15\'s features a 800-nit screen, while the A25 features a 1000-nit screen. The noticeable difference here is that the A25 is actually usable in sunlight. The A15 is too dim. This is very important, and I feel a huge drawback of the A15.BATTERY:I subjectively feel like the A25 runs down the battery a bit faster than the A15. This does make sense given the hardware. Per nanoreview.net the SOC of this phone is more powerful than that of the A15, with a lower battery life rating. Per gsmarena.com the A25 has a 120Hz screen vs. the 90Hz of the A15, while both phones feature 5000 mAh batteries.Either someone at Google decided to finally build battery charge thresholds into Android after 14 versions (better late than never?), or this phone, due to price point and/or hardware, supports them. This should help improve battery lifespan of this phone.Neither the A15 or A25 feature wireless charging. I don\'t care. You might.HARDWARE:I DO care that both feature 3.5mm jacks. They make life so much better. Locating it on the bottom, unlike the A01\'s top-mounted 3.5mm jack, makes it easier to route a cable when it\'s in a pocket or car mount.It supports either dual SIM or one SIM and a microSDXC. This also makes life much better. I wish it could hold 2 SIMs AND a microSDXC at once, but it\'s better than nothing I suppose.The cameras are pretty good, but get grainy/pixelated when zooming in. My camera needs are modest compared to some, so I\'m satisfied.The notch for the front camera is fine. In fact I grew to like the status info (battery, WiFi/cellular, notification icons, etc) being at the top, next to the notch, in the A01, giving more room to apps.The inclusion of stereo loudspeakers is a nice upgrade from the A15, especially considering the price increase. If you hold the phone at an off-angle they can sound strange due to the angle. For best results hold the phone with the screen flat toward your face.It gets a bit warmer than the A15. A quick internet search suggests it\'s the Exynos SOC. Thumbs down.I\'m not particularly tough on my phones, so the plastic construction is fine for me. I put it in a silicone case. This makes it easier to grab, and was potentially far less expensive than buying a phone with metal construction.SIZE:The phone\'s too big*. The A01 was too big at 5.7"", and the A25 is worse 6.5"". I have long fingers and it\'s impossible to reach the top of the screen (where one might find a close or menu button in an app) one-handed without major grip adjustment, risking dropping the phone. The A01 was borderline uncomfortable in the (large) pockets of my pants, the A15/A25 cross the border. Squatting down must be carefully done lest it dig into your hip and cause discomfort or pain. Yes viewing more of web pages is nice. Yes I have to thumb to the next page of ebooks less when there are more words on-screen. Yes, more screen real estate is nice for Google Maps. But I don\'t NEED those things. In fact, I\'d rather have an easier-to-carry PHONE, not a PHABLET I have to buy military cargo pants or a purse to comfortably carry.SOFTWARE:Mostly stable and as-expected: minimal changes to Android and the usual Samsung bloatware. There are some issues but I\'m not sure if I can blame Samsung.1. Expo Go (an app used for mobile app development) doesn\'t allow interaction with the app I\'m helping develop. Expo Go itself works fine on both the A15 and A25, but the in-development app would appear frozen. The in-development app works perfectly on Expo Go on the A01.2. ** 2nd Edit: The issue has resurfaced, and I\'ve had to switch to a different camera app. Edit: this issue appears to have been resolved, perhaps via one of the updates the phone received since I wrote about it. Original issue text: ""I set the ""side button"" (power button) to turn on the flashlight when double-pressed. Using the included camera app before using the side button to turn on the flashlight results in the flashlight not working. This can be fixed by clearing the camera app\'s cache every time you want to use the flashlight, or using a different camera app. For all I know there\'s a fix for these, but I haven\'t found it yet (and I\'ve looked).""3. Some third-party apps fail to start and require a second screen tap.VALUE:This phone is exiting the budget segment toward mid-range, but you get more for your money compared to an entry-level phone. More computing power, more storage and memory, an ultrawide camera, stereo speakers, a better screen than the A15, while retaining a 3.5mm jack.*But ""the market"" wants big phones (see the Marques Brownlee video ""Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them"" video for more).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Passingby', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'the best phone for the $$$$', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've only had it for a few days now and it's hurting me to send it back because someone got me the s24 Plus for free BUT BUY THIS PHONE!!!. it feels and runs like a high end phone, I loved the pictures it took and the all around feel of it.

I was an hour away from our house and received a call from my wife. Signal wasn't the greatest but at least I could understand her. When I went to leave, I opened Google Maps to show me the way home.

Well, I was only 1/2 hour from home and phone still gave 'no connection' message. Frustrated, I pulled over, shut the phone down and restarted it. Magically, it now had a connection!2 - Today it would not make a call (even 911!), all incoming calls went straight to voicemail and call history did not even show these calls. Restarted phone and magically, everything was ok!3 - Samsung music player in new phones does not play WMA files where the Samsung player in my old A51 would.I can't believe I spent this much money on a phone that I apparently need to restart every few days to get it to function properly and to restart it when I go out of range (I was only 1 county over).I may get iPhone next time or if an Android, definitely NOT Samsung.\nRead more""}]",,,Galaxy A25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

It allows my child to make and receive phone calls, as well as to do basic texts. A simple call to T-Mobile customer service on her prepaid Sim card plan allowed me to shut the data off. It does have Wi-Fi so if your goal is to eliminate social media, you’re going to have to block this device on your router. I have Comcast and it allows me to Restrict Wi-Fi access based upon each device attached to the network. Don’t underestimate your child’s ability to find other Wi-Fi sources, but the operating system on this phone render it relatively useless. The phone can still access the Internet through an installed browser in the operating system, but it’s fairly rudimentary and , I suspect that it in effect eliminates the desire for social media since it’s so difficult to type out a sentence on a numeric keypad. So my recommendation is 1) buy this flip phone 2) get a T-Mobile, prepaid Sim card and pair it to your child’s cell phone number after you’ve ported the number to T-Mobile 3) select the $10 a month prepaid plan 4) call T-Mobile customer service and ask them to shut off the data on that phone number. They will give you our time and tell you that that isn’t an option, but it is an option and you just need to continue to insist on it and speak to a supervisor if they aren’t willing or able to do what you’re asking.  5) finally, block, access to Wi-Fi on your router for this device.

KaiOS is a stripped down version of Android running on a little processor that isn\'t capable of keeping up with the demands of Android bloat.  For example, open the phone, and in big numerals it will show you the time _that you last opened the phone_.  It may take up to a minute to update and show the actual time.  (You can train yourself you read the actual time on the tiny status bar.)  Sending a text message?  Type slowly because it won\'t keep up.(And good luck finding basic punctuation marks like the apostrophe or capitalizing a name in the middle of a sentence.  And your preferences for which text typing mode you like are constantly being reset to bad defaults.)The UI is unnecessarily cumbersome.  If you receive a spam text (aren\'t they all?), you\'re going to have to press a lot of buttons several times to delete it.I don\'t have a data plan because all I need is the occasional call and even rarer SMS message.  But if this phone ever gets access to data for even a moment, it starts trying to update.  And when that data is interrupted, your notifications will be spammed with a slew of error messages.  And, sometimes, that leaves key apps, like your contact list, inaccessible.The beauty of Type C USB connectors is that you can insert them either way.  However, if your charger and cable support PD (Power Delivery) and/or QC (Quick Charge), the phone will charge only when the cable is plugged in the ""right"" way.  If you leave it overnight on a charger with the cable the wrong way around, you\'ll wake up to a dead battery.  From what I\'ve read, you have to go out of your way to design a Type C USB port that isn\'t symmetric.  But why would you do that?  (And the battery life is terrible compared to previous feature phones I\'ve had.  Putting Android under the hood may have been an expedient way to create KaiOS, but you can\'t throw that at a low power processor and expect it not to burn through the battery.)Oh, I almost forgot about Bluetooth.  This phone fails to pair with my car.  My car thinks the pairing is successful, but the phone does not.  This phone does pair with my wife\'s car, but not mine.  Every other phone I\'ve used was able to pair with both cars.I don\'t have a great need for a cell phone (coverage at home is spotty at best), so I haven\'t gone looking for an alternative.  Yesterday, however, the phone died, a just few days short of 10 months of very light usage.  Outer screen won\'t light up.  Inner screen is filled with random pixel values.  If I call it, it doesn\'t even ring, so it\'s not _just_ a display failure.This device doesn\'t reach even the most minimal requirements of a cell phone.  If Nokia still cared one iota about its brand name, it never would have authorized this disaster.  It\'s actually worse that the Kazuna eTalk, which I wouldn\'t have imagined was possible.

I'm talking about quality wise. The old ones I had were built like tanks but it seems like none of the companies want to sink that effort into the new ones. I guess this one is close.It runs on KaiOS so you do get a few more app type options which I really didn't care about. If I still wanted apps, I would've stuck with my smart phone. Apps on this thing are just mobile Firefox web pages and they're flaky, don't work well with scrolling or clicking so don't expect much.Even email isn't going to impress anybody on KaiOS. You might as well only set up one account cause that's all you can use at one time anyway. If you want notifications from a different email account, you have to physically switch over to that account. Luckily, again, I wasn't looking for email features.Texting is the painful T-9 again which, due to the addition of all phones using the number 1 for voicemail, throws all the letters off by one, so any old muscle memory training you had from years ago is going to get screwed up. You have to retrain yourself on T-9 again. Fortunately, this phone has nice big keys so it has been easier than a couple of other flip phones I've tried. BUT, the biggest bonus with this phone as for texting has to be the voice input, which is actually fairly decent. I was impressed with how accurate and easy, easier than using the T-9 input, to enter quick texts. I'd recommend trying and using that feature as it will save you lots of grief trying to type.Ultimately, it's still a quality thing for me and this phone doesn't quite meet the same standards as my old flip phones. It's noticeably very plastic and also quite slippery in the hand. I'd strongly recommend getting the textured form fitting case at the same time or chances are good the thing is going to slide out of your hand.The battery length is probably it's best feature as it lasts a good 2-3 days depending on use. I never have to worry about charging it in the car as I can throw it on the charger at home for an hour or two and it's full again and ready for another couple of days.The blue color I ordered does not look like the pictures at all. It's more of a turquoise blue-green which I can't stand. I would've ordered the red had I known but I don't know if that would've looked like the pics or been more orange-red so unless you can physically see one, it's a gamble. Thankfully I ordered the textured case in black so it pretty much covers all of the ugly color of the phone anyway.I had been using the Nokia 8810 banana phone prior to this one and thankfully, the 2760 has far more processing power so you can actually do stuff without totally bogging the thing down like I found on the 8810.There is some bugs with the use of an sd card as well. I got mine all ready from my computer, and while the phone can see it and browse the files, it can't find any music files so I also can't change any ring tones. People on forums have said they have had some luck formatting the card on the phone itself but still run into problems when they try to hook the card back up to their PC to add music, etc. as the computer wants to reformat it again so it's a viscous circle. I didn't care enough about ring tones and music to bother fighting with this so I just left it as is for now.Overall, if you are looking for a modern flip phone that is somewhat close to old school quality and don't care about apps or anything other than having something for making calls and short texts, this is about the best I've found for a reasonable price. If Nokia, or some company, would offer a updated version of almost any old flip phone as far as build quality, I really think they would have a good size market of users who are wanting to get rid of a lot of their tech and go old school like me.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Néstor', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on February 1, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Mi papá está contento\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Aldo Manuel', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 31, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Falló a las tres semanas.Buena calidad en las llamadas, buena calidad de construcción, pero no tanto en los materiales.

I’m passionate about smartphones, and I’ve loved previous high end Androids. This has a few key advantages over those devices.Simplicity. I used to compile my own Gentoo. I understand the value of FOSS. Still, I’ve come to decide that a personal communicator/ data assistant needs to be usable above all else. iOS is feature-complete, thoughtfully efficient, and free of redundancy beyond Android. The toddler’s interface i used on the iPod touch has matured into what it was meant to beReliability. I’ve never had big problems with Android, but it can hiccup. On every phone I’ve used over more than a decade, I’ve occasionally experienced minor crashes, GPS gremlins, battery drains, cooling anomalies, and inscrutable major app discontinuations. In nearly a year of use, this old midrange iPhone has been utterly rock solid and i am confident Apple will not yank the rug out from under any of its core utilities. I do not manage the RAM on this phone or track battery usage. It’s just normal at all times.Durability. I do not use phone cases. The concept is a bit bizarre to me from a design standpoint. It’s not ideal, but i just try to be very careful with my phone. I’m good enough at it that, since smartphones emerged, it has been overall worth it for me despite eventually breaking two phones in that period. Still, I’m aging and I’ve dropped it. It’s clear that this phone is comprehensively designed; the materials and structure are unbelievably resistant to impact on hard surfaces. The damage to my phone is entirely cosmetic to the aluminum frame, and frankly makes me smile that it worked as intended in the face of adversity.Performance. My last phone had significantly more raw computing power than this phone. Still, this phone has a smoother UI and, in my opinion, marks a significant point of diminishing returns in mobile processing power. Clearly, little of the hardware is wasted. It is well balanced.Criticisms include: the ability to edit large blocks of text in iMessage has degraded since the last update. Moving the cursor has become more difficult. Battery life is mediocre. I can confidently get a day of normal use or a few hours of streaming video, and i have to charge it every night. My refurbished phone arrived with a gouge in the screen which i consider barely acceptable.The experience is great. I’ve lost interest in cracking software and customizing each UI element with unlimited freedom in favor of a workflow that aligns with my long-term goals. In that regard this phone excels. Lovely bit of hardware and software.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'bsan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great product.

The product that was originally sent out to me had a broken microphone for video recording. The battery health was at 81% (not terrible because Amazon guarantees a 80 or higher, so it wasn’t super bad but just wasn’t ideal). There were very minute scuffs to the top of the phone but nothing bad, more like you can tell someone might’ve lightly brushed the phone along a wooden table and slid it or something. The main complaint was that the product was faulty. So I sent it back.Secondly, the pros.MOBILESUPPLY was fast with replying, regardless of the time. They were fast and helpful with the process. A few days after I shipped the phone, they received it and shipped it to me the next day. The phone right now has a few scuffs but again, nothing too bad, you’d have to look at the phone from very specific lightings and angles to see the very SMALL and light scuffs.

I upgraded from the Pixel 5a due to support for that supposedly ending soon. I saw the 8a on sale so pounced. I'm mostly going to compare the 8a to the 5a. Keep in mind I really liked the 5a.8a vs 5aBattery life : 5a wins (slightly). I'm not sure how they compare on mAh but the 5a kept a charge a little longer. That's not to say the 8a won't last long. It pretty much always gets me through the day and I don't really feel held back by the difference.Screen: 8a wins (slightly). 8a is a little crisper, overall both are very good. Downside to the 8a is the screen size was a hair smaller I believe.Camera: 8a wins solidly. 5a took good pictures. 8a is even better, especially in low light. I also found the 8a AI editing feature to be handy at times.Charging: Mixed bag. 5a had a faster charging speed (although no Turbo charge). But I like having the wireless charging in the 8a which the 5a didn't have. After about 2yrs of 5a use the port was kinda loose. Wireless charging should negate that later problem of the port wearing out.Functional speed: 8a wins. 5a wasn't slow, but 8a is a little snappier.Headphone jack: 5a wins only because the 5a had one, 8a does not have a headphone jack. Most of my headphones/ear buds I use are wireless, but I still use a few wired ones. But you can get an adapter which has worked fine for the 8a.**Fingerprint reader/sensor: 5a wins by a long shot. This is the reason I removed a star. The 5a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone worked right nearly every time (except with moist fingers). The 8a in screen finger reader works more than half the time, but was is far less accurate than the 5a method. To make matters worse, I think the Pixel engineers forgot most people like to put a screen protector on. With a screen protector on the 8a, the fingerprint reader is nearly useless. (I had tried resetting the fingerprint scans to no avail). Maybe this wasn't the engineers' fault. Maybe a sales exec thought a fingerprint sensor on the screen sounded cool so demanded it while the engineers said it needed more work. But I digress.Out of frustration, I had started using the less secure face unlock which does work reasonably well. But the face unlock doesn't work well if you're wearing sunglasses or in dimly lit rooms. So, I've had to type the numerical unlock a lot more with the 8a.Overall this is a good phone at this price point that does most of what the expensive phones can do. But they need to overhaul the fingerprint sensor. Either move it to the back again or improve it so that it a) works nearly every time and b) works with most screen protectors.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Szozz', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Avoid - Persistent Bluetooth and Network issues', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Purchased July 2024.

The camera is great, even at 8x zoom. Night photos were awful at first but by it improved greatly by increasing the aperture open time to 6s from 3s. Astrophotography is just wow. Pictures look better in the gallery than in the camera so it's post-processing more than hardware but hey, as long as I get crisp shots.Fingerprint sensor is not good. Often doesn't recognize my prints and works slower than my iPhone 6s I just switched from. Someone on reddit said to register the same finger twice but it didn't help much.I was concerned about the battery because the one on my 6s was awful and I didn't want to care about conserving battery on a regular day ever again.

These are so expensive but there treated like scratch technology.  After using it for a couple days I can say the camera is great but I did think it needed a better face for the video capture but thats one of the small things you notice about cameras, they may look better in person than the camera for video capture meaning that you need a really attractive face or its a character and what features do you like about the character and what you don't, its one of things about the technology that I really found to be one of the potential problems because real life interactions are usually better but for photos I was thinking these are better than video capture.After really looking at the image quality I think its lacking in comparison to an IMAX for daytime photos and the video capture in 4K didn't quite meet my expectations for film, I wouldn't be using this for filming Planet Earth, a huge amount of data in the imagery that was non existent, not as good as the photographs at 8.3MP at 4K.  These are great for using if you don't have an expensive camera but don't expect it be a replacement for the film industry.  Comparing the video quality to someone elses it did look like mine was out of focus, it does seem to be how I was panning the camera that it was going out of focus or something, the quality didn't really look worse but there was some motion blur.Really looking at the image quality for distance photos I needed better quality images, im feeling like I needed a better camera and when compared to a less expensive smartphone these are great images but thats only this much better for distance photos and yhea there better selfie images of faces but its also a different style of quality, the faces look different, they look like completely different people being photographed and that means you might like how the person looks with a different phone because of the difference.After using the phone for enough time to determine if I needed a case protector, ive decided it almost feels like if I was using it alot and not being as careful id definitely need to get one but so far it doesn't seem like im going to drop this phone, Ive not used it enough in a way id need case protector but im sort of feeling like id need one, im using the box it came with and that seems sufficient for storing it but it could use a case protector or something else to store it in but it seems like an extra cost until its used in a way that it would feel like it needed one for sure but im not using it quite like that so im ok for now but it does feel that way.  I don't wanna replace it or if there was enough damage that it didn't work id need it, im already feeling like its not for any fast movements, I can probably use it without mostly but as soon as I start using it in a certain setting I need a case protector, like im already feeling like I want to buy one just so its there to use if I needed one.I found where the camera is lacking for photos and that is anything to do with distance and leafs or bright sunlight shining at the camera somewhat as in it didn't look better than a smartphone less than half the price but for most photos it does work and it doesn't have any effect of something being tall.  The quality of the images does still need to be better for a photographer, id consider upgrading to a better camera at this part of my experience with the phone but it does show enough detail to be impressed with the level of detail.After quite of bit use with this camera im really looking for a higher quality image, im quite satisfied with the closeup photos and the distance are quite good to but if you looked at the photographs from the most expensive cameras you would be looking for better image quality.  It really struggles to look the same as the eyesight.  I realized what it was that wasn't quite there after really examining the photo quality is that you need to take professional photos with a PhaseOne or something similar to it, the Huawei smartphone cameras take great photos and so do the Pixel phones but the file size is completely different, these are fantastic images with the smartphones but your comparing them now.What I found somewhat of a complication with previewing the larger non smartphone cameras is that theres alot of settings and options on them that you may not understand at first making smartphones the easiest decision for actually taking photos but the need to see the the highest quality image is there in my mind.I am finding that if you want to zoom in after you take a photo it is to blurry and that is even from two feet away so it seems to be that there is interest in taking higher quality photos than this.  I was looking at it like it was important for that to be better or you'd need to take a macro photo.Looking at it from the perspective of thickness in the image of the detail, I can't feel these enough even though the image quality is really good, there not 3d, its a very flat image and you'll notice that with the really high mega pixel cameras it has the right amount of detail and this was enough but it also needed additional detail, its reaching the distance but its not quite there yet.Im just looking at these photos and thinking I really don't like that the clarity that you'd see with the eyesight or a really expensive camera isn't there and though I can zoom in and it looks better, I can zoom in and it looks better but 94% zoom im thinking these should be clearer, 146% zoom the background looks like a painting, 200%+ zoom these are not clear enough at all.  Id really think that close up photos are good but theres still a level of not being able to focus the camera, it needs a stand or something.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Muhammad Omair Ali', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on June 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Nice, I like the product and working good\nRead more'}]",,,Google Pixel 8a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

No trash bloat apps from carriers and my recommendation is to go into app info of all the apps you don't use and hit disable on them and enable remove animations in accessibility settings to make the phone feel super quick. It's a generally good phone and I just needed something smaller and after my previous phone was too big in my pocket. I don't game on my phone but I wouldn't expect 60fps from newer games on this. I use the headphone jack daily and there's no hissing or unwanted noise from the internal dac so it's good enough for Spotify or your mp3s. Fingerprint is fast and my only gripe is I hated the stock launcher it came with so I just use the Microsoft launcher from the play store. It's a phone and if youre just some guy or gal that needs something reliable Id say this is a good place to start.

Ever.  Never will.  I like flagship phones though, and will buy a new-old-stock, or pristine used, 2 year old flagship model.  This seemed to work for me quite well.  I still have an iPhone 8 Plus that is awesome.  Also part of the equation is security updates.  Frequent, regular, like clockwork, security updates.With iPhone this is standard.  With android phone makers, it\'s hit and miss, mostly miss.  Samsung does update their flagship frequently... for a time.  But Samsung wants $1200 for their flagship.  No thanks.Pixel?  I heard Google provides regular, systematic updates.  Their phones don\'t cost $1000.  Saw some good things said about the Pixel, thought I\'d try the Pixel 4a 5G and see if I liked it.  I do.I don\'t have complex needs.  Other than good security, and frequent security updates, I also like good pictures and video.  The phone is light, the battery lasts a long time, the screen is just a little bit smaller than my iPhone 8 Plus and far lighter.The iPhone 8 Plus was a flagship at one time, and you can tell.  The build quality is phenomenol.  It\'s also heavy, feels expensive, and the feature set and ecosphere quite complete.  Almost heavy-ish.  I love the phone, and it\'s my backup now.  The Pixel 4a 5G is minimalist, light, leaves you ""uninvolved"" or slightly detached from the massive Google ecosphere, unless you go in and configure the various bits and pieces of it.I\'m very pleased with my purchase.  Refreshing alternative to Samsung.  Don\'t get me wrong, Samsung flagship is a beast.  But I never buy new $1000 plus phones.  So the best that I could do is buy a used or NOS Samsung Note, which I did (a Note 9), and it was a terrible experience.  Old android version, build quality was not too hot.  If you ever look at buying a flagship phone that is 2 or 3 versons behind, Samsung can\'t cut it.  Apple is much better in that scenario.  But I\'m glad that there\'s something that ""fills the gap"" between flagship phones, and just a nice, new, current, phone with frequent updates.  Who better to get an android device from, then the people who make android?\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tcat', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""It's NEW!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Couldn't believe I could buy a brand new Pixel 4a5G 4 years after released.

And it\'s THIN!  And it\'s LIGHT! - Only 168 grams!There\'s only one problem, however.  It is as fragile as a potato chip.  Six days ago, I was walking through my neighborhood with my nine-month-old Google Pixel 4A 5G in my front right pants pocket.  The Pixel was encased in a Spigen Tough Armor case and was equipped with a tempered glass screen protector.  Due to an unfortunate encounter with a dog, I tripped and fell - on my back, mind you.  I was fortunately not hurt (although to this day I hope that worthless dog gets struck by lightning), but when I pulled my Pixel out of my pocket to exchange phone numbers with the dog\'s owner, I discovered the damage you see in the attached pictures.  The phone display showed what I can only describe as a ""green screen of death.""  From that moment to now, the phone has been totally unusable.  The front screen is destroyed, the headphone jack is destroyed, and the back cover has partially separated from the front of the phone.  And all this from a drop of about 33 inches.  (I\'m not a tall guy!)  A drop that occurred while the phone was not only in its protective case, but was still in my pocket!Which leads to two philosophical questions.  First, if a phone has impressive capabilities, yet is too fragile to take with you on a walk, what good is it?  I don\'t play video games, nor do I watch movies on smartphones.  And if I want to take pictures, there are plenty of good cameras that I can buy.  My Pixel\'s capabilities are worthless to me now, and I am out $500 dollars for a phone that\'s turned into a piece of junk.Second, what\'s with the obsession that manufacturers and sellers of certain things have with weight and size?  We\'re constantly being bombarded with marketing that says that we should buy the lightest, thinnest versions of certain very expensive things - as if the presence of even two or three extra grams will pin us to the ground.  It\'s not like we\'re competing in the summer Olympics!  I am thinking right now of the Greek myth of Sisyphus being punished eternally by being forced to roll a large boulder up a hill only to have the boulder slip out of his hands just before he gets to the hilltop.  And I can imagine someone coming to him and saying, ""Dude - the reason you can\'t roll that rock over the hill is because of the smartphone you\'re carrying!  It adds weight and slows you down!  You should buy one of our phones, because they don\'t weigh anything more than air!""  Thin + light does not always equal ""cutting-edge quality.""  Thin + light = cheap sometimes.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Davit Yepiskoposyan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Genuine Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Great genuine Google Pixel 4a 5g phone, fast delievery.

The night mode is also good. the ultra wide is not exactly ultra wide as you see on other phones but it does take some good ultra wide photos and you also get the unlimited backup on this pixel. This feature is not available for pixel 5 and above devices. So this pixel 4a 5g is the last device to have this.The battery is okish, it can get you through the day. I use this as a secondary device so I can get easily 2 days with it.The display is very good but if you come from using a QuadHD+ display then you might notice some subtle difference. the touch responsiveness is also very good. Always on display is nice to have.It comes with 5g so its future proof. I got this shipped with android 11 but got the update for android 13 right after I turned it on.( android 13 launched just a few days ago). In terms of latest updates you will get all latest updates ahead of any other manufacturer.The ram management is okish but it can suffice daily usage requirements. This phone is not for high performance. I am yet to install pubg on this and test it on that angle.the phone comes with a 18W type charger and cable included but the pin is not the indian pin, it is the standard western pin. but its good to see a charging brick in the box these days. the charging speed is not damn good, its okish. It takes 1.5hrs something to charge to 100%I would recommend you to not update the software on this phone and go with the software it comes out of the box. The more you update, the sh*ttier the phone gets later on (speaking from personal experience from android phones).After 3 months :So I’ve updated the phone and it is working really good(that is something I’ve never expected from an android). The charging time is too much if you use it moderately.Multi tasking is a nightmare and this phone can’t handle heavy gaming as well. I tried pubg in lowest settings and high frame rate. It lags but it can manage. I am looking to buy a more watt power brick for this may be a 65W brick as I’m not used to wait for so long to charge the phone. I used one plus and iPhones before so they charge so much faster and this charges so slow even with 18W charger.\nRead more'}]",,,Pixel 4a 5G,Just Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

Also, Apple has removed the physical SIM slot for IPhone 14 for US customers.Transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iPhone to iPhone 14 wasn’t difficult.  It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'S&K', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Wonderful product and would recommend!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I had an older android and was having a hard time deciding what, and when to get, a new phone. I love Android and I was really intrigued with the Google and Asus phones. I have had a galaxy since the beginning of smart phones it would seem. Well, looking at all options as well, the red iPhone caught my attention solely in color. I know IPhone is a good phone, for the most part, everyone I know seems to have iPhone or Galaxy. I have never owned an iPhone and they are much more expensive than the phones I was looking at. But the red iPhone, I just kept coming back to. I started looking into the differences, and then started looking into refurbished. I have also never purchased a refurbished phone. The price difference for a “Premium” or “excellent” condition iPhone, was significantly cheaper than buying brand new. I went back and forth on Amazon, with different sellers based on reviews, and ended up landing in the option where it is sold and shipped by Amazon themselves (which I thought was more likely to be exactly what is described in their product page). I will say the first try to purchase did not go through, so there were some issues with the monthly insurance plan for the phone. But the second time it did go through, and I was having to wait probably 4 days for it to get here. I was so excited, like a kid waiting for Christmas to get here.Finally the iPhone arrived, and in absolute perfect condition. I went with the “premium refurbished” option. The delivery was incredibly secure and the driver was extra helpful before they arrived so we could time it. I opened the box and there is not one scratch or thing that would tell you that this isn’t a brand new phone. It comes with a charger, block and the phone information on a leaflet (that would otherwise be in the original iPhone packaging). I did wait to activate it, until I had time to go into a physical carrier store, but I backed up everything before I did that in my old phone. It took maybe 5 minutes for the associate at my carrier store, to set the iPhone up and transfer everything I wanted from my galaxy and the service, to the iPhone. I was worried based on other reviews that it could possibly not be unlocked to all carriers, but it was. One of the main reasons I chose to buy the refurbished option from the sold by/ships by Amazon option, because I trusted the accuracy of the description more.ALL THAT SAID beautiful phone, looks brand new, works like it’s brand new, has 100% battery life out of the box and is very easy to get used to (even if you have had an android all your adult life). I definitely recommend this product and Amazon as the seller to ensure you get what you are looking for. I am SO happy with my purchase and when it comes time to get a new phone a few years from now, I will be starting here this time!

I stayed on the Note 9 for many years, and finally, when my provider could no longer replace my Note 9 under extended warranty, I was forced to look at another brand.Enter the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024!  Amazon was running a promotion on this brand new release from Motorola, and at $317.95 for a brand new unlocked Moto flagship, I was absolutely down for that.  I got so used to paying $1,300 to $1,500 for the latest Samsung flagship phone release, I almost forgot what bang for the buck value looked like! :)As I walked through the Specs of this phone, I couldn\'t help but feel like, wow, I\'ve been overpaying for a large screen and stylus forever....need to try something new.  And I wasn\'t dissapointed!  I had been considering the Pixel 8 Pro for several months, but I couldn\'t get one from my mobile provider, and I couldn\'t get a good deal for an unlocked version ($799 to $999) so I started looking at Motorola.Low and behold, their latest flagship Stylus 5G (just launched in May 2024) was on Promo :)  The big draw for me with both the Pixel and the Moto Stylus was that they were Google phones...literally.  Everything about them was Google centric.  And better yet, no bloatware or stupid useless skins over the Android experience.  Just pure Google/Android and great Apps.The new phone transfer process was seamless and super easy!  I just took my Sim Card out of my old handset, and threw it into the Moto G Stylus, and immediately Google\'s phone transfer process kicked in.  Step by step, device to device, in about 45 minutes I was done.  That\'s it, easy peezy.My initial few days with the new Moto, man, a $1,000 less in cost for very good performance, 120Hz refresh rate, Google centric Android experience, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of Flash Storage, Nice Aluminum stylus, good Apps for Notes, Art/Drawing, Editing, etc.  WiFi performance is excellent, Cellular reception is much better than my previous $1,400 Note 9, Bluetooth range is excellent, Camera is solid, with Pro features and capabilities if you wanna get all high end with your cameras, camera software is way better than the 2023 version, MP is up(50), camera quality is way up (software improvements), embedded storage is more than adequate for on device storage needs (256GB\'s is a lot of local storage, when you store everything to Google Drive), and the performance of the SnapDragon SOC, while not the latest and greatest, it powers through moderate gaming, is awesome for media consumption (streaming video) UI is super fluid, no jittery transitions, swipe is butter, couldn\'t be happier with the overall performance.It comes loaded with Android 14, it has an Audio Jack port! and it supports Micro SD card storage up to 2TB (although I haven\'t physically confirmed that) and Dolby ATMOS with two very capable speakers integrated for excellent sound performance.  The 6.7"" pOLED screen is outstanding, Refresh Rate is awesome (120Hz), SnapDragon 6 SOC is solid, all that and the all day 5,000mAh battery + rapid charging (35W wired, 15W wireless)  you\'ve got as complete a package as I\'ve ever seen.In short, I\'m done paying an arm and a leg for technology I don\'t really need.  Give me rock solid value every day.  The Moto G Stylus 2024 is just that, Maximum bang for the buck on every front, and I don\'t have to take out a 24 month loan to buy it!!!  I would highly recommend trying this handset out!8/29/24 Quick update for everyone on adding MSD storage to the phone. 2TB\'s is overkill for me because I use Google Drive for backup and Amazon Photo\'s as well, so I don\'t need ton\'s of onboard storage, but for the sake of checking out the Micro SD card capability, I dropped $35 on a 1TB SanDisk High Speed MSD, dropped it in, and instantly recognized as external (not embedded) storage, and the only choice you need to make is whether you want to format it such that you can move the card to any device as external storage, or leave it as phone dedicated storage and you\'re done.  Once again, seamless experience, no hassles, no incompatibility problems, nothing.  Plug and Play.  Having used the handset now for several weeks, it\'s more awesome than I originally thought.  It just does soooo much for so little cash, I\'m giving it a 10 out of 10.  Lesson learned, don\'t be a slave to specs.  This phone is boss, hands down the best stylus enabled large handset for the buck.  I can\'t wait to see the next gen of this handset......all smiles friends :) :) :)\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mike F.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone, nice screen', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Good phone for the price.Good:Price, smooth operation, great screen, strong speaker volume, has NFC, wireless charging, moto gestures (actually pretty useful, chop-chop motion to turn on the light, and twist to turn on the camera).

It's a genetic thing and I can't do much about it. I say this, because when I realized the battery in my 2021 Moto Stylus G is not staying charged, I needed to get a replacement that preferably had a nice camera with stabilizing ability. I almost got a high-end phone, but then I realized that almost none of them has expandable memory. I am not okay with that. I did some research on the latest Moto Stylus phone and I liked what I read. Now that, I've had a few days to test it out, I like it a lot. I'll lay out a few reasons. by the way, I took the two pictures above with the Moto Stylus 2021 and Moto Stylus 2024. I'll let you guess which picture is from which.#1 Camera -- my favorite feature of this phone is the camera. I don't know if the camera has a physical or software stabilizer, or both; to me it doesn't matter, because my pictures turn out so much better!#2 Speed -- I'm used to turning on my phone and waiting a bit for it to load up after a reset. This new stylus phone loads up really quickly and I'm surprised at how quickly I can use it.#3 -- The Stylus -- The stylus has a newer design to it. To me it feels more sturdy and easier to use than my old stylus#4 -- Software -- The software seems improved overall. I am enjoying all the minor tweaks that Android has made since version 11.#5A -- Finger sensor -- I'm not a fan of the change. The finger sensor is now on the screen. I like having the sensor on the back of the device. I realize they did this, to allow for wireless charging; so most will prefer this. Also, I don't really need the finger sensor anymore, because of facial unlocking; nevertheless, I still prefer the finger sensor to be on the back of the device.#5B -- Facial sensor -- A new feature for me, this works great; I have a beard, and the phone has no problem recognizing me.#6 -- Screen -- The LED screen on the old Moto, was pretty good; however, the OLED screen on the new phone is really nice.#7 -- I reused the SD card from my old device, however, it works well and I have no lag in performance using it. I also look forward to upgrading it in the future, should I run out of room... 2 TB is an insane amount of space.Pros:Excellent cameraProcessor and ram are fastStylus feels goodSoftware has good improvements over allThe new OLED screen is a good leap forwardCan hold up to 2 TB of add on storageCon:Finger sensor now on the screen instead of the back of the device.\nRead more""}]",,120 Hz,Moto G Stylus 5G (2024),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jeff & Dawn Jones', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Like new shape, even the battery.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone works perfectly!

I have a limited budget and am tired of it all so we can buy more Chinese stuff.  Finally, after an hour with this clown and sorry excuse for customer service, I finally asked for a 2-tier up manager who had to read the entire thread from the beginning.  My hands are totally numb and I suffer from Associative Disorder which causes me to look at one key and type another (too many concussions).  The guy even questioned the spelling of my words!!  I think he thought he could wear me out like a dishcloth.  Nope, didn't happen.  After a very long hour, the manager finally gave me my money back.  I really was uncomfortable and asked for an apology for treating a disabled Vet with such disrespect and disdain for the elderly.  A major fubar and a sad day for Amazon.  Shame shame shame.  Disgusting corporate customer-centrics for my money and they did not apologize.  Lt.

I'm continually pleased more and more as I use it. Look, I don't delve deep into specs or drool over asthetics - I just want a phone that does what it's supposed to do. But it sure does look nice all the same. Add a Poetic case and it will feel solid in your hand and it will sit without wobble from the cameras. It's fast. The screen looks great. Speakers are rather loud with volume up but of course you aren't likely to play music using only the speakers, you'll stream it to some Bluetooth speakers or use ear buds. Android 14 is slick and easy to use. As always, Motorola adds only a few gesture options and a few moto specialty assists but you don't need to use them - you will, though! No added bloat, almost pure Android. The cameras are far better than the moto cams of old. I have no complaints. Charges ridiculously fast. Battery lasts 2 days or more normal use, I haven't drained it fully to see exactly how long but I'm very happy with the battery life. The power button below the volume is weird at first but it's easy to get used to. You can power off using the button on the screen near the settings icon so you rarely need the physical button anyway. You can also change the very odd default setting for power off using the power key and volume button same time, which is awkward. Just check the settings and switch it to power off with just the power button. I love a big phone so I'm happy with the size. And here's something unexpected that I really appreciate - the screen is smudge resistant and does a great job of keeping prints off it. The phone looks nice all the time, no greasy fingerprints for the most part. When you do notice it needs a wipe, a soft cloth and literally 2 seconds to get it perfect again is all you need. Any marks come right off without smudging. The haptics give a great feel as you navigate. The price is excellent for the quality of this phone. Highly recommended.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'kyle olson', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing phone in 2024. Superb battery life. Beautiful screen. Impressive camera.

I'm able to use my phone while on my computer at work. It has made phone usage and communication so much better.  It has so many features I would need to make a video about it.The 5G is blazing fast on ATT prepaid.  You'd think it would cost extra to see speeds increase this much! Only had 4g before.It has great Bluetooth specs, supports aptX Adaptive Lossless. Usually that's reserved for the top flagships!  I use wired so I won't use it soon, but will be nice if I need it.Face unlock is so fast it usually beats my fingerprint!Cons:It's missing expandable storage, and a headphone jack.  I was holding out for a phone that had those two specs, but this phone's price and performance won me overIt gets a bit warm when using the phone.  It's never super concerning, but it's definitely a reminder for me to set my phone for down for a bit to cool off.Overall, hands down an amazing purchase for under $400. I would recommend to anyone looking for an android at $400 or less\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Erin A.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Motorola Think phone 2023 most reviews are for other phones in the same column 🤔', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024', 'Review Body': ""When searching for mid-range phones that perform well, have enhanced durability waterproofing and are not excessively pokey, the Motorola think from 2023 is a fantastic choice.

The gorilla Glass Victus screen with military spec drop protection as well as ip68 waterproofing is reassuring. At under $400 price is fair. The phone is not overly bulky, it performs a snappy as any other, the screen is great. Basically this is a flagship phone spec from a few years ago without the $1,000 price tag. Of course it has the Motorola customizable features beyond plane Android, added secure folders and the ability to interact with Windows base computers, particularly the ThinkPad. But even if you're not using it for these purposes, it is a great performing phone that does all the things that should do. The camera is very good, talk quality is good, the stereo speaker sound/quality is good, perhaps a bit more peak volume would be suggested in future rendition but still adequate. The biggest frustration is when searching for phones like this, Amazon does not discern and reviews what phone is being reviewed.

The last foldable phone I had was the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2. I liked it a lot but eventually grew tired of the heaviness and ended up selling it. I also found the tall, slim, remote control profile of the outer screen to be uncomfortable to use at times, not to mention its unwieldy reachability. Unfortunately, Samsung has chosen to stick with the tall, skinny, barely useable design of the outer screen. OnePlus, on the other hand, provides a normal size outer screen, much better hinge with almost no detectable crease when open, a larger screen and many say an even better camera (albeit a much more obtrusive one) than even the new Samsung Fold 6! And even though it does not have the IP48 submersible rating Samsung has or the wireless charging, it does come with a proprietory 67 watt fast charger in the box that allows it to charge the phone from zero to 100% in under 45 minutes. Neither Samsung nor the new Pixel Pro 9 foldable can achieve anywhere near that level of fast charging. And the OPO beats both of those products in battery life by a mile! It's a matter of personal preference of course but, for me, the OPO is the far superior choice . You may feel otherwise. Oh yeah, forgot to mention it's just as light to hold and carry around as the new Samsung Fold 6 despite having a wider outer screen and a bigger inner screen. And with 512 GB it is hundreds of dollars cheaper than a comparable new Samsung or Pixel foldable, especially with the trade-in deal OnePlus is offering. You should also know unfortunately, OnePlus is only offering three years of software updates for this phone and four years security updates, while Samsung is promising 7 years. But honestly, there's no way I'm going to hang on to this phone for three more years. I'll likely trade it in when the OnePlus Open 2 makes its debut next year or the year after.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tobey64', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Solid phone and price is great for what you get.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Oneplus open has stunning screens both outer and inner.

Nice that it comes with 512gb of storage that's going to be more than enough for me. I don't really care so much that the phones only rated for splashes as I never take it near water anyway. The other thing that's nice is how bright the screen gets out in bright sunlight. Very impressive. This phone no matter what I throw at it never gets hot.

Being several years old and the battery life getting ever worse, I decided it was time for a new phone.

For less money.  I decided to take a chance and ordered one.  I have had it for a week now and am very pleased with it.  It is, in fact, superior in every way to the Z Fold, which is a fine phone as well.  The battery life is, in fact, much better.  I also really appreciate the larger front screen.  Seems to be an upgrade in every other way as well.  When I took it to my local provider to activate and transfer all my data, the tech was very excited to see it.  He had read about it and was thinking of getting one but was hesitant to pull the trigger.  After seeing mine and playing with it a bit, he was sold and plans to order one.  He asked if he could show mine to his co-workers.  They were equally excited.A little bit of research and the willingness to take a chance paid off for me.

I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Wow!

Even the plastic bag which it came with stated so. When I powered the unit for the first time it had no problem booting to the setup screen which was in Spanish and indicated that its 5000mAh battery was 50% charged. Although it wasn\'t difficult to change the language to English, I decided to power it down and wait until it was fully charged before continuing with the setup. This took around 30 minutes to complete. I needed to completely transfer as much of my data, folder, contacts and apps from my old Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime to this Samsung Galaxy A25 5G so I used the free Samsung app from the Google Playstore to accomplish this. The transfer over wifi took a few hours and only left out 5 apps which were relatively unimportant and easilly reloaded to the new phone from the playstore.Trying to save a few bucks, I then tried to switch my sim card from the old phone to the new phone myself. I followed the online instructions provided by Metro by T-Mobile, but this is where I encountered a problem. The IMEI number was not recognized by Metro and suggested I call for assistance. I wondered if the negative comments about this phone not being truly unlocked and not working in North America were true, so I decided to stop at this point and just wait until I could visit the nearest Metro store for help.The following morning, I did so. To my surprise it only took all of under 5 minutes and at a cost of $26.78 for a new sim card plus an activation fee to have me out the door with my old phone number successfully transferred to the new phone. Since then, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G seems to be functioning just fine. I love how bright and clear the screen is. Its responsive and easy it is to use inspite of the fact that it is light years more advanced that my old one. I\'m still learning about all its innovations and how to use it properly. Imagine, within a day of receiving this new phone I went from a smartphone using Android 7.11 OS to Android 14 OS!!! Would anyone believe that had I not needed to switch to an an Android OS of 11+ just to be able to utilize my car\'s Andro Auto Infotainment System fully, I would still be using my old J7 Prime?!Though not as powerful as the latest Galaxy S or N models, its specs including it\'s screen, video and multi-camera resolutions, refresh rate, processing unit, tactile response and even its storage expandability are fairly impressive if not respectable at such an affordable prize. If down the road I find anything to dislike or complain about it, I\'ll be sure to write an addendum to this review. In a nutshell ... I can vouch that this phone works just fine with Metro by T-Mobile cellular carrier in Florida (or at least my neck of the woods, East Central Florida) and can make calls either over wifi or just using cellular data.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Katie', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A great phone!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone is truly a middle range device.

When I started doing some research, I noticed this deal, where I could get a top-of-the-line phone from 2 years ago for less than half price. Spec-wise, this device is equivalent to the s22 ultra with very minor exceptions (EXTREMELY minor, like camera and variable refresh rate).Comparing this device to all the current budget phones from Google, Apple, Samsung, Nord, Moto, TCL, etc., this device seems to be the best value for the price. Between the refresh rate, battery, AMOLED HDR display (boasting 1400 nits of brightness) , stereo speaker audio, 12gb ram, security/software updates (for at least another couple of years at the time of writing), this phone is absolutely killer.The refurbished part scared me at first, as I normally buy all my devices new, but I have no complaints here. My device genuinely feels brand new.My only complaints about this phone are mostly personal problems rather than the phone being faulty. For example, I kind of hate how clear the front-facing camera is. I may need to get new glasses or something, but the picture is more detailed than looking in the mirror. When I take a selfie, I see all the disgusting blemishes in high detail (I'll work on being less ugly, but regardless, it maybe something to note if you take a lot of selfies, you may need some software to blend the photos a little better).Another complaint is the jarring effect of the main camera trying to switch focus. I don't take very many pictures, but if you're trying to take a fast picture, that might be an issue.The display does not allow for 144hz and 1440p at the same time. It's kind of a bummer, but I'm just excited to finally leave my 60hz life behind.Opening a couple of games, this phone performs extremely well, but I did find it odd that it did not allow for higher graphics options on games like Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal, since it defaulted these games to high graphics rather than highest (not that I play waifu simulator or Diablo Immoral, but I did need to benchmark my credit card somewhere).Lastly, this may be just my shipment, but the cord did not work for transferring data from my old Note 8 to the S20. Fortunately, you can transfer everything wirelessly, and the cord I got works for fast charging. It's just an odd issue worth noting.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this device. I don't normally write reviews, but here I am writing a book on my experience with it, so maybe that's a testimony in itself. Hopefully this helps someone on-the-fence about picking this one up.Edit: this was purchased from Edge Cellular\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone, Display, Speed.

I bought this phone refurbished from them in, supposedly, excellent condition. Basically meaning that it wouldn\'t have any scratches on the back of the phone or on the screen. Unfortunately, the phone had very clear signs of image burn-in. This was disheartening, seeing as to how I paid for a higher amount to get a product in better condition. It wasn\'t even advertised anywhere on the listing that it would potentially have display issues, much less actual burn-in. I had contacted them on the issue, and apparently they\'re not able to offer replacements, they gave me a choice of returning in for a full refund or keeping for a small partial refund equal to the difference of their excellent condition and good condition phones. I ended up going with the partial refund, because fortunately, it doesn\'t get in the way of any of my use with it. I would not recommend buying from them.Product: Now for those who want to know about the product itself and whether or not to buy it. The display is incredible, even in 2023\'s standards. I use the phone at 120hz with the lower resolution because I don\'t watch much media on it and mainly use it for social and gaming.  It supports 120hz refresh rate at 1080p resolution and 60hz at 1440p. The display itself is another great part of the phone, the colors you get with it are just amazing.  It is an AMOLED display with HDR10, which really helps with contrast between your blacks and whites and entire color spectrum.The phone comes equipped with 12gb of ram, allowing for not only a stutter-less gaming experience, but also quick multi-tasking with apps. I\'ve really enjoyed the phone for the time I\'ve had it, it\'s quick with any task I try to use it for, not once have I had an app lag or slow down. The crisp screen and smooth motion gives the premium experience you\'d want with a more expensive phone. The only real downsides I could even think of saying about this device is that it is an older phone, so software support won\'t last too much longer as of the time of writing this review; and this display doesn\'t have some of the more modern feature that the newer Galaxy phones have, such as Dynamic Refresh Rate, which basically optimizes the phone\'s use of the 120hz refresh rate.Overall, I\'d recommend getting this phone over newer ones at the same price point and even older flagships, it\'s a great price for all that you get with it, premium user experience, feel, and the camera is amazing even with it being a few years old.Though, if you\'re buying it refurbished like I did, I don\'t recommend buying it from ""GreenTech Refurbished"".\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Santiago Villanueva Jesús', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 19, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es mi primera compra de un producto reacondicionado.

There is a small amount of easily removable bloatware on this, but otherwise, it\'s a very affordable phone that comes with a stylus.Connectivity is very good, in the typical Lenovo/Motorola fashion. This is a great phone if gaming is not your thing and if you don\'t need quirks like foldable displays or cameras with ""Samsung 100x space zoom."" It\'s simple, reliable, and has a GREAT price.The screen is very responsive, videos work flawlessly, and the photos from the 3 cameras (1 front, 2 rear) are excellent.The mounting of the stylus (just like the 2021 and 2022 versions) leaves something to be desired, as it WILL fall out at some point. To prevent the loss of said stylus, get a GOOD case like an OtterBox or a DBrand for this phone, and order and keep spare stylus pens on you if you use them a lot (for signing documents and editing photos). I really wish that would be re-located to the top of the phone instead of being stuffed into the bottom, but for most users who don\'t use the stylus, that\'s a moot point.I\'ve had several Motorola phones since 2019 (when the LG Stylo was discontinued), and they\'ve all been good. This is yet another one I can recommend.My biggest concern is that this phone is NOT waterproof or even water resistant. My first one got fried by humidity and lake water, so I ordered a second one to replace it. Don\'t believe the marketing about ""water repellent nano coating"", get a GOOD case to protect this phone if you\'re going out on the lake or into a thunderstorm.

Very responsive interface, no lag, no hiccups, fast stable wi-fi, good battery life, solid gps for navigation, and lots of internal storage and SD card slot.They had to cut somewhere to get the phone to $300 and that is evident in the ""feel"" and materials of the phone. It doesn\'t look cheap, but the body is plastic and the back does slightly vibrate when the speakers are turned up loud. It, however, does not effect the sound quality, which is decent. The lack of gorilla glass and limited amount of updates, might limit the lifespan of this phone, but in all honesty, most phones are replaced at least within 5 years due to software and technical advancements.You will have to spend some time removing bloatware, but once you have done that you have a nice clean UI.There are quite a few options at around this price range and I had a difficult time selecting a phone. What lead me to finally selecting the Moto G 5G stylus was its support for a large number of cellular bands around the world. If you are buying an unlocked phone, you want as many options for choosing a tel carrier at home or abroad. When you look into it, it\'s a bit shocking on how limited some phones are with regard to the number of bands available. Motorola seems to be one of the best and the Moto G 5G stylus 2023, in particular.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Johnny Extreme', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Second time trying a newer Motorola Android smartphone and I am actually impressed with how well these work compared to my usual Samsung, Google, and various other company experiences.

I was surprised by the high-quality cardboard packaging, the contents consisting of a telephone, charging cable, tool for the card slot, a short operating manual and even a transparent soft cover with a pleasant feel. Since I was “catapulted” from Android 8 (my old Huawei) to Android 12 in the Blackview, I first looked for information about Android 12 on the Internet before setting it up, which later turned out to be helpful (and in my opinion also represents a user manual ).

On my old Huawei, the recognition was on the back in the upper third, which is an advantage in my opinion. But I knew that when I ordered it and I\'ll definitely get used to it.\ufeffCredit goes to customer service who I contacted with a technical question. It gets the rating “5 stars” from me. The service employee who advised me was personal, friendly and competent and emails were answered the next day at the latest.\ufeffConclusion: Anyone who buys a phone will first consider which claims and requirements should be covered. The Blackview A 53 clearly exceeded my price-performance expectations. It makes a high-quality impression and meets my requirements: calling and taking photos in good quality, navigation and Bluetooth reliably, speed on the network and image structure/brightness as well as storage capacity of 64 GB are absolutely sufficient for me. If this is then supported by remarkable customer service, then the whole thing is “highly recommended” in my opinion.""\nRead more'}]",,,TB-24-Y-A53-Black-Q,Black,,"USB Type C, 3.5mm Jack",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

You can search online that issue.Tests I did show that the touchscreen responds when the finger is actually is not touching the screen but is 0.5- 1mm ( 1/52"" - 2/52"") away from it!This leads of course to an absurd overreaction when you handle the phone, even with the palm protection on, it reacts unintentionally. Often even it responses before you have actually touched anything simply because you moved your finger without touching the screen!Then there is the OS, by now Android 14. Another effort to overload an overdo many functions and poorly organize them. all of course in the eternal other obsession ""security"". The [settings] interface is not intuitive and straightforward anymore like it used to be in older android OSs.Whereas like in earlier versions you could customize and prioritize which icon functions you wanted where, that no longer seems to be possible.And then of course the confirmation pop-up window mania.Say you want to turn something off or delete a message/email. You have to go on a regular basis through three confirmations! DUH? Say you select an email or SMS and click on delete, then it asks you first if you want to delete it, and then and then again were you wanted deleted to and finally you need to confirm that! Really? Seriously?notwithstanding that the new and improved absolutely outlandish privacy terms and all other terms all of them with their 10,000 links to other terms about terms and privacy etc. blah blah... I really feel being raped on a daily basis.Furthermore for some reason despite larger screen all the fonts are smaller but layout spacing is larger with more wasted space. (yes I tried the font sizing). Total useless another feature is, that you can choose from an endless variety of different fonts...Any app you start needs a gazillion confirmations requesting permission to give access to this and that, here and there etc. etc. Overall straightforward sensible layout of the interface and functionality is gone.Here\'s a personal comparison and experience.Before I upgraded to this phone I had a Samsung S5 with OS Android 6.01. Everything worked fine I never had an issue SMS and MMS sent out instantaneously and everything else worked. Of course with new apps the phone became, aside from artificial incompatibilities, slower and slower. P part of a marketing ploy probably.Now I have a Samsung A14 5G with Android 14. MMS take much longer and needs two or three confirmations...And when executing a functioning in an app, next time I open the app I have to navigate back as it doesn\'t go back like previously by default.There\'s more but that would take up too much space to writeup here.Remember the peaceful relaxed time when we had a Bell telephone and a typewriter?We were able to communicate and even managed to fly two men to the moon and bring them safely back...\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Internetsuperstar', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best Phone Deal—Galaxy A14 5G is a Game Changer', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Let me tell you, folks, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G—factory unlocked, 64GB, black, renewed—is an absolute steal.

I'm not picky, so they've always been on the budget side. Always had to replace because of internal storage limitations and/or battery issues from long-term use. This time around, I decided to plunge for a budget-level Samsung, as I've enjoyed my experience with one of their GalaxyBooks over the last year. Loved the A14 5G at first, it's a major step-up for me in all of the specs. Or so I thought. After having it for six weeks, I just dropped it about 2.5 feet from counter to linoleum floor. Landed face down in a case, but I didn't think much of it as I've dropped old phones from much higher distances onto concrete and simply picked them up and kept going. Not so with this phone, whose screen went black and left me unable to interact with it. Force restart caused it to vibrate, so the internals are still working, but the screen is just dead. Never dropped it before, and never in my life have I had a phone screen quit on me, let alone after such a minor incident. After growing frustrated with lack of response and research that yielded there's probably nothing to do but replace the screen (which would cost more than I paid for this phone), I smacked the screen in frustration and wow - screen cracked.

This one being foldable easily fits.  There were some big differences in this phone compared to all of my previous cell phones.  For starters, there is no phone jack. Not a deal breaker if you have Blue Tooth ear buds.  Second big difference, there is no slot of a micro SD memory card.  I worked around that by buying a phone with 128 G of internal memory.  That\'s more than enough for all of my music, games, photos and apps.  The third big difference is there are 2 batteries, and they aren\'t easy to replace.  Instead of just removing a cover, there is some disassembly involved to get to them.  I may leave that to the ""Pros"" when the time comes to replace them.  There are tons of videos out there demonstrating all of the features of this phone, so I won\'t go into detail about it.  I will say that I watched a few of them to tweak some display and battery settings to extend the life of the battery such at limiting the percentage of charges.  I just found out it\'s not good on a battery when you charge it 100%.  Didn\'t know that before.  For you Tracfone users, I will confirm that you can take this unlocked phone to Tracfone, put your sim card from your old phone in it, and with a little help from a Tracfone tech, be ready to use it in under 15 minutes.  I thought I needed a Tracfone Sim card kit, and I didn\'t.  In the past I had to wait a few hours up to a day for the new phone to be fully functional - not this time.  Like I said, within 15 minutes it was working.  I wear a hearing aid, and once I configured the phone to work with my hearing aid app, it used the Bluetooth to send audible notifications to my hearing aid.  My wife is thrilled she doesn\'t have to hear my phone announce email and phone calls while we watch TV. I can also play music on my phone and hear it through my hearing aid.  Cool!  I\'m 76 years old, and I found this phone relatively intuitive in its operation.  It only took me a day or two of playing with it to learn my way around.  So far I like it.  I ordered screen protectors and a case to give it protection.  As a renewed cell phone it arrived in excellent shape, like new.  UPDATE 7/8/24  I did find one thing I really don\'t like about the Android 14 operating system - it\'s very difficult to turn on the Data setting.  It\'s a convoluted path to reach a setting that offers only 1 option, to keep ""data turned on when wi-fi isn\'t available"" all of the time. For someone who uses prepaid Tracfone services that don\'t have unlimited data, I have to limit my usage of data.  It took me a half hour to find directions how to access that setting, not fun!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sharistarshine', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Don't Buy It!!!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I loved the concept of a flip smartphone & maybe a new one would work properly but we've tried two of these refurbished ones & within 6 months they end up with a green line down the side & eventually a black blob that covered most of the screen.

It looked like a new phone, couldn\'t find a single sign it had been used. The plastic film was still on the back and sides. For the price it was a great buy. I cant see spending more than a few hundred dollars on one and this was in the $250 area total. There are a couple things I don\'t care for but have nothing to do with it being ""renewed"". The battery life leaves a bit to be desired. My last couple phones all had batteries in the 5000mA range so this having only a 3300mA battery is very noticeable, no more lasting all day and charging at night while sleeping like I\'ve been doing for years with my Moto G Stylus 5G phones(2021&2023 models).I\'m used to using the tempered glass screen protectors which can\'t be used on this one. I\'ve tried a couple of the flexible film ones with it but wasted the money because couldn\'t get them to install properly(without air bubbles everywhere). The phone screen is soft. It will get dents/creases in it if not careful(I put a light crease in mine trying to install a screen protector).  When opened its not perfectly flat, there\'s a shallow area where the fold is but it\'s not  visually noticeable with the screen on at all. Only noticeable by touch and visually when the screen is off. The non expandable memory isn\'t a feature I like. 128GB isn\'t a whole lot nowadays, especially when it\'s common for apps to be 1GB-3GB(like games and Facebook). I used to keep my games, photos, and entertainment/social media apps on a SD card but now I\'m just being a lot more selective with what I install and quick to uninstall something if it\'s not being used regularly, whereas with expandable memory I\'d just leave them on the SD card. I read that it will no longer receive updates from Samsung so Android 14 is going to be the last operating system upgrade for it.Size is the reason I bought it. Got tired of carrying phones that only fit in back pockets and still have 1/4 of it sticking out. With this I get the same size screen but can put it in any pocket.

Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

But anyways, i was excited but nervous at the same time because i was worried that it may have scratches, or it’s not gonna work properly, but once it was delivered that Thursday morning, i was super amazed.

Amazon refused to honor replacement arrangement.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I received the phone within 2 days of ordering. The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement.

The data from my other phone - apps, contacts, saved files, etc. - transfered quickly and smoothly and I was up and running in no time. The processor is very fast, the cameras are crisp and calls are clear. The battery only lasts 2 days - not as long as some other phones - but I am never far from power. So, I don't mind. But the best part of this phone was the price. At under $100, it fit my very tight budget.Not gonna lie, I bought this same phone from a different seller for about $40 less before I bought this phone. What a nightmare! I'll just say that the phone didn't work... AT ALL and I had to return it. Then, I bought this phone from this seller. The description for this phone was clear, complete, it answered all my questions and a few I didn't even know I needed to ask. Most importantly, it was honest. No information was omitted whether it was important or trivial and nothing was misrepresented. The phone I received is, and works, precisely as it was described - unlike the previous phone from the other seller.  This seller, unknowingly, turned a bad experience into a good one. For that, I am very grateful. The Moto One Ace may not be the phone for everyone, but this seller definitely is. You can trust that you will get the products they describe, just as they describe them.

It has a generally slower processor, so it won't outcompete much of the flagship phones of today, or its time, as it was released in 2021, but it is a solid phone with an outstanding battery life, which is the main reason that makes this a phone to buy.

I\'ve got lots more apps I can use. The trouble is that the thing is WAY too sensitive. If you touch it, it comes on to tell you the time. Can\'t figure out how to make it stop doing that. If I carry it in my pocket I\'ll wind up with 5-10 apps opened up when I thought it was on standby. I had to put in my fingerprint to start up and now if my wife wants to answer the phone she has to come borrow my finger to get into the thing. If I\'m watching a video and the phone rings, I dare not miss the answer button or the phone goes away I don\'t know where. I admit it, I\'m 70 years old and millenial Chinese phone designers have no idea what is an intuitive operating system for someone like me. I anticipate a long long learning curve.  Also, the charger/PC port uses an odd size plug rather than the standard C plug my old phones, my camera and other stuff use and I can\'t find an adapter from their so I have to carry around the cord if I don\'t want to risk the phone dying and leaving me stranded without even an Uber call I can make. Woe is me if I lose that cord. I\'ll probably have to buy a dozen of them cause sure as the sun rises, I\'m going to lose several before it\'s all over. I\'m going to have to go full Bluetooth for headphones because after a week the headphone jack won\'t let me fully plug the phone jack in. I\'ll have to live with it\'s quirks. I can\'t afford to wait for it to be repaired. I don\'t want to set up another one (I spent a week figuring the thing out), and I need my phone. There are some things I\'m happy with. If I can just consistently answer a phone call without the thing losing the phone screen, I\'ll probably be okay.

Also, since it came out in 2021 as 5G was advertising, it has all the 4G fixings that some cellular companies denied phones for not having even when they had 4G.  Additionally, it has a radio built with several country's radio frequencies as selections, meaning you could visit a lot of different countries and simply use the phone as a portable radio player without even connecting it to cellular service.  It's not a HAM radio, but for a phone, it's pretty nice.Glass: Gorilla Glass 5 on both the inside and outside.  Looking into glass quality, today's nice phones should have Gorilla Glass Victus.Curiosities: A flip phone with cameras on both sides and can be closed and put upside down which makes both cameras unable to gain any picture - you watch these movies of this or that specialist breaking into a phone and looking through the camera... not on an upside flip phone, lol.  Guess that's why it's not in the movies.Hardware: The phone 'could' handle 3GB of RAM, but Google would not put Android 11 Go on any phone that had more than 2GB of RAM, so the CAT s22 has the cap of 2GB of RAM.  The storage included is 16 GB, while the hardware can handle 128 GB MicroSD card, preferably the SanDisk High Endurance memory as specifically noted in other CAT phone documentation I read.  When this 128 GB MicroSD card of SanDisk High Endurance memory is used, the choice to use it as an external memory source(not encrypted) or as part of the phone memory(safer because it is encrypted) becomes a choice of yours.  Most apps and games and games will not run on the MicroSD card, but some will.  The app game works like this, install the app, login, download whatever you use, then close the app, move it to storage and see if it keeps working(Do NOT do this to apps you need, like your Firewall).  If it stops working when you try to run it, or when you try to run it after a restart, then it needs internal memory.Battery:  The battery is not much smaller than the screen size, which is what you want today's smartphone battery to be, the size of the screen.  Bluetooth is probably going to eat battery... certainly wouldn't be the first phone to do that to.  An unfirewalled phone will eat some battery, so the efforts to get your firewall down as tight as you can comfortably run it is worth it for the life of your battery.  Battery saver should probably always be on, and some apps use more battery playing voice or music than others.  The ESV Bible app, when playing voice, eats battery.  Still, that Kristyn has one of the most amazing voices I've never paid for.  It's definitely one of the best voices I've ever heard, easily the quality of the best voices I have paid for.  The battery is user replaceable.Operating System Updates:  The two most popular lines of CAT update for 3 years, counting the year they come out.  A phone that comes out in 2018 will have at least one update in 2020 - in my experience.  However, the Cat s22 was not one of these 2 popular lines.  The Cat s22 released in 2021 and updated into the middle of 2022.Keyboard: A lot of wimpering has been made on this keyboard.  The screen is fully touchscreen, and so that while the Kika(the physical keypad) and the Gboard are installed, the Gboard is set as default.  Simply set the Kika as the default keypad, and then go into settings and turn off the soft keypad display.  You'll find the Kika keyboard is very space efficient, definitely has a dictionary built in to guess words you haven't finished typing, and doesn't like spaces.  Wait, what?  My Japanese dictionary said Kika was a sunflower(rare)... so... that makes as much sense as anything else.  Japanese doesn't use spaces, it uses particles where spaces are.  That is to say, if you press the space button, the Kika's guesses clear, and it starts over.  However, space-less sentences the Kika is very good at.  Or, if you happen to be going for minimalism, and figure if you know enough words, one word should always do, the Kika has got you covered.  What about the choices in the Google Play Store?  There are three T9 keyboards in the Google Play store.  One is from France, one is from England(Tappy), and one is from India.  The most glitchy option is the one everyone recommends(Old T9), primarily because it works with the physical keyboard.  Each of the T9 keyboards has a different set of language options, though I find Tappy's option including the gaelics Irish, Scots Gaelic, and Welsh, as well as other languages, the most interesting.  Japanese is available from the T9 keypad from France, but it seems to me that Tappy is the T9 option most cared for by the developer.  That said, Tappy doesn't appear to work with the physical keypad, or if it does, I don't know how to do it, so Kika will do - because it is not glitchy like Old T9 is.  Also, dice passwords from dmuth would be ideal using the Kika keyboard with something like KeePassDX + Donate.  You could easily use it for a password chain of 8 words without spaces insanely fast with the Kika keyboard.  That is, your KeePass password database could feasibly be safer because of the Kika keyboard than on your laptop.Compatibility: Most everything runs on this... save a few oddities... like Bible Apps?  I mean, just for the craziest test, I installed the MMORPG Elemental Knights R Platinum, logged in(after I finally figured out how to make an account so it worked other place besides one phone - hint, the real username that is not shown is a random hexadecimal combination) and after I moved it to internal memory, it worked.  Here I am, on a 2.8 inch touch screen, logging into an MMORPG successfully.  Then OliveTree Bible doesn't work.  Explain that to me?  If you have this phone and want to memorize scripture from the Holman CSB, then the Audio Christian Standard Bible, The Bible Memory App(You might prefer Fighter Verses to this one), and Bible Memory: VerseLocker would be a good trio of apps to own.  eSword: Bible Study to Go and ESV Bible work well on the CAT s22 also.  Especially with the 128 GB MicroSD SanDisk High Endurance, the need for space for CDs you imported from the laptop is ever present.  Use Neutron Player and you can play .flac audio files on the CAT s22.Bloatware: This phone has bloatware, but not the sort that eats all your storage space, rather the sort that has no battery optimization options.  There were 20 apps on my CAT s22 with no battery optimization options after all updates.  The easiest solution is a Firewall, such Glasswire, or InviZible.  Limit the apps that are allowed to communicate and your battery will be a LOT happier.  There is no need to change permissions.  You can choose what talks using the Firewall.Security: I run DNScrypt 24/7.  The website and everyone else can know I'm coming when I get there, I don't need a sign on my back while traveling.  It's a phone, though, they aren't high security.  The apple phone that had a fingerprint hacked was by someone who looked at pictures of the person on the internet who owned the phone until he found one that included a good picture of their finger.  Ecryption is always CBC on storage.  I mean, sure, you can set the memory card as part of the phone memory, run DNScrypt, get the firewall tighter - by maybe starting with limiting system apps that anti spy mobile pro flags, tighten your web browsers down a bit, use SilentNotes, and use Threema to talk to family... but the rest of the advertising is smoke and mirrors.  (I find my comfort allowed system minimums with this Cat s22 using InviZible firewall are 1.Carrier Services, 2.Chrome, 3.DNS(R), 4.Gmail, 5.Google Go, 6.Google Play Store, 7.Google Play Services(GSF), 8.Internet Connectivity Check(R), 9.Meet, 10.Messages, 11.T-Mobile, 12.TDC, 13.YouTube,14.com.android.server.networkpermissionconfig(R) , though your comfort allowed system minimums may vary.)Annoyances:  The throttling sometimes causes issues.  Particularly if I am putting it through it's paces because it's a new phone to me and I want everything installed, logged in, and working by the weekend.  I went from an 8core with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB RAM for app storage to this CAT s22, a 4core with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB RAM for most app storage.  It's a little different, but there is something nice about a flip phone.  Now if I can just convince Kika that spaces are Kika's friends.Camera:  The display is 4:3 (480p, 640Hx480W), front & rear have 640x480 4:3 options(ratio=ratio, so proper display), however front & rear also have 16:9 higher resolution options marked as 4:3 options.  It may be an image edit(app or desktop) away from a presentable picture, or simply mistaken notes.  This wouldn't be the first 'oops' where ratio was mistakenly recorded wrongly giving mysteriously weird pictures that are only a simple fix away.NFC: there is no tap the phone to pay option on this phone - as my prior phone had this, which was a feature that was as unnerving as it was convenientApp Default Screen Limits: 6 apps on screen, 4 apps on quick app barApps that have worked for me:  ibisPaint, Stop Motion Studio PRO, Space Weather, Facts, Concise ISL(the screen never needs to be touched for this one - the thoughtfulness of testing that went into this app is easy to see when it works so nicely with the number keypad - the speaker button shifts the location the arrow buttons control from), Fighter Verses, Visible Body Physiology & Pathology, Audio Christian Standard Bible, Threema(chat works fine - i am having some odd issue with pics I upload into chat displaying, but it might be a setting I have wrong), Asahi Kanji, Ap Beibl, Anti Spy Mobile Pro, AIDA64, Audible, Microsoft Authenticator, Avery Cat, Bandcamp, Beginner's Go, Bioball, Biobla, Braille Tutor, Brightwheel, Caoga Caoga, Caustic 3, Privacy Cell, Crunchyroll, Crypto-Encryption Tools, Cwrs Mynediad, Cwrs Sylfaen, Docs To Go, e-Sword, Easy Thai Read, Elemental Knights Online Platinum, ESV Bible, Exploding Kittens, FreeBSD Doc, FreeBSD Handbook, HamStudy, HP Prime Pro(seriously, the keys are too small on this one, this is for a seven year old's enjoyment), iBless Torah, Judo Reference (Paid), Collins Irish Dictionary, JA Audiobook Learn Japanese, Kanji Quest, Kanji Tree, 'Kanji, Kana' (Readings of Chinese Characters... 300MB), KeePassDX, KeePro Unlocker, Kobo Books, Lamh Time, Learn CSS - Pro, Learn HTML - Pro, Learn Javascript - Pro, Level 22, Morse Code Practice Oscillator, Morse Trainer, Nemo Irish, Nemo Japanese, Neutron Player, Photo Editor (dev.macgyver), PlayerPro Music Player (Pro) (this plays videos you import), Pixiv Sketch, Pocket Mathematics, Pocket Physics, Posing App, Prime Video, Reddit, Remind, RPG Scribe, RPG Simple Dice PLUS, Ships Lights(well, the whole collection - there's 3), Kanazawa Shogi 2, SilentNotes, Sketch a Day, Skype, Survival Manual, Taekwondo Forms, The Chess - Crazy Bishop, Turnlehrer @home | gymnastics , Tumblr, Uciana(Kittens Game too), Bible Memory: VerseLocker, VRM Posing Mobile, WhatsApp, WHRMeter, Winzip, Word Games PRO (100+ games in one app), Yahoo Mail Go, ザ\u3000花札, ラジオFM日本Practical Memory: Stay less than 10GB of the 12GB of app space available to prevent automatic triage deleting by the phone software.  Use SD Maid and SD Maid Key to keep your phone purring.Perfect apps:  Concise ISL (Irish Sign Language), Magi Ann series (Learn Welsh), eSword  - these work with the physical keyboard well.  Nemo Language Apps do work fully with the physical keyboard, but the clicking to do so is not intuitiveNote:  running i2p purple along with dnscrypt breaks Tumblr.  dnscrypt alone does not.The bottom line is there's enough smartphone here to use apps, but a small screen without small fingers can make it more useful as a device for audio books, music, and talking to human beings - although it certainly does receive spam calls as well as any other phone.  My child regularly plays this or that video game on this phone, particularly Avery Cat(Every Cat: Match3 link) and Level 22, and those small fingers are perfect for this phone.  I press a few times to get my audiobook playing.  Still, as Gorilla Glass 5 is on $500 US phones in stores today... I tend to look at other phones and then hold onto this phone.  Of course, my child is eagerly waiting for the day I get another phone... because she wants this one.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazonian', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Love this thing', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Got this because I was tired of carrying around a boring rectangle and also wanted to stop mindlessly scrolling.  It\'s *just* smart enough that it will run the few apps I need (bank app, MFA, email) while otherwise working like an old dumb phone.But this is no dumb phone.  I can do just about everything I could do on my old rectangle with this.  Yeah, it\'s a little slower, the screen is smaller, and you have to type things out in tap/T9, but the latter two are features as far as I\'m concerned.The great thing about this phone is that, if I need to, I can do anything I could do with my old phone, but it\'s *just* annoying enough that I don\'t want to make a habit out of it.If you\'re a social media addict, this phone is not for you.  (Again, a feature from my view).  If you\'re looking to downsize to something that\'s not a time/attention suck but can\'t give up a few necessary apps, this is definitely for you.Pros:- Great for digital detox while still allowing access to apps you have to have- Feels way more comfortable in your hand compared to the boring, cookie-cutter rectangles- Screen is surprisingly crisp and readable for being portrait-oriented VGA.  (480x640)- Browsing the web is surprisingly snappy and fluid (used FF mobile and Chrome)- The programmable key can be used to toggle the flashlight- Good call quality.  Supports VoLTE and VoWiFI (at least it does on T-Mobile)- Solid build, water resistant (haven\'t tested), and durable- Physical keys- Has GPS, and map apps work- Most apps seem to just work even though this is Android Go instead of vanilla Android. The few apps that didn\'t work just didn\'t work correctly on the small screen (most apps scaled just fine).- WiFi hotspot works (may be carrier dependent; my plan allows it).- Supposedly unlockable bootloader.  I\'m buying a second one of these to experiment with custom ROMS; hopefully a newer version of Android can work since these come with, and are stuck at, Android 11.- Minimal bloatware.  I disabled pretty much all of the default/Google apps and replaced them with better alternatives from F-Droid.  The only pre-installed app that cannot be disabled (without rooting, anyway) is the T-Mobile app.Meh:- Speaker is just okay.  You\'d think with the space available it would be a little better.  Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to write home about.- The default Google apps aren\'t really optimized for the small screen.  Google Maps, in particular, with its ridiculous amount of clutter was frustrating to use (granted, it\'s become frustrating to use even on a larger phone).  Installed Organic Maps from F-Droid, and problem solved.  GPS seems accurate and even works indoors.Cons:- Camera is not great.  It\'s a little better than the cameras on flip phones of yore, but don\'t expect anything like you\'re used to with even the worst smartphones.  It\'s basically an afterthought.  If you\'re in broad daylight, they\'ll probably turn out okay.  If you\'re inside without full illumination, you\'re better off committing the moment to memory than trying to capture it with this.- Dead end device.  Bullitt, the manufacturer of these, left the phone market in early 2024.  All CAT phones were made by them, and these are the last of them.  It has two updates (which it should check for during initial setup), but after that, it\'s stuck in time on Android 11.  Which is really sad because I love this thing, and it\'s truly one of a kind.- Programmable key is limited in what it can be programmed to do.  It\'s also not recognized by the KeyMapper app.  Long pressing it can do one of a few pre-programmed actions or launch an app. Double-clicking it can do a bit more, but that is the only action which can turn on the flashlight, so I leave it on that.- Outer screen is very low resolution and sometimes the indicators are cropped off.  Also, sometimes the outer screen will show a really tiny, low-res version of the inner screen when you close the phone (will \'reset\' to the proper status display if you press a volume button or the programmable button).- The default launcher does not allow adding web apps to home screen.  I thought this was an Android Go limitation at first, but after replacing the default launcher with a different one, that functionality became available.- The default T9 keyboard annoyingly does not remember the last mode you had it in.  I tend to use tap mode for most things, but it always defaults to T9 English despite showing ""Abc"" mode.  Replaced that with Traditional T9 from F-Droid.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Helena', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on June 13, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Lamentablemente la primera vez que recibí el aparato el micrófono no servía y lo tuvimos que devolver.Lo volvimos a comprar y llegó muy rápido y funciona perfectamente.

I really needed a mid tier phone with a good quality camera. I take pictures of products for work and need stunning images, so this was the #1 most important feature to me... and I\'m blown away. These are near-flagship quality images for a fraction of the price. Here are some images I took with it:1. A comparison between my older Moto G Stylus 5G (left) and the A54 (right). I consider the Moto G to have a pretty decent camera and I\'ve taken some stunning shots with it, but this is a level up. Notice that the Moto G really struggles with underexposure of the subject when trying to compensate for the brightly lit window behind it. The A54 photo is definitely overexposed in that spot too, but the main subject doesn\'t lose any detail.2. Same 2 pictures but zoomed in. The loss of fine detail and underexposure is even more apparent in the Moto G Stylus photo. The A54 photo is crisp and retains some fine details here which is impressive.3. 3:4 50MP mode.4. Same photo, zoomed in. The resolution here is phenomenal. If you zoom in even further, you can see the individual pixels on the can label.5. Macro mode. Again the fine detail here is stunning.6-8: 3:4 50MP mode. Notice the clarity, fine detail, vividness and crispness of these images. I love how vivid the colors are.9. 32MP selfie camera. This camera is powerful and picks up details I\'m not sure I even want it to, to be honest. Thankfully, though, it also has the skin smoothing effect to mitigate this. 32MP on a selfie camera in general is new to me and very impressive.Overall I give this phone\'s camera a 9.5/10. The only thing it lacks is a telephoto lens, but I wouldn\'t expect this in a $325 phone. Also, some of the images do come out slightly oversaturated which could be a problem if you want ""natural"" looking, slightly less vivid photos. Personally, though, I actually prefer this vibrant, enhanced look, so for my needs it\'s a straight up 10/10.Now that I\'ve written an entire novel on this phone\'s camera, which is probably the most underrated aspect of anything in the world of consumer electronics today, let\'s talk briefly about the phone itself.1. I love that it\'s IP67 water resistant. I do not plan to test this, but I\'ve ruined many phones by dropping them in the toilet or taking them in the rain so I like that I don\'t have to worry as much about that.2. Battery life is decent. Today, I charged it overnight to 100%. I had a video call with my therapist and after that I\'ve been editing images on full brightness for a few hours. Then I wrote this review, which took like 45 minutes. I have not plugged it in again and at 4:30pm, I still have 68%. This is impressive.3. Love the size. My Moto G Stylus 5G was a bit too big to hold comfortably in my hand. This phone is just a tad bit smaller and easier to hold, but still has a big beautiful display.4. The awesome purple color is just the cherry on top of an amazing phone.Overall: Vastly underrated phone for a phenomenal price.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Erika Ovalle', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Good quality up-to-date phone for 5G needs.

I just wanted to say that the A54 version WORKS ON SPECTRUM MOBILE. That was not totally clear when purchasing. Pro tip: if you're not sure, check the IMEI number printed on the box BEFORE OPENING. I was able to verify the IMEI number on Spectrum's website, and just swapping in her previous SIM card, everything worked. Since Spectrum uses the Verizon network, I assume this means it would also work with Verizon, but use the IMEI trick with any carrier to verify first.

Frankly, you won't notice what's missing. I will say, if having wireless charging is a deal breaker for you, this is not the phone for you, as it doesn't have it.  Like all Samsung phones it was a little annoying to set up with all the little settings you want to customize, but it's made infinitely easier with the Smart Switch app, which will move *most* of your apps and settings over.The camera is really great, sound quality for music and voice is good.  Some people have had difficulty hearing me when I have it on speaker, but I think that's more a deficit of the room I am in when using that method of calling.  Using an ear bud, or going into another room, solves that.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it in my hand, as it's a little thicker and squarer than the S series phones. It's not off-putting, though, just different.The lavender color makes it attractive and is only available in retail versions, not from your carrier or even Samsung itself.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'nicolas cobo', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'reliable and cost effective cell phone!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I gave this phone to my mom as a birthday gift, and it works like a charm, Its very reliable and good quality, the price is also very attractive.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'R.

Prima di decidermi all\'acquisto, ho scartabellato avanti e indietro le pagine web dedicate all\'argomento e, dopo aver scartato prodotti con prestazioni stratosferiche, utili solo al prezzo del prodotto, mi sono concentrato sulla fascia media che, per come uso io il cellulare, è quella che mi interessa. Vagabondando a destra e a manca, tra specifiche dei prodotti e relative recensioni, mi sono convinto ad acquistare questo Blackview Color 8 che sembrava soddisfare le mie esigenze.Il prodotto è arrivato nella sua scatola, racchiusa in un cartone Amazon, perfettamente sigillata a garanzia del prodotto intonso. Al suo interno ho trovato il cellulare già parzialmente carico e racchiuso in una cover antiurto, una plastica per proteggere lo schermo, il caricabatterie con il cavetto usb C e un manualino multilingue che può fungere da guida alla prima accensione.Prima accensione e, per me, PANICO! Collegato il telefono alla rete elettrica per evitare problemi durante la migrazione dei dati dal vecchio cellulare, dopo l\'impostazione della lingua e la password di Google, arriva il momento di collegare il cellulare al wi-fi. Impostato l\'SSID e inserita la password relativa, tappo la casella ""prosegui"" e, a quel punto, il sistema mi dice che ha trovato il nome della rete ma che non può accedere a internet. Riprovo e... stesso risultato. A questo punto mi chiedo come mai; eppure possiedo un tablet sempre della Blackview con cui la procedura ha funzionato correttamente, come ha funzionato sempre correttamente con apparecchiature di altra marca. PANICO! ""ecco, mi è arrivato un prodotto difettoso che non si collega al wi-fi, cosa faccio? Lo restituisco? Telefono all\'assistenza e magari mi rispondono in inglese?..."" CALMA! Ci riprovo. Questa volta mi accorgo che sul tastierino alfanumerico con il quale inserisco la password di rete, in basso a destra, c\'è un simbolino di spunta verde al quale non avevo fatto caso. Speranza!... sarà mica che invece di ""prosegui"", bello evidenziato in azzurro, devo tappare quello?... Sii, questa volta si collega senza problemi e scarico le mie tensioni accumulate con relativi improperi, contro chi ha pensato di non includere la validazione della password nel tasto ""prosegui"". Dopodichè tutto è filato liscio e ho trasferito i dati essenziali, foto e quant\'altro dal mio vecchio cell al nuovo.Quello che mi ha lasciato stupito del nuovo acquisto è la quantità di impostazioni che si possono configurare, non ultime quelle di poter limitare la carica massima della batteria tra il 70% e il 90% per non rovinarla troppo in fretta e la possibilità di scalare le dimensioni dei caratteri. Il sensore di riconoscimento dell\'impronta digitale, posto sul fianco destro, funziona alla perfezione, cosa che ritengo importantissima per la quantità di siti che ormai richiedono l\'accesso tramite impronta (Spid, Io, banca, ecc.). Per il resto, trovo il telefono reattivo, con schermo di ottime dimensioni (6,75""), batteria con buona durata, e comparto fotografico dignitoso... e qui bisogna ricordare che un cellulare non è una macchina fotografica e che quindi mi fanno ridere quelli che decantano le meraviglie delle foto scattate con un oggetto che scannerizza ciò che inquadra contro una macchina che scatta le immagini tramite otturatore.Nel complesso, lo giudico un ottimo prodotto per la fascia di prezzo in cui è inserito, e mi sento di consigliarlo, oltre a chi è perennemente su chat e giochini vari, anche a chi, come me ne fa un uso pratico ormai imprescindibile nella vita di tutti i giorni... telefonate comprese.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Simone', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on August 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""L'ho preso per mio figlio.

I will try to be detailed as I know I read hundreds of reviews before finally feeling secure with my purchase, so hopefully I can help someone out here.The box it arrived in was old and dirty so I was extremely nervous to open it, but once I did I was very impressed. The phone itself was in phenomenal, like new condition. I was very happy to see everything included in the box (sim key ejector, charging cable, plug in adapter) so that was great since some of the reviews I read said parts were not included or missing, ect.The phone needed to be charged right away, and as soon as I plugged in it, the included wall adapter started making a very high pitched buzzing sound, so I swapped it out with a different adapter I already had on hand (you can get them anywhere so not a big deal) and problem was instantly solved.I am completely unfamiliar with Samsung phones, so I was worried about set up, but once I was easily able to change the language from Spanish to English, it was pretty easy to do.I really liked how crisp and clear the graphics were and the phone has a great screen size for gaming. I will say that in my opinion the phone is pretty laggy in loading, but my 12 year old doesn’t really seem to mind and after pretty much living on it for the past two days, it’s safe to say he loves the phone.It took some doing to familiarize ourselves with it, and found it was not as user friendly as an iPhone, but once you figure out how to actually gets the apps on the Home Screen and change the clock, ect, you’re good to go.Pros: great screen size, clear graphics, amazing battery life, 12 year old approved.Cons: A little laggy, not the most user friendly until you get used to it, weird buzzing adaptor.Note: we have not tried installing a SIM card as of yet, so I can’t attest to that.So far this phone has been great, well worth the purchase price, and my son is extremely happy with it, so for that, I would absolutely recommend it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gabriela V.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on February 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Puse a cargare el celular y el cargador se calento muchisimo estubo a punto de explotar o tener un corto circuito en la casa.\nRead more'}]",1.2GHz Cortex A8 Processor,,Galaxy A13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

Main camera almost always makes something blurry. The 200mp is better, but not perfect. Honestly it may have something to do with the default camera software not being very good.

The top camera (for close-range shots) is super clear, but the bottom one (for zoomed out shots) is on the fuzzier side, unfortunately.- High storage: having 256 GB really set aside my worries with going overboard on my photo gallery.- Great aesthetics: whoever designed it did a wonderful job cause it\'s probably the prettiest phone I\'ve owned to date.Cons:- Doesn\'t show any call indicators, so I can\'t just ""tap into"" my ongoing call. Instead, I have to go into my phone app in order to view the call or visit the App Vault, which can be annoying.- Xiaomi transfer between phones didn\'t work the best; I\'ll probably have to get a usb-c to -c cable to connect my two phones to successfully transfer all the loose ends.Overall, I think this is a really great phone with neat features, and has made me excited for future iterations of the Redmi Note series.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Romario G.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing functionality battery and connectivity', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The device is amazing.

As mentioned in the edit above, the back panel does not seem to be glued on fully, but if you get a case that isn\'t an issue (which you should anyway, considering the phone is entirely made of glass). The camera is blurry which I think is due to the slightly noticeable smudge on the inside of the glass covering the cameras. Besides these two issues though, this is probably better than getting a cheap modern phone for the same price, and I\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a great phone.Another note, anyone who owns this device should definitely go into the settings app and turn on high motion smoothness in Settings -> Display -> Motion Smoothness. It\'s definitely worth the battery hit and for some reason not turned on by default. If you\'d like to save battery you can always turn down the resolution to HD+ in Display -> Screen Resolution. I personally can\'t notice the difference between it and the higher resolutions.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Pixel', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'I see why the internet loves this phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I did a lit of research for my needs. Some stuff I didnt get into.  Reviewers in 2024 still love this phone. I agree, it's awesome. Solid construction, all Gorilla glass and metal. Nice weight. Good feel. Bought this older model because of reviews comparing to phones in same price range (up to $220), materials, speed processor great for youtube & my apps (I don't game on phone), beautiful screen, good cameras, small and slim fits in pocket with slim leather wallet flip case. Great price. I don't get software updates anymore, which I actually like. It's packed with features and settings that will take a while to explore. OS 13 is rich, OneUI 5.1 great. Vers 14 & 6 are latest and minor release from what I can tell/what I care about. I use carrier virus protection for free & MalwareBytes, and avoid sketchy links. The split screen, stacked widgets and all apps view that most models probably have has completely changed my user experience. No more app icons & folders all over my screens. Modern feel. Only thing I dislike so far is suggestion for Temu app built into all apps view. Very hard to remove but have a bit gone and not given up. Seller was awesome. Fast, flexible.

About 3-4 months after I received it I had a few instances of being called and the phone calls went straight to voicemail even though I did not have my phone set to airplane mode.  Over the next couple months I had times that my text messages would not go through. I knew it was not the Network Verizon as my 2 boys have their phones on my plan and they were right next to me and their phones worked.  Then a big issue started happening in which the \'voice\' part of the phone only worked intermittently.  I use Bixby & Google Assistant, and even though they were set up properly, they only worked sometimes and not others.  Bixby would perhaps hear and pop up on the screen, but not respond to my voice for the request.  Other times it worked correctly.  Just yesterday and today alone I have had to reboot my phone 3 times when I could not use either of those or my talk to text as the microphone and speaker were not working.  I contacted the seller first - never heard from them.  I next contacted Amazon two days in a row and was told there is nothing they can do.  I just finished with my last chat being told this once again.  I told them that had I known I was paying $200 for a phone that would only work a few months - I never would have purchased it.  This is what was erroneously in their item description:  About this item  This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors.

It\'s downright cute.It\'s also an interesting device.  I assumed it would be running some really stripped down Android, but it\'s running an OS called Mocor which offers a pretty refined dumb phone interface.  Seriously, if you used a cell phone in 2004, it shouldn\'t take you long to get the hang of what you\'re doing with this thing.  Apparently this is the OS that was on the re-released Nokia 3310 3g back in 2017.  It seems to be pretty refined.  I didn\'t run into any bugs while using it.I couldn\'t tell you a lot about that re-released 3310, but don\'t expect old school Nokia-like durability out of this device.  Its outer shell is a soft plastic.  I dropped it onto concrete from maybe two and a half feet up and it left little boogered up places in two spots.  It didn\'t damage the phone\'s operation at all, fortunately.I was worried about battery life since the included (fully removable and replaceable) battery is only 1000mAh, but since it\'s not a touch-screen smartphone the battery actually lasts a long time.  I think I went about 10 days before I had to recharge it (95% of that standby).  It\'s got a USB-C charging port.  It also has pins on the bottom so you can use the included charging stand.  It also includes a short USB-C cable to plug into either the phone or the base and a 0.55A charging brick.The box also contains a SIM card and brochure for Speedtalk Mobile.  I had never heard of them before, but their pricing is pretty competitive.  A brief look around their website didn\'t reveal to me which carrier network they use, but I suspect it\'s T-Mobile since they have ""America\'s Largest 5G Network"" in a portion of their marketing material, which is a marketing term used by T-Mobile as well.  Since the phone is unlocked for other carriers, I saw no need to test the Speedtalk service.It has a decent manual included, though for a phone that seems to be wanting to market toward seniors, they could have made it bigger.  The print isn\'t as minuscule as what\'s in the instructions that come with a lot of overseas products you see nowadays, but any seniors will definitely need to get their readers out to get anywhere with it.I was able to make and receive calls on the T-Mobile network (through Mint Mobile).  I could also send and receive SMS and MMS messages.  It did take a little bit to get registered on their network completely.  It showed T-Mobile as the carrier for a while and wouldn\'t let me make or receive calls, but after 20-30 minutes I could.  You can still disable caller id for your outgoing calls with this device, something that\'s been missing from Android for quite some time now.It recognized and showed reception for Verizion (via Visible) but I was unable to make or receive calls, nor could I send or receive txts.  I left that SIM in the phone for over a day just to make sure.  Verizon I believe is now implementing a draconian cell white list like AT&T (eg only letting Apple or Samsung devices on their network other than the ones they sell themselves).You can pair bluetooth headsets to make calls and listen to media from the internal storage or sdcard.  There is no 3.5mm jack and I have no way of testing but I really doubt if a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter would work with this device.  There also is no camera.  To my knowledge there is no GPS chip onboard, which makes this pretty ideal as a burner phone.  Finally, though I mentioned it before, the screen is not a touch screen.  The only thing that sets it apart from classic dumb phones is its 4G VoLTE and Bluetooth support.It has a pretty nice FM radio app.  It auto searches for channels that have good reception the first time you run it and it doesn\'t require anything extra to be plugged in to it for it to work unlike most Androids.  The downside to the radio app is that it won\'t play over bluetooth, only the phone\'s internal speaker.  The internal speaker isn\'t bad.  It\'s easily on par with your typical mid-budget Android device.I didn\'t test the SOS function, but that could come in handy for the target audience.  In addition to seniors, this would make a pretty great first phone for kids or maybe even teens who struggle to use their smart phone responsibly.  A third target audience would be where I find myself sometimes--on the edge of wanting to get as far off the grid as possible.  This phone, or one like it, would be a good start toward that end.The flashlight function utilizes and LED bulb located on the top of the phone that is fairly bright.  Since it\'s main purpose is to be a flashlight and not a flash bulb for photography, it actually projects light like a flashlight so it works better than the led torches on most smartphones.It has an sdcard slot underneath the battery along with the two SIM slots.  I am unsure what the maximum capacity for the sdcard is, as I couldn\'t find it in the listing nor in the product manual.  When plugged into a computer it functions as a USB Mass Storage device rather than an MTP device as Android has since version 5 or thereabouts.The buttons are large and faintly backlit when awake.  They make a satisfying clicky noise when you press them.  Everything about the phone just feels good to me, like some genuine love was sprinkled in with the engineering.  I\'m not really familiar with what dumb phones are available on the market right now, but this has got to be one of the best.  A few times while using it I felt a lot of nostalgia for technologically simpler days.If you\'re looking for a smart phone but got here because of the price, be aware that there is at least one smart phone in this price range which can perform adequately with Android (you can peruse my reviews from this year to find it).  If you or the intended recipient of this phone needs a working phone in its simplest form, or desires to avoid being tracked and listened to on-demand by corporations or government agencies, then this phone deserves serious consideration.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Doodle lover', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Basic phone for calls', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This is a very basic ""dumb"" phone, by that I mean that it is primarily for phone calls no internet browsing or apps.

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I\'m happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they\'re not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I\'m committed to the new phone, don\'t want to lose it, but don\'t want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I\'ll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don\'t run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it\'s all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here\'s the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it\'s good, we\'ll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I\'m no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Eric Sullivan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Too easy…', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'On my journey of ordering a refurbished iPhone and it can be a journey this was an excellent purchase.  Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Joshua A.

Except I'm finding that the button that turns on my phone with my finger actually makes my phone turn on!!!This seems like such an obvious thing but I have several other phones where the fingerprint sensor is on the side and it won't turn on if I touch it with my finger so this is pretty awesome.I really prefer all my phones that have the fingerprint sensor on the back I have to admit this one does actually work ... I STILL PREFER THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR ON THE BACK.Also for this package it does come with a case but ORDER SCREEN PROTECTORS.I always do this for every phone strong screen protectors actually prevent my screen from breaking which makes the Blu phones so much more affordable.Also I really love this case which is clear so I can actually differentiate it from my other devices.Still it has weird bumps on all the side so I really don't like it for that reason I wish it was a smooth phone and had bumps only for where the buttons are.UPDATED TO ADD: In order to shut down or restart the phone you have to pull down in order to get to settings to find the power setting which over time has become really annoying.Overall I like the battery life and the storage size but this has been really irritating like a pebble in the shoe kind of irritating.It is typical to hold down the power button to restart devices but it doesn't work for this one.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jean-Jose JULIEN', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Such a goog phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very good products at an affordable price. just find that the speaker is too low.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'DKDiveDude', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Horrible GPS and Gyroscope!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Since day one I bought this phone, the GPS reception and gyroscope detection have been horrible.

I really like this phone coming from a conventional handset.  Some of my ideal phone criteria are:- Compact device- Mainstream/higher end performance- DurabilityHere is why this phone works for me.- Size:  My previous phone was S10e.  Yes it was old but I liked the compact size compared to many larger phones these days.  Even the standard S24 is bigger.  Although it is thicker, I like the fact that it fits in my pocket comfortably.- Performance:  It has the latest processor, 512GB of storage and 12 gig of memory.  The camera is now on par with other premium devices and now is truly considered a flagship device.  All good.- Durability:  Don\'t get me wrong...  The flip phone will probably never be as durable as a conventional handset, but the Z flip now has dust protection in addition to moisture protection.  Now that Samsung has gone through several life cycles, I feel comfortable using the fold devices.- Price:  People complain that the price went up by $100.  There are deals to be had and ways to bring down the price.Summary:My old S10e did pretty much everything that newer phones do in terms of the features. including wireless pay and reverse charging.  The only reason for me to look for a new phone was to address the failing (aging) battery.  As it was a good time for me to look for a new device, I wanted to considering something different and new.  The Z flip added the folding ""trick"", and it is a welcoming change.  One, I can mostly triage messages and etc on the cover screen and minimize the big screen.  Two, the main screen, because of its oddly long aspect ratio, works pretty well working with 2 separate windows.  It is very useful.

It actually appears to be in new condition. It came with the OEM charger and cable. That's a first for me and I've been purchasing my cell phones second hand for years.I downgraded from a Samsung Note 8. There is no Samsung Note 8 or above that you can get for under $100, so your only choice will be the Moto G Stylus 2022 (4G). The sensitivity of the stylus is worse on the Moto G Stylus, but you still can take notes. The note app itself is simple. The camera is decent and you can take better night photos with the night vision option in the camera app. The rear camera is 50mp, but there is no image stabilization. You get the same amount of RAM - 6GB and more storage - 128GB than on the base Note 8 (6GB ram, 64GB storage). The phone is fast enough for your tasks and handles basic games well too.So far so good. The phone has crashed once, but it could be a software conflict. I will try to come back and do an update in the future.If you are on a budget and need a replacement for your Samsung Galaxy Note series, this is a decent phone.Update: 3/6/24 - I've had this phone now for a while. No new crashes thankfully. I'm almost certain it was some kind of app conflict. The battery doesn't last two days as advertised, but not a problem for me. It will last for a day with heavy use (Watching videos for example). I didn't mention sound. It's good. I don't think it's like on the flagship phones, but there is Dolby Atmos if you plug in headphones. It actually has a jack. I'm not sure what else to add. The display is good. No, it's not like a high end oled phone, but that's not a big thing. I like the IPS LCD. It is more than adequate. The colors seem very realistic. I don't use saturated colors, but if that's your thing the option is avaliable. You can also select the color temperature. Overall, an excellent little (ok more like big) phone for under $100.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Teri', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Love It!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I am on my 3rd Moto g stylus phone.

I wanted a second phone  that is for my my better half. T-Mobile is the carrier. This unlocked phone works fine except for few issues. The phone has 2 modes to receive an incoming call which my wife finds hard to master; very annoying. When the phone is in locked mode she has to swipe up to receive a call; otherwise normally she has to press the green circle & the call comes through. In order to turn off the phone completely she has to press hard and maintain a steady pressure if not the phone will  turn on  again live with the "" Hallo Moto "" voice. Sometimes when she turns on the phone a pop up fills the screen wanting you to update . When that happens it has to be turned off manually to proceed further.

I wear a hip pouch and it fits perfectly.If I need to surf the web I can use this phone or my laptop.I do not  the built in stylus as I have several pen like stylus .Overall a very excellent Motorola cell phone. Motorola has been making beepers long before cell phones came into being-----my opinion.My cell phone is a twilight blue and and with a red case it is very attractive. I chose a 2022 model as newer cell phone has many features/bugs to work out . Hope this review helps someone to get a new cell phone from Amazon.Make sure it is compatible with your carrier services, unlocked and GSM compatible.Very easy to switch out the SIM card and micro storage chip.When programming your new phone have them plugged side by side and transfer of info becomes a breeze.With fatherly Love and Regards for the Holidays.

I\'ll say that at this price level you will be hard pressed to find a phone with so many features, especially one that is just two years old.  Oddly enough, the 4G version of this phone (simply called the A32) has lenses with a higher resolution that this one, but I think 48MP resolution is pretty good, and a definite improvement over my previous phone.  The fingerprint scanner built into the side button is a nice way of unlocking your phone.  I requested a phone that was in ""excellent"" condition, and that was what I got, with absolutely no visible marks or damage to either the case or the screen.

I might attempt some hobbyist electronic repairs on it down the line, but for now I decided to shell out the money for a rugged military-grade phone with wireless charging capacity as a replacement.

È davvero l'ideale per chi lavora in ambienti duri o per chi ama avventure all’aperto, dove un normale smartphone non reggerebbe a lungo.Lo schermo da 6 pollici è pratico per l’uso quotidiano. Non sarà il massimo per chi cerca un’esperienza multimediale eccezionale, ma fa il suo dovere. La luminosità è sufficiente anche in condizioni di luce intensa, come quando sei all'aperto sotto il sole. Inoltre, lo schermo è protetto da un vetro resistente ai graffi, il che significa che puoi portarlo con te ovunque senza troppe preoccupazioni.Sul fronte delle prestazioni, non delude affatto. Con ben 24GB di RAM e 256GB di memoria interna, espandibile fino a 1TB, è più che adatto per chi usa tante app o salva molti file e foto. Non ho riscontrato rallentamenti, anche con diverse app aperte in contemporanea. Insomma, il telefono è fluido e veloce, e questo è un grande vantaggio per chi cerca affidabilità nel lungo periodo.Il sistema operativo è Android 14, quindi hai l’ultima versione del software, che è ben ottimizzata e facile da usare. Mi ha colpito il fatto che non ci siano app inutili preinstallate, cosa che spesso si trova in altri dispositivi. Tutto scorre liscio e senza intoppi, e non ho mai avuto la sensazione che fosse lento o pesante.La fotocamera, d'altra parte, non è il punto di forza di questo smartphone, ma fa il suo lavoro. Le foto sono decenti con buona luce, anche se di notte i risultati non sono eccellenti. Tuttavia, per un telefono rugged, che è pensato per la resistenza più che per la qualità fotografica, va più che bene. Anche i selfie e le videochiamate risultano di qualità accettabile, niente di spettacolare, ma adeguato per l'uso quotidiano.Uno degli aspetti migliori di questo telefono è sicuramente la batteria. Con una capacità di oltre 6000 mAh, dura facilmente tutta la giornata, anche se usato intensamente. Se lo utilizzi meno, potrebbe arrivare anche a due giorni di autonomia senza bisogno di ricarica, il che è fantastico per chi è spesso lontano da una presa di corrente. Non dover stare sempre attaccato a un caricatore è un gran sollievo, soprattutto per chi lavora in movimento o fa attività all’aperto.In termini di connettività, l'OUKITEL G1 supporta il 5G, il che significa che hai accesso a internet veloce ovunque ci sia copertura. È dotato anche di NFC, quindi puoi fare pagamenti contactless senza problemi. Lo sblocco con impronta digitale è rapido e preciso, così come lo sblocco facciale, che funziona bene e rende l’utilizzo ancora più comodo.Punti di forza:Resistente a cadute, acqua e polvere.Tantissima memoria e RAM.Batteria duratura, ottima per chi sta spesso fuori.Software aggiornato e semplice da usare\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gerok', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Ich habe nun das Oukitel G1 einen Monat in Betrieb und kann nur Positives berichten, zuerst der Akku den habe ich bei erhalt aufgeladen und erst nach 1 Monat wieder laden müssen und das ist einfach Genial ( Smartphone im normalen gebrauch , Telefonie, Internet, Kamera Test, usw. ), hervorzuheben ist : Bildqualität bei Foto und Video, Die Audioqualität bei Telefonie und Musik, der Touchscreen ist sehr exakt und reagiert sehr schnell und das bei Super Auflösung ( auch bei Sonnenlicht sehr gut lesbar), weiters hat das Smartphone ein sehr gute haptik, auch ist es einfach ein Speicherriese bereits von Werk aus (genügend Platz für Fotos usw ), alles in allem bin ich sehr Zufrieden und Glücklich damit das ich mich zum kauf für das OUKITEL G1 entschieden habe, ich kann es nur weiter Empfehlen !\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gorka', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on October 7, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nEl resultado de este Móvil rugerizado es bastante bueno , tiene una batería de muy larga duración , sobrado de RAM y rom y con reconocimiento facial , está preparado para mover cualquier aplicación por pesada que sea ya que tiene muy buenas prestaciones , va muy fluido y suena genial , este tipo de movil soporta muy bien los golpes y el agua , la pantalla se ve genial y es de muy buen tamaño de imagen para ver cualquier plataforma de streaming sin problema , me gusta mucho el chasis y los botones , que vienen muy bien protegidos .la memoria de 256gb no es fisica , sería de 12 GB así que hay que activar una opción para disfrutar de los 256gb de espacio virtual  , lleva android 14 que funciona realmente bien en este modelo , en definitiva el punto fuerte de este tipo de móviles es su batería que es eterna y el buen resultado que da para golpes y salpicaduras , eso sí  para hacerlo tan robusto le penalizaun poco  el peso aunque en pocos días te acostumbras .\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Oli', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on August 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es ist schon krass wie wenig Geld man ausgeben muss um ein Top Handy zu erhalten, dass sich hinter den iPhones nicht verstecken muss.

In the past he would get the cheap $30 phones and complain about them constantly so I thought I would get him this nice Nokia phone and it would be better.  WRONG!! The functionality of the phone is good. Nice size, feels strong and well made. It is easy to use but the battery doesn’t even last 24 hours whether he has talked on it or not. He only uses his phone for talk and he has done very little of that. No text or browsing so he is not running the battery down. If he doesn’t plug it up every night it will be dead in the morning. I’m very disappointed in the phone. In the description it said the battery has 18 hour standby time on a single charge but that is not true. Not a good value for the money.

It’s annoying to revert back to T-9 typing after using smart phones, but it’s not hard to figure out nor impossible.  In fact there’s a great review of this very phone on YouTube showing you how to use it. There’s Literally no reason to buy a “dumb phone” and then complain about how dumb it is.  It’s not hard. Anyway I got this phone for my daughter. I don’t want her having a smart phone. I know about the kids phone plans offered by companies like Gabb wireless, but they are so expensive and a smart phone still has an appeal even if it’s got parental locks. This rugged basic phone here is affordable, and it doesn’t have internet browsing or an App Store. It just texts and calls. I didn’t even want to buy her a phone, but now that middle schoolers get extra curricular activities just as much as high schoolers I relented. I love how study this phone is. Dropping it doesn’t kill it like it would kill an iPhone or Samsung. The true annoying thing about it is that when it turns off and back on you’re locked out. You have to get the SIM card out, write down the PUK numbers on it, and then type in the PUK code to open it up. The screen size is small. Receiving texts is a tad annoying because the resolution is low and large bodies of text may not appear on the same page. Photos are grainy, and It functions in the realm of bare minimum. No touch screen. No bells and whistles. It truly is a phone that has no appeal to a kid/tween which is perfect. She texts her friends a little, but it mostly gets sat down or put away and that makes it a perfect starter phone. T9 makes too much texting annoying, too. So she’s discouraged from spending a lot of time on it. The only thing I hate is that I can’t control spam calls. So I had to teach her about not answering unknown numbers.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kevin Beckwith', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""USA MetroPCS Compatable in 2024.

Awesome.  If you are looking for a phone straight out of 2005 that you can use on today\'s networks, this one is it.  It doesn\'t lag.  It not some Kai-os sudo-android interface running on slow hardware causing lagging and crashing.  It\'s a true dumb phone.  The software feels like a true dumb phone.  But it also has a few tricks up it\'s sleeve:- Bluetooth- Dual Sims- Calculator- Flashlight- Micro-SD card slot- Something like 32mb of onboard storage- Plays Mp3\'s.  They can play in the background, so you can have music going while texting someone.  Yes, this WORKS WITH BLUETOOTH headphones or your car, and yes, it actually sounds good.  Play them off the tiny internal memory or a Micro-SD card.  You can also plug the USB cable it comes with from the phone to your computer and access both the Micro-SD card slot and the phone\'s internal memory as separate drives.  So you don\'t need a Micro-SD card reader on your computer.- FM Radio (doesn\'t work with bluetooth headphones for some reason, but you can play it through the speakerphone)- Upload your own ringtones and notification sounds.  You can store them on the Micro-SD card or the internal memory.- Camera.  It\'s garbage.  Even by early 2000\'s standards its garbage.  But it does exist, you can send and receive pictures, store them internally, upload them to your computer through USB, etc.  I don\'t plan on using it, but if my wife wants to send me a picture of something, at least i can see it.  You kind of need a camera phone to do that with.  Non-camera dumb phones typically don\'t receive pictures of have screens capable of rendering pictures.  This one will do it.It is a little big and cheap feeling, but I don\'t think dropping it will break it.  It has kind of that ""jitterbug"" old people phone aesthetic more in real life than in the pictures.  But as a millennial who\'s first cellphone was a Kyocera K7 Rave running on Virgin Mobile for 25 cents per minute, this phone has my approval as an official dumb-phone if you\'re trying to take your life back from phone addiction.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'L.

You can call, text, and listen to music via the FM radio or by loading an SD card with MP3s. And there’s even a 3.5 jack to play wired headphones. Playing the radio or MP3s ate up the battery quickly, so I didn’t use it, but I tested it for the team. :-).One feature I constantly use is the cool flashlight. This is a dedicated flashlight, not just a backlight screen masquerading as a flashlight. It is a bright LED, and being on the top of the phone, it points very naturally.At 115g, the phone fits in any pocket.The AGM has two SIM slots, which are ideal for travelling. The battery is removable and easily swapped. Spare batteries cost less than $20, and replacing the battery takes less than five minutes. The phone is loud, the LED screen bright, and the buttons large with a tactile click.I live in an area with poor cell reception, and the AGM works well making and receiving calls. Texting is possible with the numerical keypad.There’s a calendar, calculator, and camera—all basic but all working.A fast charger and a USB C cable are included in the box, and the manual is easy for even a boomer like me to understand! :-)A basic phone has much to recommend it. They are very affordable and less prone to damage than a smartphone. The AGM can go three days between charges, and an old battery doesn’t require expensive service work to be fixed. A basic phone also carries less personal and financial data than most smartphones.With an IP68 rating, it is waterproof and dustproof, so makes a perfect work phone.In conclusion, the AGM M9 is a rugged phone with easy-to-use features.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'VKe-KI', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on October 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Die Äußere Gestaltung ist gut.

My last phone was a BLU F91 5G, which if it was still available I would have just bought another.  I can\'t reconcile mentally why there is no wireless charging.  Seriously, all the reasonably priced options don\'t have it any longer.  The only reason I ""upgraded"" was because the battery in my old phone got hot enough to off gas and blow the back of the case off on my old phone so I did not have a ton of time to wait around looking for a new phone.I have been using this phone for a week and here are all the things I have noticed so far.1. It does have a dual sim card slot, but an odd one.  Its on the bottom of the phone, and very difficult to get out even with the tool they provided, it took a bit of a hook to get it out.  Its thicker than usual and the sim card kind of snaps in, because its double sided.  You put one card facing out on the top and bottom, new to me after having dozens of phones.  Nowhere could I find if it was dual sim in the documentation (Sim1 is on top).2. Its big enough storage to justify not having an SD card slot.  I know nobody is doing it these days, but I have had more phones die than SD cards and a good waterproof SD card can save the day if you have a whole trips worth of pictures on the phone when you dunk it hard enough to kill the phone.  But, with 256GB its got enough storage for all my MP3\'s and lots of pictures (I travel a lot and am on the water often where I have no service but want to be able to have music on board) plus all my apps.  There was a bunch of unnecessary bloatware but not terrible and it was easy to clean up.  I am at 41% used before I start taking pictures so its a bit dicey for long term usage.3. The onboard storage is slow.  Unbearably slow.  Transferring my files from my Windows or Unix PC was maddeningly slow, regardless of USB cable or which port I used.  These are the same devices and cables I use for my old phone as well as an even older BLU G91 Pro and they are both 100 times faster to copy files over USB either to the SD card or the internal storage.  It was so slow and unusable that I had to try multiple cables and ports before giving up on moving my MP3\'s over by USB and installing an FTP client on my phone.  That was the only way I could move anything more than a few small files on or off the phone.  Its something that I can overcome but its maddening.4. It came with a screen protector on it.  Its good because there are not a lot of options yet, but I didn\'t see that anywhere.5. The case it comes with is laughable and there are not many options currently and you never know if there ever will be.  Honestly for this to be in the Bold line and not have a better case than this is a bit odd.  My last 2 phones had the black lightly armored cases that were good enough not to need an upgrade, this one is going back a few years and its a throw away if you can find something better.  The first one I have tried doesn\'t even come close to having the right openings for this phone even if it fits the general form factor and camera lens so if you need a decent case maybe this is not the right phone for you.6. The fingerprint scanner is adequate but not great.  Its in the screen which is the new hottness, but it doesn\'t work as well as my last several low end phones.  I have 7 or 8 fingerprints registered to try and help my two fingers work but I have to hold it just right to get it to unlock.  It works and I am getting used to it but the back panel and power button scanners both work better for me.7. Battery life is fantastic and it charges well.  It does take a bit more power to do a fast charge but it is very fast and the battery easily lasts me all day.  No complaints at all, other than damn I wish it had wireless charging, I mean its 2024 and many, many cars have wireless charging and it would be great to be able to use it. I know it adds heat and I wouldn\'t really use it in the summer and its not that fast but if you are driving its nice to just keep it topped off if you don\'t want to deal with wires.8. The screen is just lovely.  I really should have lead with this.  its the nicest looking screen I have every used, and its very bright and very clear.  It is so easy to read I might be in the market for a second one because my wife\'s phone screen is terrible compared to this one.9. Its fast enough most of the time.  Fastest phone I have ever had, very responsive nearly all the time.  The ram is plenty for an old dude who has way to much open and way to many notifications all the time. The only thing slow so far is the camera, and I wonder if its because the storage is slow.  That sucks for me, I have missed several candid shots already and experience has told me this is as fast as the phone will get. I am going to have to slow down myself and see if lowering the resolution will help but as of now the shutter speed is slow enough I have taken several pictures of my feet.  I have only taken few a dozen pictures and a couple videos, and while they look really really good on the screen I haven\'t tried them on a big screen yet.  The camera would also benefit from some form of stabilization but it works well enough for the price point from a quality standpoint.Overall its a good phone, I wish it had a decent case, and faster camera and storage.  It wouldn\'t hurt to have an SD card slot.  It still sucks to not have wireless charging.  I hope BLU brings that one back.  Its a great phone to look at and feels good in my hand and for the price its very good.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'tien phan', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very nice phone but two problems', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is a very nice phone in quality, screen Super AMOLED.

Since then I have had waves of negative experiences with the software on the phone, and today capped it off with something that defies logic.When first setting the phone up, I was informed my PIN was too weak, and now needed to be 8 digits long. Alright, a bit weird but I can handle it. Then it maxed out at 3 fingerprints instead of my previous phone's 5, which has caused me minor grief because I've found that the fingers I chose to forego, index and thumb on my left hand, I actually used a fair bit more than I realized.Next up was the One+ UI, a disaster of an interface that took me hours to figure out how to bypass in favor of my typical layout. This comes packaged with an obscene amount of bloatware, and there's a hardware-based warranty void if you attempt to root to remove any of those apps, which I will never use and only take up space on the device. Fine, whatever, I'll adapt.Then it decided it wasn't going to connect to my PC with a transfer protocol, choosing only to charge itself from the connection. This was the first major issue with the phone, as I frequently moved files between my PC and previous phone and now am unable to do so directly, making file management a pain. There was one option I had left to work around this, a thumb drive with USB-A on one side and USB-C on the other, so I could connect it to my PC, drop desired files onto it, then connect it to the phone and offload them. A pain, but a workaround for the time being.And then it decided it didn't want to do mobile data after disconnecting from a Wi-Fi signal, requiring a full reboot to register that, yes, I do in fact pay a significant amount extra on my mobile plan for unlimited data and it should be using that. This would reproduce every time I disconnected from a Wi-Fi signal, until finally I opened the developer options and forced it to keep mobile data on even when on Wi-Fi.And then today I noticed the thing that finally bothered me enough to say something. I was transferring an album to the phone and happened to check the notifications pane, and it said it was charging the connected USB device. Let me repeat that: it was CHARGING A FLASH DRIVE. The drive was concerningly warm, and there was no way to disable it as the USB settings were apparently controlled by said flash drive. I checked online for any sort of solution or workaround, and found that this has apparently been the case since at least 2017 and Samsung has done nothing about it. This absurd misunderstanding of basic hardware is so far beyond what any QA should have caught, and if it's been part and parcel of Samsung devices for SEVEN YEARS then I'm done with Samsung's ecosystem. Y'all can keep your bloatware and atrocious programming; see how many customers it wins you.Editing this review on account of new developments; I now have grounds to take off the last pity star I was willing to give. The phone has started refusing to recognize its mobile data as an option every time it connects to Wi-Fi. I went so far as to order a new SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the symptoms have started to recognize on the new card as well. Given that I use this phone for work on the go, this is absolutely unacceptable. One star, fix your useless OS.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'mike dewitt', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Came on time\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Bulky and slow, but very cheap!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023', 'Review Body': ""This is a decent budget phone, but I really wish I spent a bit more and got something thinner (check the measurements!!!), smaller, and with more performance.

I took it to Europe and back, dropped it a gazillion times, the back battery is exposed in one corner, and yet it still works today.My second and third phone where Moto G Power 2020 and 2021. They are just too heavy. I drop one face first, cracked the screen too hard that I can\'t safely touch it. The other one is still working today but stutters like crazy.My forth phone is Moto G Pure. This phone is pure garbage. Once I synced up all my apps it runs slower than a PS2. Absolute trash of a phone that should have not been release.That brings me up to this phone, the G14. I\'ve owned it for 2 days, transferred all my apps, so far so good.The key points that make this a good purchase,1. It is $130 bucks. If you buy an iPhone or flagship android, you are easily spending 10 times this amount. Now with your $1000 phone, you got to add a case to protect it, maybe you add a screen protector too. Now your phone is 2 milimeters thicker, which probably makes it bigger than this phone.2. It looks like a shanzhaied iPhone 11. Shan Zhai means mountain fortress which just sounds very cool. If people ask you what phone it is, you can say it is motorola and they will go oh, I haven\'t heard that names in years.3. It\'s got 2 Sim slots and a SD card slot.

Yes it was old but I liked the compact size compared to many larger phones these days.  Even the standard S24 is bigger.

The camera is now on par with other premium devices and now is truly considered a flagship device.  All good.- Durability:  Don\'t get me wrong...  The flip phone will probably never be as durable as a conventional handset, but the Z flip now has dust protection in addition to moisture protection.  Now that Samsung has gone through several life cycles, I feel comfortable using the fold devices.- Price:  People complain that the price went up by $100.  There are deals to be had and ways to bring down the price.Summary:My old S10e did pretty much everything that newer phones do in terms of the features. including wireless pay and reverse charging.  The only reason for me to look for a new phone was to address the failing (aging) battery.  As it was a good time for me to look for a new device, I wanted to considering something different and new.  The Z flip added the folding ""trick"", and it is a welcoming change.  One, I can mostly triage messages and etc on the cover screen and minimize the big screen.

Here's the review with a bullet-point summary of each critique added at the end:---The Blu Bold K10 phone has proven to be a solid choice for my needs, earning a commendable 4-star rating from me.This phone offers 4G connectivity, ensuring reliable and fast internet access. One of the standout features is its beautiful display, which provides vibrant and sharp visuals. The inclusion of a screen protector and case cover is a thoughtful addition, offering immediate protection right out of the box. Priced at just $99.00, the Bold K10 delivers impressive value for money.The phone boasts a generous 128GB of storage, with the option to expand it by an additional 128GB using the dual SIM and memory tray. This flexibility is particularly useful for managing both personal and professional communications.However, the phone does have a few drawbacks. The absence of NFC means no Google Wallet support for tap purchases, and the phone can sometimes take a long time to boot up. Additionally, it only offers 16 setting features compared to the 26 on my old phone, and the resolution and screen alignment can be off-center when switching between portrait and landscape modes. The volume isn't as high as desired, and hacks to increase it are suppressed.Despite these minor issues, the Blu Bold K10 meets my current needs effectively. I'm comfortable using this phone until I decide to upgrade to a more fully featured model. Overall, the Bold K10 is a reliable and cost-effective option that I would recommend to those looking for a budget-friendly smartphone with ample storage and a beautiful display.Critique Summary:- Sometimes takes a long time to boot up.- No NFC feature, so no Google Wallet/tap purchases.- Only 16 setting features compared to 26 on my old phone. The Motorola 5G Stylus is a lackluster phone  and in many ways the Blu Bold K10vhas several superior features.- Resolution and screen alignment issues in portrait vs. landscape mode.- Volume is not great and cannot be increased due to suppression of hacks.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Geoff Tate', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Won't connect to 4g network"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It won't connect to 4 g network and the battery life is rubbish\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Raildig', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very Poor Battery Life, Glitches, Nasty Sound', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I recently bought a pair of the BLU View 5 phones for use as Wi-Fi devices around the house instead of cheap tablets, and have been very surprised at how good they are for the price.

There were none and I felt I was on my own!  They really should have instructions, even a half page of information.  Finally, figured out that I needed to remove the SIM CARD from my OLD phone and insert it into this NEW phone!  I didn't know that at first.  Once I finally set it up, I was off and running.  I really like this phone.  Nice features for my purposes.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'jscar', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Motorola 2023 GoPlay Smartphone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Nice big screen, which unfortunately broke in two spots after I had only used it a few days, while I was waiting for a case, also ordered through Amazon.

I think they succeeded for the most part with the S24 FE.The display and camera are the two key factors in phone quality, in my opinion.  The display here is an FHD+ (basically 1080p) 6.7"" AMOLED, which is the same size as the S24+ with a lower resolution.  The AMOLED gives great response timea and black levels and the lower resolution is not very important to overall image quality.  I am impressed for the price.Photo quality is excellent and similar to the S24+, with particularly impressive 4K60 video quality.  It can also record 8K30 if you want to have some room for cropping.  I normally go with Google phones, and it is a close competition.  I think the Pixels do a better job in low light and have more vivid colors with default settings.  The AI tools are fun to play with, but feel very early.  I don\'t see a generative function that allows you to type in things to fill selected areas with, but I may be missing it.The chipset is notably slower than the S24+, which is not very relevant in my usage so far.  This is still a capable 2024 exynos and able to handle demanding apps and multitasking.  It may not last as many years without becoming outdated.This is my first Samsung and I was happy to see it was not stuffed with intrusive Samsung apps I may not prefer over other apps.  The Samsung AI for things like translation is cool and the phone also comes with Google AI for things like circle to search.  With that, you can point your camera at anything in the phone app, hold the home button down, then circle something to search for it.  It works remarkably well and better than any AI tool I have used before.  Everyone I\'ve shown it to was blown away.Without a case, the phone feels like an oiled up brick that tries to slip from my hands.  With a case, that is solved and, while a little clunky, is not bad to hold for long periods.Overall, this is an excellent phone that achieves the goal of giving a flagship experience.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Danny R.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Stellar phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've been obsessed with it since it arrived.

Try Now Before They Cost $$ to Use.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is a great phone at a price point that doesn't have too many choices.  I also learned that Samsung may start charging for the Galaxy AI features in 2026, and I wanted to try them out before they cost $$ to use.  I also picked this Galaxy Fan Edition phone because I need a phone with a big enough screen to watch videos / basic gaming, but not too huge.  My other primary concern is battery life.  I need a phone that can get me through a normal day without charging.  I like to end up no lower than 20%, and almost every day, I ended up about 20% or more.  This phone is big and it has a big battery too.I was also impressed with how quickly this phone charged vs my last Samsung phone  I was able to get this sucker charged to ~55% in 30 minutes with a fast 25w wired charger!  But because it has a big battery, and all batteries slow down charging after they're about 70% full, it took me about another 2.5 hours to get it fully charged.I was really excited to try out from of the new AI capabilities, and although I don't really NEED a new phone, I wanted to try out Samsungs AI features while they are free.  I heard that Samsung may start charging for them in 2025 or 2026.  That's the logic I used to get this phone lol.  I travel a lot and use chat for work with people who are not native english speakers, so I tried some of the chat translation features, and that worked pretty well.  It's certainly better than typing what you want into translate and then copying it into chat.I was really looking forward to the live translate feature, as sometimes I attend meetings and vid calls in multiple languages.  The live translate feature really did not work that great.  I don't know if this is because I was using it professionally and there are some biz terms that it couldn't get, but it wasn't that useful.Oddly, the feature that I did like the best and one that I use a lot is the circle to search, where I can circle anything on my phone screen and then google searches for it.  That was pretty useful as I like easily identifying stuff along my hikes, but I already basically do that anyway with google lens.I know there are a lot of graphics AI features, and I'm sure I'll get around to using those productively, but for me they don't have much of a purpose other than trying to figure out why AI thinks I'm such a bad artist.But the bottom line is, AI is going to be around for a looooong time and we are just at the beginning.  I remember when the first iphone came out and it was such a pain to type on the thing.  Early tech stuff always takes time, and both the users and the tech get better over time.I like using new tech early, so I can keep up, and I definitely want to try it out while it doesn't cost anything extra other than the cost of a really good phone.\nRead more""}]",,,Galaxy S24 FE,Graphite,,USB Type C,Single SIM,Smartphone,4000 Milliamp Hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

It would connect for a little bit, the won\'t receive signal. It will keep you connected to wifi, but will act as if you have no internet. I keep my wifi off for best data performance, which is great for me. For those looking to stay connected to wifi, this may be a deal breaker. I\'ve looked on Reddit and this seems to be an issue with the 8 series. Hopefully it gets patched, but considering it\'s been over 6 months, it\'s unlikely.I left Android for iPhone about 5 years ago, and I always missed the freedom Android gave me. The ""major"" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that\'s a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (""chugged"" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).I won\'t explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won\'t let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn\'t notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to ""pass the aux cord"" XD.The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it\'s primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can\'t compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you\'ll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you\'ll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn\'t matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn\'t use it, anyway.Tl;dr:If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'GBustin', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything about it is amazing.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024', 'Review Body': '2nd UPDATE on 8/7/2024:Somebody asked if the Redmagic 9S Pro was compatible for Bend Oregon? To begin with, I have a 8S pro, the model before. I have not heard of ANY incompatibility issues. I have T-mobile and it works perfectly. It has a double sim tray and I could have 2 phone numbers on it if I wanted. I still don\'t game, but I use it extensively to watch videos and run my Powerpoint presentations (in Google Slides). Everything runs perfectly, and extremely fast, never a gliche. I know my phone is over-powered for what I do, but it\'s like owning a Lamborghini to run everyday errands. And the battery is the best thing. I still charge my phone every 3 days, and I use it a lot. I also use my standard 3.5mm phone jack a lot too and would have gotten it for that one thing. The antenna is great, never a gliche using google maps. It is just an awesome phone. I worried that it\'s 6.8"" size might be too big, but with a slim case, the thin phone fits easily in the front pockets of my jeans. I assume the 9S pro is the same or better.UPDATE ON 3/24/2024:This phone is amazing for what I need. Most amazing is the 6 amp hour battery that never seems to run out. I used to charge my old phone every day, sometimes twice a day. I charge the new redmagic phone every 3 days (still at 20%), and it only takes 18 minutes to fully charge! That one thing alone makes it worth the  money. It is extremely fast for video & powerpoint files, and the usb3.2 jack allows me to connect to my PC and easily and quickly move big files back and forth. You don\'t need to play games to make good use of an extremely powerful phone.INITIAL REVIEW:First I\'m not a gamer, but I need a powerful phone with big screen, USB3.0 or better data transfer and most of all, a 3.5mm headphone jack! This has it all. It has an awesome big screen with graphics subprocessor system that makes it extremely fast, which wasn\'t absolutely necessary, but it plays my powerpoint files breathtakingly fast. The USB 3.2 connector connects easily to my PC because it is important for me to transfer large data files to and from the phone. It works great. It has 12GB ram and 256GB rom, the minimum for this phone. That is more than I need but you can upgrade to much more memory and storage. I use the 3.5mm headphone jack nearly every day to play music and videos, and absolutely would not have a phone without one. The BATTERY is a monster. It has two 3,000 mah batters totaling 6,000 mah. What that means is the way I use it, I only have to charge it every 3 days! And after I run it down below 20%, it recharges all the way to full in about 15 minutes. Amazing. I had heard that the camera wasn\'t the best, but it is plenty good for me. It has Sony lenses and takes great photos and videos, in high resolution if you want, and even has a pro mode for mini picture adjustments that I will never do. And it costs literally half what a flagship samsung or iphone cost, half. I cannot comment on games which this phone was designed for, because I don\'t play games. The simple cheap case I bought for it looks sleek and great. The only possible negative is that it\'s heavy, because of the huge battery that lasts forever. SUMMARIZING: this is one awesome phone that any older non-gamer will be thrilled to own.

La batería dura un buen rato (un día entero) si no juegas y si es necesario con el cargador incluido lo llenarás en muy, pero muy poco tiempo. LAs cámaras traseras son suficientemente buenasContras: Tardado de tranferir lo de tu anterior teléfono; no tiene aplicaciones propias (todo está basado en google), no tiene ningún instructivo (ni impreso ni PDF, ni nada de nada), la cámara frontal si muestra ""halos"" como si estuviese sucia, cuando tomas selfies de cerca no se notan.En resumen, si eres fan de las selfies n espacios abiertos este telefono te va a causar pesadillas, Pero si juegas, trabajas y editas cualquier otra cosa... es el teléfono de tus sueños hecho realidad.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Maria de Lourdes Hernandez Morales', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on August 6, 2023', 'Review Body': 'A mi esposo le gustó mucho, lleva varios días usándolo y le ha funcionado muy bien.\nRead more'}]",,120 Hz,9S Pro Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!- materials make it feel premium! Samsung put a lot of effort into perfecting the foldable feeeling of quality. I also own an S24 ultra and they feel almost identical in terms of trust I have in the physical design and materials. Extremely well machined!- using the outside screen doesn't feel terrible and cramped as I had expected. It's a lot like when I got my flip and thought it was weirdly tall, but I got used to it.- ecosystem integration is finally to a point I can recommend people get everything Samsung, like the watch, ring, and tablets! Copy and paste works, if I need to open a message on my phone from my watch, I can immediately just open my phone, copy an OTP, etc.Ehhh:- Battery life is middling, it will last you all day, BUT with low-medium use. I am in a job where I use it around 4 hours a day and it struggles to be at even 20% at the end of my day.- Samsung bloatware is Mostly removable, I miss my pixel phones with completely uninstallable to no bloatware. I hate that we have non-uninstallabke bloatware like AR camera or Bixby (Google assistant FTW)Cons:- app support is getting closer to being more widespread but still not where it needs to be, some apps have issues with both the external and internal display ratios, whether it be too skinny to display things, or too wide to display things properly.- front/internal camera is terrible, it is taking a picture through the screen, but it is simply unacceptably bad- Brightness of the screen is not enough for outdoor use. I went to a local restaurant today and noticed I could barely see the screen with extra brightness enabled in overcast weather.Overall 8.5/10TL:DRPhysical design is impeccable, however software support and battery life hold it back from being what Samsung envisions: the perfect compact phone. 8.5/10\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Paul R Crow', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great product', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The 6th gen of the Z-Fold is a winner.

The durability is no joke - dropped it a few times on my hiking trip and not even a scratch. That massive 10300mAh battery is a lifesaver, lasted through a whole weekend camping trip with juice to spare. The 6.7-inch screen is pretty nice, makes watching videos or reading maps a breeze. Android 14 runs smooth, no lag even with multiple apps open. Now for the slightly less rugged bits - while it's tough, it's also bulky. Definitely not slipping this into skinny jeans pockets. The camera is okay but nothing spectacular, especially in low light. 64GB storage fills up fast if you're taking lots of photos or videos. The reverse charging is handy but drains the battery pretty quick. If you're an outdoor enthusiast or work in tough conditions, this phone could be your new best friend. It's definitely given me peace of mind on adventures, even if it's not winning any beauty contests. Great for construction workers, hikers, or anyone hard on their phones.

If it’s just sitting, it will last over a week.4) Big screen if you like that.5) Android 14.0.6) Photo quality is good.  Not the best.  No panoramic or extra features.7) Antenna quality is adequate.8) Nice loud speaker.  Probably the best I’ve ever heard.Cons:1) A very heavy phone.  You are going to notice it.  It’s about 3x as heavy as my iPhone.2) Even though it is tough, the cameras protrude on the back, so they can be wrecked if dropped.3) It’s big.  You could almost consider it a mini tablet.4) It’s not very fast.  There is some noticeable lag, especially for a few minutes after restarting it.5) The advertised 12GB memory is not completely true.  It is 4GB and you can boost it to 12B by using storage space.6) The fingerprint scanner is fussy.7) The front camera is not good for face recognition because it seem to be pointed upward a few degrees.  So you will be looking at it and it’s only getting the top of your head.  It is slow detection too.8) No SD slot for extra storage!  It would really add value, but alas, there is not slot.If you need a low cost phone, that is fairly tough, has a large screen, and dual SIM, this is it.

Darunter z. B. den „Nörgler“, wenn nur eine Funktion oder Kleinigkeit abweicht oder nicht seinen persönlichen Vorstellungen entspricht, ist das ganze Produkt „Schrott“. Dann gibt es natürlich auch noch den „Lobpreisenden“, alles ist toll, das Produkt kann quasi alles. Seine Euphorie steht über allem und es gibt stets volle Punktzahl.Welcher „Rezensionist“ bin ich? Bewertungen beruhen nun mal auf den eigenen Erfahrungen mit dem Produkt. Ich bemühe mich deshalb bei meinen Rezensionen, möglichst objektiv zu sein und so eine brauchbare und ehrliche Grundlage zur Kaufentscheidung zu bieten.

The user interface tries to do too many things: take pictures, videos, do text messages, check voice mail, check missed calls . . . Seniors need a phone that does one thing GREAT (make phone calls) and move everything else to the back burner, still available, but buried away in the menus for savy Seniors who feel like exploring bonus features.  There are so many things they could have done to make phone calling easier.  This is actually better than other flip phones, but not as much as hoped for.  I\'d suggest they make the call menu top priority for the phone, scroll down and have the contact names right there, then press okay and it immediately calls that contact.  To do anything else should require navigating through the MENU which could be at the top, right above all the contact names.  Easy, problem solved, and many more aging seniors would be able to use it.----EDIT---- My mother is constantly accidentally turning the volume down (pressing the buttons on the side) and then saying things like  ""I can\'t hear you I can\'t hear you I can\'t hear you"" and has difficulty figuring out she needs to turn the volume back up.  subtracting another star.  surprisingly difficult for her to use this phone---REEDIT -- this is an AWFUL PHONE, Mom and I can\'t figure out how to adjust the ringer volumn up, I tried to talk to her on another phone telling her which button to press, the volumn button on the side that the manual clearly specifies, didn\'t work, she actually got it to drop down to silent.  0 stars now, if can\'t figure it out will have to cancel---Re-REedit 3rd time --  Mom still can\'t figure out how to adjust the ringer volume.  It arbitrarily gets set to Ringer-OFF (I suspect from hitting the side buttons by accident) then the phone does\'t ring and she doesn\'t answer it, and when she tries to adjust the volumn while I\'m on the phone with her, when I tell her how, she adjusts the Conversation-Volume.  The folks at Jitterbug need to get a phone design that\'s not prone to senior citizens accidently pressing the ringer volume to OFF.  It\'s more than a head-ache, it causes her to NOT HEAR THE PHONE RING.  sure, young folks can figure out what\'s going on, and try not to do it again, but elderly seniors don\'t learn from past mistakes and cant figure things out easily.

He knows how to do that, and it is reliable that way!Hidden in the accessibility settings in the phone is a handy one to lock the exterior buttons so he can’t accidentally turn the ringer volume down.We also liked that this has Alexa capability so he might be able to use dial by voice on top of the flip phone practicality.Unfortunately Amazon and Lively aren’t friendly enough to have a seamless integration of Alexa with the phone. It’s hard to set up and the results leave something to be desired.First you have to link your Lively and Amazon accounts which is understandable, but then you have to add the Lively ‘skill’ to Alexa on this device.The big disappointment is that even after jumping through the hoops to successfully set it up you can’t say, “Alexa, call Tommy.”  You have to say, “Alexa, ask Lively to call Tommy.”  My father in law is having the darnedest time remembering that or even pronouncing the new words for him “Alexa”, “ask”, and “Lively.” You can’t deviate, you have to nail it! Apparently he never uses the word ask it’s always tell, and Alexa was an obscure name in 1945 but Alexis was fairly popular!If we could get it to call me when he says, “Alexis, call Tommy” or even, “Alexis, tell your buddy to call Tommy” that would be great.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Leghornlife', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'So far so good', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this for my bedridden mother-in-law to use in her nursing home.

I bought a defective phone from you which was supposed to be a new phone but I can not use it. First, it would not charge for two days the first week I got. I tried all the chargers in the house, and it would not charge. The next morning, the battery finally died. I had planned to buy another phone but decided to try charging it again then it came on so I thought the problem was over. When I traveled, I did not use it for 6 days because there was no WIFI, so I  have barely used this phone that is now stuck with me.The next thing I experienced on Sunday was no connectivity. There was no reception almost all day on Sunday, and today, I am having the same issue.I tried to print out a return label on Sunday  as soon as I came home, but there was only one place on your website to drop it off. There was an option to choose my own drop off location, but each time I typed the locations in the space provided, it would not go through so I was stuck with your drop off location choice which was Georgia Tech, an hour away from me. On Monday morning, when I  went back online to  try again, the return space was closed. Why was the last day of return the 21st instead of the 22nd? Why would you set it up like you have only to have one location available and nothing else? Is it to make me get stuck with the phone? Well, you have succeeded. What if I lived in Augusta, Georgia, how was I supposed to drop it off at Georgia Tech?The reason why I bought this phone was because it was unlocked so I could use it when I traveled out of the country. My trip was from April 6 - 21. So I had little to no chance of returning this phone because you have only one drop off location on your site. Now, I am stuck with it and can not use it because it is defective, and I have to buy another phone. I hope you enjoy the money knowing you sold a junk phone to me.As I type, I am using my WIFI because the phone is not receiving any connections.

I certainly didn't want to jump into the 1st few generations of a flip phone since I wasn't convinced about the folding screen quality and durability. But the tech is much better now and the folding screen isn't so hard to get used to.The specs say this phone is solid. Maybe just a half step down from a flagship phone. I thought that between the Samsung Galaxy flip 5 and this phone that my wife would opt for the Samsung as she's been using Samsung for the past 3 or 4 phones. I was surprised when she agreed to go with the razr.In terms of specs, the flip 5 has a slightly better processor but you can't tell a difference in real life. Same ram and memory for the same MSRP. The inside screen is comparable with the flip 5 being a little brighter but both are clear and sharp and offer a very nice viewing experience. You need to get used to the crease. Buying a flip phone, the crease in the screen is inevitable. When doing any surfing, I find my wife and I forget about the crease. In fact, she hasn't said a thing about it since the 1st day.The outside screen on the razr is hands down better. It allows better screen customization than the flip 5 and it's slightly bigger. It's also a higher resolution screen than the flip 5. I like how you can put almost any app on the small outside screen. You must use the stock keyboard for typing on the outer screen but that's fine. It's a full qwerty keyboard. Fat fingers will struggle but if you are petite like my wife, it's just fine. For anything quick like responding to a text, the phone stays closed and she responds on the outer screen. For anything more time consuming and intensive, flip it open and do your thing.My wife was getting tired of the big phone. The s21 ultra was big enough that she always had to think about which purse to take. Small purses weren't really options. That's why I thought I'd steer her towards a flip phone. It's so nice and compact and this magenta color is really sharp. Perfect for her. Today she went for a walk. No keys. Just her phone and earbuds. It was perfect cuz she had small shorts with small pockets and the phone fit with room to spare. Any other phone would have fallen out.I have thought about downsizing the phone myself. But really, if you can deal with the crease on the main screen, it's still a big screen at 6.9 inches and bigger than most of the modern phones. That's plenty big when you flip it open. But it folds so small that it fits nicely in your pocket. It's thicker than the current phones when folded up but thinner when open.Almost forgot to mention, when we were looking at the flip 5 and the razr, one thing I didn't like about the flip was how much the camera stuck out. The flip has squared sharp edges while the razr has rounded edges. So the razr is sleeker. The rounded edges of the razr let's it sit in the hands better than the squared off edges of the flip 5. Both have a power button fingerprint reader. I don't know how sensitive the flips reader is but the razr is really sensitive and fast.I know the reviews say the flip 5 camera takes better pictures. Maybe when you compare side by side but by no means does the razr take bad pictures. This is getting nitpicky. Sure, you are allowed to critique what you spend your money on but the reality is, the camera is just fine on the razr. I have not put it to the test. My upcoming vacation should allow me to see how good the camera is. I have no doubts my pixel camera will be better but it was better than the s21 ultra too (and just about any phone I've tested). Thus far, my wife hasn't said anything negative about the pictures she has taken. But we're not super duper picky.If you buy this phone fully understanding the limits of a flip phone and it's advantages and do not have unreal expectations, I think this phone is almost perfect. If I needed a new phone, I would definitely consider this one though I'd probably wait for the newest model due out mid year in 2024. I've always loved the razr line even dating back to the original flips Motorola used to make. Seeing that iconic name back in play with a new modern day phone has really perked my interest. I'm just really glad it has lived up to my expectations.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Julie', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Handy and Stylish', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024', 'Review Body': ""When I first saw this new phone, I thought it was a gimmick.

I have had it both in personal time and took it to work in an industrial setting, and it feels solid and can take a little bit of abuse. Recommend a case though. Highly recommend this phone for anyone looking to free up some pocket space. I\'ll compose a small list of pros and cons below.PROS:- It folds!- Screens are bright and easy to look at- Feels very sturdy overall- Wireless charging is not fast, but a nice perk- It can play games and high quality videos smoothlyNEUTRAL:- Sturdy, but the hinge feels a bit flimsy when partially opened, just be careful- Battery life isn\'t the best, but it does charge quickly so keep a charger close by- Random people WILL want to ask questions and ""look at it"" when out in public- No charging brick or factory protector in box (took a page from Apple)CONS:- The hinge may be the thing that gives out in time- Not many customization options, but there is just enough- A little tough to find a case that actually stays on- Cameras and UI could be better, but it operates like a Moto should- Not worth the $999 price, but totally worth the sale priceWell that\'s a brief rundown of how I feel about it so far. Overall I love it, just hope they refine a few more things in the future, I may keep buying Razr for a while. I will update this review as needed, but this is after a month of use. And as far as a case goes, GET A CASE, thank me later. I went through three cases, but the cheap Cresee brand case (sold on Amazon) is the best one so far. Hope this helps someone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Margarita', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on November 29, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Muy bien el producto, En el paquete solo faltó el cargador.

Great flip phone, works well for texting and calling. Camera is surprisingly great, about the quality of the iPhone 4/5.

Google maps is functional and is convenient in dire circumstances. I chose the unlimited talk and text plan, and after auto-refilling, it came out to only $15 a month.One problem: It seems others have had this issue—occasionally the screen will go to static or black and everything will crash. Sometimes the phone resets itself, but usually the only fix is to remove the battery, put it back in again, and turn on the phone. This is my go-to way to hard-reset the phone. It happens about once a week or so.After only ever owning a smartphone, this was a great change. I find myself reading more and spending less time online.

It has T9 capabilities, but you have to change that in settings first, as it is set to predictive text straight out of the box. It comes with google maps and an appstore (albeit limited, but there are some great apps on there like a podcast player and a pdf viewer that work just fine!). There is no whatsapp on this phone, although the Nokia 6300 has it. It connects to wifi just fine, and the internet browser works great as well. It's sort of slow, so it keeps you from wasting time on frivolous doom scrolling. Youtube is available as well, and it plays videos quite decently. It has both a headphone jack and bluetooth capabilities. I don't think it has a hotspot though, but I haven't set up my mobile service so I can't comment on that.  I can't comment on the battery life yet either, as I've only had it for about a day. You can easily load music, video, and document files onto it by connecting it to your computer. All in all, it's a pretty solid phone for those who don't want to use a smartphone, but also need to be able to use internet functions when they are out and about.

I spent many hours trying to activate this phone.  I had the miniscule nano sim card that is required, and it is just that:  miniscule.  Make that VERY miniscule?  I must have dropped it 10 times.  The instructions say to ""insert it"" and show a diagram of WHERE, but they don\'t say HOW.  To anyone who is as ignorant as I am about such things, please stick something sharp and thin down in that metal ""pocket"" where the nano card goes, and lift it slightly, or like me, you\'ll struggle getting it inserted!  I kept just laying it on top of that pocket, because it looked like that was where it went in the diagram.  I\'d put the back on and then discover that was WRONG.  I defy you to remove that back 5 or 6 times like I had to, and have any thumbnails left.  I finally wised up (?) and used a dull knife to slide in between the front and back to open it, and there were little pieces of the plastic all over the counter from cutting pieces when trying to prize it loose all those times.The phone is NOT easy to use, once you get it activated, (activating it is another whole ballgame, btw.  That was fun... NOT!)  I\'ve spent hours trying to discover just how to make a call and type a text on the thing.  Still not sure how either of those is done.  I will say, the sound seems to be good and even with my hearing aids, easily heard.I use a p.c. and an iPad for hours every day, and have no problems with either.  This phone is a very confusing, strange piece of technology, but I had to have it for certain tasks after my old cellphone became obsolete.  It did everything, and never a problem till I couldn\'t use it anymore.Edit:  I\'m finally fed up with this NOT Easyfone, and am returning it.  It wouldn\'t make even a simple call without problems--like letting Walmart know I was there to pick up my grocery order.  Simply refused. Final straw was when I placed a call to a friend, and she said I sounded like I was underwater--and so did SHE!  Then a few seconds later, the phone cut out completely and she had to call me back on my landline.  Maybe it was just this phone or perhaps me, but I can\'t recommend this Easyfone.

This feature phone has no internet capabilities which is one of the special securities. But it could still get minor hacks through the SS7 Protocol Phone System like screen hacks and a shutdown the phone hack will turn into either a shutdown the mic hack or shut down the speaker or disrupts the speaker but for smartphones it just  shut it down and the only way to override that is to get pair of wired earbuds with a mic to put it in the 3.5 mm jack. To help keep these minor hacks down you can when have too  shut it down immediately which also reduces the chance of an illegal program from getting a trace. A feature phone can be turned off with the SIM card in it versus the smartphone. Because the smartphone has to be shut down and the SIM card is be taken out because it\'s standby mode it\'s still actually gets power .Bluetooth does work on the this phone but if you turn it on it can compromise  the feature phone.  Granted it has different Operating System than IOS or Android. It\'s Operating System is called an Interface. The feature phone will work with different GSM cellular SIM cards. The catch is to prevent cellular phone account erasings by not accepting cellphone providers app because that puts your phone account online to be erased. Only certain cellphone providers like AT&T (GSM) have two authentication to keep this from happening. Verizon wireless has three authentications but they\'re CDMA  which won\'t work on this feature phone. The texting is still very old school , it\'s not like a smartphone. I wish I could find either a wireless keyboard or USB wired keyboard to override that to make it easier but I haven\'t been able find one yet that\'s compatible. It can send receive text including receiving picture text but it\'s very small you can only see it with a really times 10 powered magnifying glass or if you have a computer hook it up to a computer to go through its files. It does have a micro SD slot I haven\'t checked that one out. Also once in awhile they\'ll be a light clear screen saying it can\'t find files on the side of the screen All you have to do is pop one into the battery out and then put it back in and then it\'ll actually function again. That doesn\'t happen a lot. Yeah you can set up ring and vibrate but some of these phones once in a while it might be touchy and you\'ll be wondering why it won\'t ring you got to look for the icon if there\'s a speaker with a slash through it and then go in there and turn it back on with that occurs. It does have alarm clock alarm clock settings and they do work. It does have a phone book that you can put contacts into. You could read missed calls through the green phone icon. Certain types of metal siding buildings prevents you from making calls in, you have to go outside the building to get a signal. If you make a phone call and for some reason it says, ""You\'re unable to make calls to this phone number."" just hang up and just redial again and it\'ll just make the call so long it\'s not international. The FM radio does work. It just has to do a search and it just starts working or preset FM radio channels to be saved. There\'s an option to play in background and you can manually search channels also. It does have an SOS feature for elderly people. people. It has a future called human voice which reads out phone numbers to you. Now if you don\'t want that playing to so people here phone numbers make sure it\'s shut off. And settings you can always reset the date and time and settings, set language, set sound settings, display settings, call settings and it has a setting for network settings and security settings. Overall for for basic functionality it does work but it can protect you long enough till you can get portable internet and a portable internet phone number from Vonage if your smartphone you doesn\'t have Wi-Fi calling.

Luckily, I had a pin small enough to open the slot to remove the tray to add the cards. The second, I had some difficulty setting up the phone. It wasn't connecting to my Wifi signal and it was also giving me issues logging into my Google account for set up. My previous phone I didn't have such a difficult time with that. It took awhile, but once everything was finished it was working great.Overall, I'm satisfied with the product.

Ich hatte es schon einmal interessant gefunden aber nicht gekauft, weil ich damals noch kabelgebundene Kopfhörer hatte und dieses Handy keinen Klinkenanschluss hat.Ich bin insgesamt zufrieden mit diesem Handy. Es hat ein paar Eigenheiten. Z. B. hat es eine vorinstallierte Radio App, die man weder deinstallieren noch deaktivieren kann. Da es aber keinen Klinkenanschluss gibt, kann man logischerweise keine kabelgebundenen Kopfhörer anschließen, um die Radio App zu nutzen. ^^Auch suspekt finde ich, dass das Handy einen krass lauten Lautsprecher aber keine vorinstallierte App zum Abspielen von Musik hat.Den linken Knopf finde ich cool. Man kann ihn selbst programmieren. Man kann ihn einmal kurz drücken, gedrückt halten und zweimal kurz drücken. Und für alle drei Optionen kann man eigene Funktionen verknüpfen. Entweder öffnet man damit eine App oder schaltet die Taschenlampe ein oder macht einen Screenshot. Das ist recht praktisch.Die Kamera ist ziemlicher Käse. Aber da das in meinem Fall ein Ersatzhandy ist, spielt das für mich keine Rolle. Wenn man ein Handy sucht um unterwegs schöne Fotos zu machen, ist dieses Handy die falsche Wahl.Das Handy ist echt groß. Ich habe sehr große Hände (Handschuhgröße 11/12) und es ist genauso groß, wie meine Handfläche. Und ziemlich schwer. Für kleine Hände und/oder Jogginghosen ist das also nichts.Vermutlich der Grund für das Gewicht: Der Akku hält echt lang. Ich bekam es mit 80% geladenem Akku und musste es erst nach 3 Tagen mit 15 % aufladen.Die Übersetzung ist an manchen Stellen nicht ganz perfekt. In den Kamera-Einstellungen steht z. B. Unter der Spiegeln Option: ""Nur funktioniert mit Front Kamera."" :DIch gebe 4 Sterne. Warum? (Natürlich subjektiv)Positiv:Mir gefällt das Gewicht irgendwie. Ich nutze es auf lange Sicht sowieso nur daheim.Der Akku hält echt lang.Programmierbare Taste.Lautsprecher kann sehr laut gestellt werden.Speicherplatz ist völlig ausreichend für eigene Apps.Wirkt durch das stabile Gehäuse sehr robust.Neutral:Kamera ist schlecht.

It has 128gb of storage, which is enough to accommodate a large number of photos, videos and applications, while 8+8 GB memory ensures the smooth operation of the system and smoother multitasking. The equipped MT8788 processor performs well in daily use and gaming experience, allowing me to easily enjoy smooth operation and efficient processing speed.The phone has an IP68 waterproof design and can maintain normal operation whether it rains or accidentally falls into water. This gives me confidence to use my phone when doing outdoor activities or travelling. What amazed me the most was the amazing 10600mAh battery capacity. I used 3 days without connecting to the charger. It allows me to no longer worry about charging issues frequently. It can last long time after one single charge.However, even with all the advantages, first of all, due to a large capacity of the charger, the overall weight of the phone is relatively heavy, which makes it inconvenient to hold by one hand for a long time. I need to switch hand or hold by 2 hands after a while.Overall, I've had a great experience with the phone, and pros clearly outweigh the cons. It's high performance, waterproof design and long battery life make it more convenient for me to deal with the various scenes in daily life.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jeana', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Does not work with Cricket', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Wasn't sure if it would work with Cricket but the AI said maybe.

Don\'t be tempted to click through all the options without reading first!Nice that it comes with a screen protector built in (though it\'s a finger print collector) and it comes with a very basic flexible clear plastic case to cover the back.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on December 22, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Precio justo barato y funcional, funciona correctamente.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Osvaldo X.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on December 21, 2021', 'Review Body': 'El teléfono cumplio con mis espectativas, funciono bien, hasta el día 19 de agosto 2022, cuando comenzó a fallar, (prácticamente solo me aguanto 9 meses) jamás lo descuide ni golpes ni mojadas, solo comenzó a reiniciar y ya no enciende.\nRead more'}]",MediaTek Helio,60 Hz,G10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

You have to activate it with Lively, it cannot be used on any other service.It is large enough for most people to see the screen well.  It has a clear and simple menu, which can be adjusted as needed in the options. For a Senior who can learn, it will not take much effort to master the phone. Since it is an android, some features from google are available. An account from google will help transfer contacts to the phone. It is able to share location with other users of Google Maps without purchasing the Lively upgrade to track the phone location in a separate app. We are not using the advanced emergency response services from Lively yet but expect to in the future.For Seniors who cannot learn there are a couple of issues. It does not have a lift to wake feature, requiring the push button on the side to be pressed. This can be confusing for a person with some dementia to learn if they are transitioning from an Iphone to this phone.  Another issue is the contact list provided through Google contacts permits favorites which are displayed on the top of the list if you open contacts, or if you open the phone app, but not if you open texts. These minor differences may be hard to learn for someone without a memory. The solution is probably to delete all of the contacts except a few critical ones, and eliminate the favorites.  It is also possible to turn off the lock screen to make access simpler, but it will have no security at that point.We will see how it works, and I may update this review. At this point it appears to be the best option for a simple phone with actual features.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dean C.', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': '100% Scam', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this phone (& I use that term lightly) for my elderly Mother with cognitive issues due to MS.

Even though it's a budget phone, the display feels much more expensive.The phone feels nice to hold, and the design is sleek and modern. I love that it doesn’t feel bulky in my hand, and the large screen makes everything so much easier to see and interact with.Using the Xgody X31 has been smooth and pretty enjoyable. Apps open quickly, and I haven’t experienced any major lag, even when switching between multiple apps. I’m not a heavy gamer, but for daily tasks like messaging, browsing, and watching videos, it works perfectly fine.One thing I really appreciate is the battery life. I can go more than two days without needing to charge it, which is a huge relief. I’m not constantly worried about my phone dying while I’m out and about.The face unlock feature is a nice touch—it’s quick and convenient, and I’ve gotten used to it very quickly. The cameras are decent too; they’re not going to replace a high-end camera, but for capturing quick photos and selfies, they do the job just fine.Overall, using this phone has been a positive experience.

However, I haven't stress-tested it yet to see if it can handle mid-level Play Store games.I had a poor experience with their A4 model, which was extremely laggy with even basic apps, likely due to its lower 2GB RAM and minimal ROM.

I’m hopeful this model will perform better, but it’s only day two, so I’m still testing and debloating the pre-installed apps. I’ll update my findings as I continue to use it.

No, it's not worth it."", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I understand you get what you pay for because I have been buying cheap phones for years. But, this phone is by far the worst.Out of the box, I couldn\'t even configure the most basic option, color theme. Yeah, the option under wallpaper & style? Not there. Is this a Blu issue or Android issue - I don\'t know but it\'s kind of ridiculous that something that simple is missing. I\'m literally stuck with the pink theme and I can\'t change it (yes, I have the most up to date Android installed). I could live with the pink theme so long as the damn phone worked. But, it barely does that.First off, the power/screenshot/lock button is a mess. It\'s impossible to get it to do what I want with any consistency. It\'s too sensitive and poorly designed. It is by far the most frustrating feature on this phone.Next, are the random reboots. I try to get a screenshot and the phone reboots. I go to lock my screen, the phone reboots. Just today, it\'s rebooted 3 times. And I\'m not holding the button down long enough for this to be happening. Quick button presses should not be causing multiple reboots.Then we have the speaker and microphone. The sound coming out of this phone is like an AM radio from 1970. The microphone is just as bad. I used to be able to drive hands free but now I can\'t because anyone I try to talk to tells me they can barely hear me. It doesn\'t matter how close I get to the microphone or how quiet my surroundings are. They simply can\'t hear me.I also read someone else complaining about this phone and 5ghz Wifi. They are absolutely correct. When this phone was on the 5ghz frequency of my Wifi, it constantly dropped the signal. It would repeatedly flip back and forth between strong/weak signal, then drop it all together. Then reconnect and do the same thing over and over. The wireless access point was only a few feet away and not obstructed by anything.I\'m *very* disappointed in this phone. This thing is a nightmare. I do not recommend buying this phone at any price.2 month update:It\'s gotten worse. Now the WiFi randomly drops out on the 2.4ghz range. No warning. One minute it\'s connected, the next, I\'m on cellular. When I reconnect to my WiFi it displays ""!"" next to the WiFi status and has no Internet access. I have to restart my phone or it will stay like this no matter what I do.Speaking of restarting the phone, I still suffer from random reboots, and more recently, have noticed that it\'s been getting laggy. I don\'t install much on my phone. I don\'t game, and I don\'t use any resource intensive apps - so there\'s no reason for this phone to be getting laggy. None.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing. It is absolute garbage. Do NOT buy this phone.Final update:Had this phone a total of 5 months, 16 days and it\'s done. The WiFi on 5ghz or 2.4ghz is so bad, it\'s almost useless. I live in an area with very poor cell coverage so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. I just ordered a new phone today because I had no choice. It\'s money I really did not want to spend but, I need a phone that\'s capable of maintaining a solid WiFi connection. You can say it\'s a pretty safe bet that I won\'t be buying anything from Blu again.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'House', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone Great Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Wonderful phone I bought on sale at 40 on Amazon used “ clean no scratches “As soon 🔜 I installed the sim card and turn it on start working,But be prepared and patience because you will need to do at  leat 4 software upgrade until you reach Android 13What I like the most is that sim tray you can put 2 sim cards and the SD card at the same time, not like the other phones that offers you 2 sim but is a sim card and  SD card or 2 sim cardGreat I Like a lot and for that price is great\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alique', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'BLU G73 | 2023', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'great value, works fine.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sandra Hally', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Nice phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It was a nice phone with a nice camera along with nice price but it doesn't connect with Verizon cellular service like it said it would\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'T.c.', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Nice screen  size', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This is a nice phone for the price does its job, for it to have 3 cameras im not sure how well the pictures come out , maybe i need to adjust some settings.

I still recommend getting a screen protector and case, because not everything is full proof. Kids can still do the impossible. So bare that in mind.It's a shame that the main company Bullitt Group went out of business and is no longer supporting this device which means the proprietary apps provided won't work. However, the proprietary apps were redundant anyway. You can get the same features just by downloading apps from the Google Play Store.Please note that this device runs on Android 11 OS which is no longer being supported by Android as of Feb 2024 which means you'll won't be getting future security updates anytime soon. However many apps will still run from the Google Store which I have trial and tested. Therefore, you'll have many years of good usage. In addition, I will state that we were able to get the last updates of Android 11 and related security features.I do love the fact that this device has a reprogrammable button where you can set it to open or use any feature. The camera is a bit slow to focus, but takes good quality pictures. The sound quality is good, but not very loud in a noise environment when listening to apps. Speaker phone however is perfect. It has good reception, wifi and bluetooth connections.The price is affordable with plenty of additional storage options. I am able to use a 256gb Micro SD.

It’s actually made of metal to help with the ruggedness/durability.  The camera lenses are also recessed slightly from the body by 0.6mm to provide added protection if you lay your phone down flat either face up or face down.There are 2 contact points on the back cover.  I believe these are charging contacts when placed into a dock or some sort.The sides/edges are all aluminum.  It provides a very premium look/feel to the phone.  Unfortunately, the aluminum feels smooth/slick in the hands and therefore not very secure when held, but the rounded edges does make it comfortable to hold.The back cover is made of plastic with a knurled patch on the lower half to provide added grip.  I do wish the same material wrapped around the sides so the phone would feel more secure in my hands.The phone weighs approx. 258g, which is actually not that bad as my Samsung S23FE with case is actually 259g, so it’s not as heavy as expected.The buttons all feel like metal, which adds to the phone's premium feel.  They have knurling on the power and feature button to provide a different feel vs the smooth volume buttons.  It may provide extra grip when pressing, but I think it’s more to differentiate between the buttons.The position of the volume/power buttons seem to be reversed vs other mobile phones I’ve used/seen.  The power button is on top while the volume is on bottom.  This is definitely a bit confusing and something I will need to get used to.All the buttons are very tactile and provides a slight click when pressed so you know when you pressed a button.The bottom of the phone contains the USB-C charging port as well as the single down firing speaker.The left of the device houses the cover for the SIM & MicroSD tray and an orange feature button.  When I took the phone out of the box, I noticed that the SIM tray cover was open.  I just thought it wasn’t closed when shipped but found out quickly that it automatically reopens on its own after 20-30mins.  Seems there’s a slight defect with the product as this will affect the water resistance of the phone.  The feature button can be setup for different functions depending on how it’s pressed.  It can be setup to open specific apps and the system provides a list of options.Comes with a USB-C wall charger, which is rare to see these days.Boot-up/Setup:On first power on, you see a T-Mobile logo.  Setup is similar to any other Android phone.  Once setup is complete, reboots/power on only takes approx. 30secs to get into the OS, which is significantly faster than current flagship phones.The screen is clear but does seem a bit dimmer than other rugged phones I have tested even with the brightness at 100%.The phone came with Android 10, but it did detect and installed Android 11 without issue.When checking the settings, it indicated that the phone was locked to T-Mobile.  When I selected the option to permanently unlock, it unfortunately produces a “Server Error: Error Code 255”.  I inserted my active SIM card and still shows as locked.  I read some other product reviews, and someone indicated that the phone showed locked but was still able to make calls and access cellular data.  I didn’t even try to test, but with the SIM installed, it actually worked properly.  I was able to make calls and surf the internet without issues, so it does look like the phone is unlocked even though the phone reports it as locked to T-Mobile.It was able to achieve an LTE+ connection and running a speed test was able to hit over 30mbps download speeds.I’m not a fan of the stock Android OS interface as it feels clumsy (to me) vs the custom interface provided by Samsung, including the applications.  Customization is a bit limited in some areas (e.g. changing the lock screen wallpaper & home screen wallpaper to match).Fingerprint Reader:The fingerprint reader on the back detects my fingerprint very quickly and approx. 98% of the time.  There were a few times it did not detect, some because I didn’t contact the full sensor while others just didn’t read it.  Overall, detection is good and the screen unlocks quickly.I find the actual fingerprint sensors better than the on-screen sensors.  This is a defined location that is fairly hard to miss while you may miss the on-screen sensor depending on how you hold the phone.  They’re also affected by screen protectors.  I would probably prefer if the sensor was on the power button as that doesn’t require the phone to be picked up in order to unlock like the sensor on the back of the phone.Speaker:The single down firing speaker at the bottom of the phone is surprisingly powerful.  It doesn’t contain a lot of bass, but depending on how the phone is positioned, you can get some very loud audio.  Holding the phone in portrait (upright) the speaker will blast the audio towards you.  Placing the phone flat on the table in portrait or landscape (upright/sideways) will cause the audio to reflect off the table and back up at you making the audio louder.  But, if you hold the phone in landscape (sideways) with your hand (not on the speaker side), it won’t reflect the audio back at you and you lose a good 25% of the volume level.  And, if you accidently cover the speaker with your finger, you lose a good 75% or more, so be careful not to cover the speaker grille.Cameras:The rear of the device shows 2 camera lenses, but the system only reports as 1 camera mode, so I’m not sure what the 2nd lens is for.  I went through all the modes and found that only the bottom lens is real & functional.  Another bad item is that the lenses are made of plastic.  It’s more shatter resistant in a fall, but prone to scratches.The product specs indicate the main camera is 48MP, but the actual camera’s settings indicate it’s actually 12MP using quad pixel technology.  Basically, it uses 4 adjacent pixels to make 1 image pixel called pixel binning, so the image quality is supposed to look better using a lower megapixel camera sensor.  The front camera is correctly labelled as 8MP.Taking pictures with the main camera and I found that it doesn’t handle exposure correctly.  When focusing the camera on a brighter light source, the entire image will dim and depending on how bright it is, will dim down to the point the surrounding image is so dark you can only see the bright source.  I found later that this is when in room light situations.  When outside on a sunny day, it does a better job.Pictures are surprisingly decent.  I compared images with my Samsung S23FE and took a photo of a seat cushion, I found this phone capture clearer/sharper images of the surface of the cushion while the Samsung blurred the surface via its software processing to give it a softer/blurrier look.Videos on the main camera are not the best only recording at only 1080p @ 2MP.  As mentioned above the auto exposure is not great and darkens videos when you don’t want them darkened.  You can see a lot of shimmering/noise around surface edges (trees, buildings, cars & people) and pretty much anything that moves.The front camera is spec’d at 8MP.  Selfies are ok but contains a lot of noise throughout the image.  It looks to be over sharpened to try to increase the detail levels.  Something in a pinch and it’s fine, but I wouldn’t use this for my main camera while on vacation as permanent memories is where you want as much quality and detail as you can get, and this front camera will not provide that level of detail.  Again, this mainly depends on how much light there is, the brighter it is the sharper the image.I did notice that for some reason when recoding videos with the front camera in Portrait orientation, my head/face is squished down so my face is wider than it should be.  Details around me seem OK, but there’s no real comparative vs a face.  I placed just my hand and the same issue.  I tested in Landscape orientation and found everything looked correct, so there’s definitely something wrong with the camera or software that just doesn’t like portrait mode in the front selfie camera.  That’s a disappointment as this is probably the orientation most will use when taking a selfie as it’s the easiest position to hold the phone.Main Camera Photo Details:- Dimensions: 3000 x 4000- Mega Pixels: 12MP (Quad Pixel)- Resolution: 72dpi- Bit Depth: 24- File Size: 4.42MB- File Extension: JPGSelfie Camera Photo Details:- Dimensions: 2448 x 3264- Mega Pixels: 8MP- Resolution: 96dpi- Bit Depth: 24- File Size: 2.36MB- File Extension: JPGMain Camera Video Details:- Dimensions: 1920 x 1080 (or 1080 x 1920 in Portrait Orientation)- Mega Pixels: 2.1MP- Video Bit Rate: 9671kbps (may go up/down depending on environment lighting conditions)- Frame Rate: 30fps- Audio Bit Rate: 101kbps- Channels: 2 (Stereo)- Audio Sample Rate: 48kHz- File Size: 8.54MB for 7secs of video- File Type: MP4Front Selfie Camera Video Details:- Dimensions: 1920 x 1080 (or 1080 x 1920 in Portrait Orientation)- Mega Pixels: 2.1MP- Video Bit Rate: 8962kbps (may go up/down depending on environment lighting conditions)- Frame Rate: 30fps- Audio Bit Rate: 94kbps- Channels: 2 (Stereo)- Audio Sample Rate: 48kHz- File Size: 15.5MB for 13secs of video- File Type: MP4Performance:I ran a few benchmark tests to see how it stacked up.  I was surprised to see it didn’t perform that well vs other older model phones.- 3DMark Sling Shot Test: 1863 (a Samsung Galaxy S7 from 2016 had a rating of 2908)- AnTuTu 3DBench Lite v10.2.1:  o Marooned – OpenGL ES 3.0 (Onscreen=9.54fps, Offscreen=8.81fps)  o Coastline – OpenGL ES 3.0 (Onscreen=9.89fps, Offscreen=8.71fps)- GeekBench6: CPU-Single Core=318, Multi Core=1239 / GPU=252- PCMark: Work 3.0 Performance=6178 (Samsung S7 from 2016 had a rating of 5021)The performance numbers weren’t great as it has trouble outperforming a phone released 2016.  Yes, it was a flagship phone at its release, but I would have hoped something released in 2021 would beat something that came out 7 years earlier.Based on the gaming numbers, the phone is not meant for gaming.  Very basic stuff will work, but not more graphics intensive games as it was only able to get just below 10fps.Using it to view videos on YouTube and surf the internet is perfectly fine.  There is some lag when loading additional videos/graphics but is still ok.Moving around in the phone, swiping screen, taking photos, switching menus all seem fine.  There is some lag for the camera to load images from the gallery and open the editor, but again, this is not a flagship phone.Using my USB-C power meter, I was able to find out that the phone will draw a maximum of approx. 17W while charging.  It’s not a fast-charging phone, but still reasonable.Battery runtime on the phone dropped approx. 10% when performing the benchmark tests.  After approx. 4 days, with light usage taking photos, moving around on the phone menus and setting it up, watching YouTube and listening to music, the battery finally dropped down to approx. 14%.  All that time the phone was connected to WiFi but had no SIM card.  The phone seems to drop almost 6-8% every day while on standby with the screen off and minimal to no use.Durability Test:I tested the ruggedness of the phone by performing a couple tests, a water dunk as well as a drop test.  This always makes me nervous but it needs to be done.I was probably more worried about the water dunk test because of the issue with the SIM tray cover popping open on its own after some time.  If water was going to get in, this is where it will happen.  Luckily, the cover has been staying closed for longer with more use and me pressing down on it every time I use the phone.  This is definitely something that needs to be addressed in the factory.For the water test, I filled a container full of water and dropped the phone in while it was recording a video.  I was happy to see that it successfully passed the dunk test.  The touch screen worked but did have some recognition issues when I touched the screen while there were water drops moving around on the screen.  I needed to wipe off some of the water before it registered my swipes.  The speaker was probably the only thing affected by the water as it cut the audio volume way down.  Luckily, this was only temporary as once the water was cleared out (or dried up) the output volume returned.The drop test was next.  This is always an iffy one, if the design is lacking then that means the phone will crack/break and that’s it for the phone.I setup the phone in my kitchen at approx. countertop height (36”) and started the recording on the phone.  I held it on the corner to try to get the phone impact the hard tile floor on its edge.  The phone drops and it struck the corner and survived.  Looking at the phone I could see a ding on the corner/edge.  On closer inspection, the dent was at the top edge towards the screen and there was a dent.  It moved closer to the glass, but not enough to cause an issue.  The phone was still working, and the video was still recording, so it looks like it withstood the abuse.Pros:- IP68 & MIL-SPEC 810H Certified for water/dust resistance and drop/impact resistance.- Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen glass.- Very nice looking design with an all-aluminum frame.- Comfortable to hold with the rounded edges.- Durable, can take a drop from at least countertop height onto hard tile with only a scuff/dent in the frame but the phone was still 100% functional.- Supports a MicroSD card up to 256GB for added storage.- Surprisingly comes with a USB-C charging adapter & USB-C to USB-C charging cable.  Not only that, it also comes with a small USB-C to USB-A dongle so you can plug your phone into any computer/wall adapter using the USB-A connector.  This is definitely a welcomed bonus.- Not as heavy as expected at only 258g as current flagship phones are slightly lighter but can’t take a hit like this phone.- Photo quality from its main 12MP camera (not actually 48MP) is actually not bad.- Audio is fairly loud for a single down firing speaker.- Decent battery runtimeCons:- One major QC fail is with the SIM Tray cover.  It’s supposed to keep the device watertight, but unfortunately, there’s a design issue or a problem with the one on my phone as it doesn’t stay inserted into the phone.  I noticed this when I opened the box but just thought it was left that way during packing, but after approx. 20mins, the cover pops completely open exposing the innards to water, dust and dirt.  QC definitely needs to be improved at the factory to prevent major issues like this.- The back cover is plastic, which helps its impact resistance, but I found knocking on it, it sounded a bit hallow.- OS is limited to Android 11 and doesn’t look like it will be getting any more security updates.- Processor is a few years old, so not the best performer.- Front selfie camera quality lacking in normal light conditions.  Photos are usable but has a lot of noise.  Better quality appears when photos taken on a very sunny day.- No 3.5mm headphone jack that is available on other rugged phones.- Camera is marketed as a 48MP camera, but it’s actually a 12MP sensor, so a bit misleading.- Videos taking using the main rear camera only records at 1080p @ 2.1MP, which produces average quality images with a lot of noise.- Front camera can’t take proper videos in Portrait orientation.  The video is compressed so items seem wider than they should be.  It does work fine in Landscape orientation, so a problem with the camera or software.Final Impression:Overall, the CAT S62 rugged phone worked well.  Comfortable to hold, doesn’t look like a rugged phone, but capable of being dunked in water and dropped onto the floor without major damage (slight ding).  It’s not a gaming phone or anywhere near a flagship but if you don’t have a flagship phone next to it to compare, the phone does work fairly well opening/switching apps, watching videos and moving around on the phone menus.  Photos aren’t the best but is actually ok.  Videos on the other hand are a bit sub-par in my opinion.  The major flaw for my phone was the issue with the SIM slot cover opening up on its own after some time.  This can really affect its waterproof status and damage the phone, so better QC is definitely required.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Olivier', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on April 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Nice phone.

Well, I broke it trying it myself. LOL. So I needed a new phone, and didn't want another Moto (it already got its one and only Android update) so I heard good things about this Samsung. It has 5G (though not at my house, but I never really leave, and on US Mobile w/their Verizon SIM, wifi works perfectly for calls, SMS, & even MMS).This Samsung has a lower resolution display than the Moto had (720p vs. 1080p), but I don't even notice. This phone is MUCH brighter (the Moto was so dim, even on high, so awful when outside). The cameras are very nice on this, with fun features, & the macro camera is much better then the Moto's. I did prefer the tiny hole punch front facing camera on the Moto, though.The fingerprint reader works quicker and more accurately than the Moto. And this has a bigger battery, which is nice.The Moto came with Android 10 and upgraded to 11 (and that's it). This came with 11, 12 will be here in a couple weeks, and it will eventually get 13, so even though this phone came out a year ago, I'm happy about the updates it'll get.

The quick start guide is pointless.  For example, I got this so that I could expand the memory with an SD card.  The ""quick start"" has NO mention of where that might go.  No hint at all.  The first thing you\'re supposed to do, according to the front side of the quick start guide is put in a SIM card.  Um...  huh?  Where is THAT? The reverse of that page tells you if you want help, get premium care service.  Go to THAT page and they won\'t let you go further until you enter numbers that you can ONLY obtain by turning the phone on and going to another page (which they do NOT tell you how to get to).  This is not a phone for anyone who doesn\'t set up phones for a living.UPDATE, hour later:  I managed to find a number to talk to Samsung.  The first person gave me a couple of not very helpful factoids, then pretended to  no longer hear me and I think hung up.  She also could apparently only speak in mumble, despite pleas to speak clearly.  A survey came on, asked about my experience, and refused to take the lowest score (so don\'t believe Samsung customer satisfaction ""results"").  The second person -- and be aware that each of these calls puts you through a wait period -- was helpful at least, but the jargon was pretty dense and I\'m more confused than ever and don\'t feel there were very many straight answers.  He might have thought they were...  but the jargon made it very difficult to figure out.  I finally just gave up asking questions.  We did ""set up"" the phone, but skipped a LOT of steps which he assured me I could take care of later...  but it is something I\'m going to have to figure out, apparently, on my own.  I am facing an extremely steep learning curve.  I have no idea how anything is supposed to get from the old phone to the new one -- he says maybe but I don\'t think we did anything to  transfer any data let alone files or apps.He claimed that they don\'t send out instructions in order to protect the environment.  Balderdash:  he told me also to print out the instructions he emailed.Finally, this is pretty slow -- much slower than my old Motorola.  And the touchscreen is mercurial.

The headphone jack is something I really prefer as the price of blue tooth speakers being lost by accident can add up. With a separate jack you can have BOTH headphone and charging cable in at the same time.The battery is of course great. Thiner phones mean thiner batteries. This thick boy gives you meat for your power.Software wise it is current enough to do me for years. My last phone was an A8 of seven years ago.The dollar price here on amazon was $200 compared to my cell provider MSRP $327 or $11 for 24 months of contract. That at the provider wanted a six month of $200 deposit as I am rather new to them. The deposit they wanted alone was the purchase price.If you going to get a valise (fold over cover) dont worry about the shell color as so little would show.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'jana', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 30, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've had it for a month now and I really like it.

What I did not realize was that I had purchased an international version. I didn't even know what that meant. Apparently, there is no warranty on these phones. I have had the phone for a couple of months now and have not had a problem with it. Transfered the sim card fromthe old phone to this phone and was ready to go right away.

I purchased the Nokia for the sole reasoning to improve my habits of staring at that shattered glass screen for an unnecessary amount of time when I need that time to be productive and, well, connect with the world. But anyway, here are my pros and cons I noticed while using this phone over the weekend. (And some things to clarify after reading other reviews)Pros:-Calls sound good and you sound good on their end-SMS/MMS texts pop up on their end-All the advertised apps appeared and work decently (YouTube, Google Search/Maps, WhatsApp, QR Reader)-Snake is a classic as well as Crossy Road and Doodle Jump-FM Radio works well and sounds good too-Loaded music files via microSD storage all play seemlessly either with headphones or BluetoothCons:-No physical volume buttons, which kinda bothers me a little-Internet browser is very limited even when loading simple websites-Your group text responses send to each group member individually instead of the group (bug?)-Google Maps is text/manual navigation only for those who only rely on its voice assistant-Camera quality is fine but not the best for indoor photos-The promised apps will only show up if you insert the SIM card to the phone (makes sorta sense but not so much for WIFI only users)Transferring the SIM over from one phone to this one was simple. Since I have an iPhone, before using your SIM on the Nokia, go to the settings and uncheck your number to receive iMessages from (on Messages tab in the main Settings menu). After that, you should be able to send SMS and MMS messages from your Nokia at an ease.Well, that\'s about it! This phone, overall, is a 4/5 in my book. It is not entirely perfect, some flaws to be aware but a good phone to use overall. A good way to disconnect from the loud world every once in a while, or to slowly improve screen time. Probably both. I\'d recommend this to anyone, like me, who wants a backup phone to use, a replacement to ditch your smartphone entirely (you brave soul), or to parents who want their kids to get their first phone. Get yourself a cheap prepaid phone plan and begin that journey with this beloved little gadget.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'piyush trivedi', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'This is worst phone which damaged my SIM', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I Ordered this phone with considering it will work with T-Mobile & AT&T. but when i got this phone and i put my SIM in this phone.

I bought this phone primarily for its dual SIM feature, as I often need to use two different numbers – one for work and one personal. It’s been a game-changer, especially when traveling. I can easily switch between SIMs, and the phone handles both without any issues. The signal strength is impressive, even in areas where my previous phones struggled. No more dropped calls or weak connections – this phone keeps me connected no matter where I am.With 128 GB of internal memory, the DOOGEE N55 provides more than enough space for all my needs. I love taking photos and videos, and this phone lets me store everything without having to constantly manage my storage. Plus, I can download as many apps as I need without worrying about running out of space. The storage capacity is perfect for someone who uses their phone for both work and play.The battery life is another highlight of this phone. I’m amazed at how long it lasts on a single charge. Even with heavy usage throughout the day – like browsing, streaming, and using GPS – I rarely need to recharge before the day is over. This is especially convenient when I’m traveling or on the go, and I don’t always have easy access to a charger.In summary, the DOOGEE N55 is a fantastic phone that offers everything I need. The dual SIM feature is perfect for managing multiple numbers, the signal strength is consistently strong, and the 128 GB memory is more than enough for all my apps and media. Add to that the long-lasting battery, and you’ve got a phone that’s perfect for both travel and daily use. I’m extremely satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Antoo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on August 6, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Preso per mio padre ed va benissimo\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'BERREBI sabine', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on January 26, 2024', 'Review Body': ""J'ai acheté ce téléphone pour remplacer mon redmi qui était trop lent et qui n'avait pas assez de puissance.

From my testing the phone does very well, can run a few apps no problem and for the daily things it works great. The camera is more so on the lower end in my opinion.

You can also go the used phone route and pick like an iPhone or Samsung that\'s about three to five years old for this price range (under $200). But if you want something brand new and shiny, then there is pretty much one option, and that\'s generic phones from China. I have already reviewed a couple Doogee phones, and find them very decent phones for their price range, and this one is no different. What is different though, is that this phone right now as of me writing this review, has a $60 off coupon which turns the phone to only $130 plus tax. And for all the features and ""phone"" that you get from this, this is such an excellent value.First, I really like that they did not skimp on the specs, so you get 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of memory. Don\'t be fooled by the 20GB faux advertising - the extra 12GB is just virtual memory and doesn\'t behave like a phone with actual 20GB of RAM would. To sum it up simply, it allows you to have more apps open without them having to refresh/restart when you switch back to them, but doesn\'t make the phone any faster.The camera is decent if you shoot during the day or in situations with really good lighting. At night, it gets very soft and ""smushy"", or pixelated like a bad quality video stream. Good for posting on Facebook where they will smush the heck out of your photos anyways.I would extra recommend this phone if you have a business or situation where you wouldn\'t need this phone is your primary phone. It can be your business phone where the main goal is communication, and not like all the extra fun stuff you\'d do on your expensive phone. Or perhaps you need a burner phone for your nefarious ways and lifestyle. Then if something were to happen, being out $130 isn\'t so bad. It\'s especially great if you need to travel overseas and want that second phone as a peace of mind.\nRead more'}]",,90 Hz,N55 Plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

The reception was good. The highlight of this flip phone is its battery life… the battery last over 2 days before the battery starts to indicate it’s running low. It comes with a charger cord and box and a manual. Definitely a great buy especially for anyone that prefers to push buttons! (Not everyone especially up in age can hold a steady hand to work a smart phone. With this device you have more control where your are actually touching to navigate your phone call or messages) Again this is a Great Buy!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Unknown brand', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Never did work it sucks 4 out of 5 I would give that a one it needs to be pulled off of the shelves ASAP when they made that phone they just do some stuff together I quickly replaced that phone cuz you could not get it to do anything there's no working buttons on the inside for you to do anything you can't turn it up it only go so far it doesn't halfway answer it really really sucks\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dianna Williams', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good for people with Mobily problems', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'the flip has that extra safety for the screen.

( i use sto-card app to store store cards), to complete my purchase, I had to call my wife, get the sams club card number and make the purchase. this was very discouraging and after a week, i got cold feet and switched back to my samsung galaxy.This time around I have a samsung S22 and when the S24 was announced, I was very much tempted to go for it. samsung especially gives a good trade in price for old phones, i was offered $450. getting the S24 was no brainer. but again, i started thinking, how to make use of this opportunity to switch to a dumb phone so that i use my phone only for basic tasks and stop this mind numbing, screen staring addiction.my requirement was that i needed to use phone, text and WhatsApp. I have lot of international friends who communicate with me through whatsapp, so that was a must. later i felt i needed maps and an app to store my store cards. after much research and watching youtube videos , i decided to take the plunge.I am so glad i did and brought this phone. even thought this dura extreme plus phone says verizon, its an unlocked phone. i have spectrum mobile and swapping the sim card just made it work without any issues.its a basic phone, it runs android 10 i understood. following a youtube video, i unlocked the developer options and was able to sideload android apps by connecting to a pc and loading the apk files. i loaded whatsapp, Waze maps and sto card. ( see picture ). its been 2 weeks and i am a happy man reclaiming the time that would have been lost starting at my smart phone screen.some important points:1. not all features of WhatsApp work. text, picture messages, voice messages, WhatsApp web, WhatsApp app for mac ( WhatsApp for windows would also work, i haven't tested though.) all works. WhatsApp call / video call does not work. ( this is because WhatsApp incoming call has a jumping icon and i have not found a way to click it.). as a workaround, I use my mac t o make and receive WhatsApp voice / video calls. the phone app would still ring and notifies me of the incoming call. so if I am outside, i can still make a direct call to the person who did a WhatsApp call to me.2. i could nt make google maps work, but wayz worked. the interface is clunky to type and click, but it works, i need this only in an emergency. if i always plan my drives of the places i am going , taking notes on a post it note like the pre mobile days, it works. In fact, i am now more directionally and geographically sensitive, previously i would just stare at my google maps app and numb my mind not knowing where i am driving, now i feel i am in better control of my drives.3. the sto card app really works. i could nt sign in to google to retrieve all my cards, but the app lets take pictures of bar codes and store it, so i did. the other day when i used my flip phone in ShopRite, the checkout girl was like what, you can store cards in a flip phone???one thing i still miss is my YouTube music app. that didn't work, for some reason, login to google apps doesn't work in this phone. but i miss it only when i drive, so i listen to news / gospel / classical music these days when i drive. i am becoming a more calmer person. its liberating!if you are like me helpless about your iPhone or samsung smart phone taking over your life, this phone might save your life!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'John MILes', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Delivery was on time and friendly.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It's a cell phone.

The Punkt does basically two things: Phone calls, and text messages. The phone call quality is fantastic. The calls are very clear and loud. The speaker also works great. As for text messages, this phone is a big loser. The T9 typing works just fine, but the lack of MMS makes this almost unusable. If you are in a text group, you will not receive most messages and the ones you do will be hard to sort out. I just stopped responding to any group messages. That and the inability to see pictures or GIFS sent is a bummer (although this does work on the signal app, pidgeon. As for the signal app, it's terrible. It's so bad, it's not worth using at all. It's separate from the text app and only works with other people who also have signal which I think is about 10 people worldwide. Also, when you install this app, it will break any other instance you have of signal, so no more signal on desktop or a tablet. Your choices will be: highly restricted lousy Signal or no Signal at all.I gave this thing 3 stars because I think the people who buy it know what they are getting into. Altogether though, it's not very good at the limited things it claims to do. If they improved the texting, it would be expensive but acceptable. Without the texting working well, it's basically a very expensive telephone. If you can swallow your pretensions and just buy a cheap feature phone, you will be much better served.Update: 8/2021 I decided to update the firmware on this phone and after the update, the phone was bricked. Black screen and would not turn on. I contacted Punkt support and they told me they would not issue a refund for their phone that bricked itself after 5 months because I bought it from amazon. They offered to send me a new phone sometime around December (4 months from now). Thankfully this isn't my only phone or I would be screwed. Nonetheless, I will have to go get another phone and definitely not a Punkt phone.All in all, this phone is garbage, even for what it claims to be. I don't expect it to be a smartphone but it is one of the worst dumbphones on the market and definitely the worst dumbphone for the price.

The limitations described before are still there, but I have agreed to live with them.Had this phone for about a week and a half now. The punkt MP02 is really unmatched in its style and design. For those of us looking for a truly minimalist phone that in all possible ways discourages endless scrolling/ ""app jumping"", yet at the same time provides essential functions like high quality voice calling, minimal texting, and wifi tethering when needed, nothing on the market beats punkt\'s concept. It is an elegant concept with an equally elegant hardware. No news, no social media, no games, no icons - the only reason you will pull this phone out of your pocket is to either call someone, or answer a call. The speaker quality is also excellent.With that said, the phone\'s software is woefully lacking. Fundamental technologies that are standard to the modern world like MMS/group chat and WiFi calling are not supported. Although the Signal platform implemented via the pigeon app works, it is impossible to link an additional device to the punkt as it lacks a camera to scan the QR code. (I\'m okay with no camera, but I wish there was a work-around to link another device). The battery life is very poor - especially for a such a feature-less phone. The battery seems to last about 2 and 1/2 days for me on standby (with me not doing anything at all with the phone). The WiFi tethering eats up the battery at rate of about 40 % in 30 minutes. Even more annoying is the poor reception on T-Mobile\'s network. One would think such a pricey phone that is marketed as a high quality voice phone ""built with the 21st century in mind"" would have a powerful antenna and support every single frequency out there, but the phone barely has network signal in a urban-suburban setting. Network is non-existent when indoors. I can\'t imagine it being hard to implement/ improve these seemingly basic features, but the punkt team really bluffed with the software. I tried so hard to try and justify the price for this phone, but at the end of the day, it doesn\'t make the cut. When you are unable to make and receive phone calls at most times, that really defeats the purpose of any phone - especially that of the punkts. I considered keeping the phone, and hoped they do a major revamp of the software, but I am wary of that ever happening. This phone has been around in some from since 2015. That is plenty of time during which nothing was improved. I will sadly have to return this device before its return deadline expires. Hopefully, Punkt rethinks their strategy and give this beautiful phone the software it deserves.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Leo J.

Of course. I dare say, it\'s better than the ""haha"" I had hoped it would give me, and gave me the ""please be more than useable"" I really wanted.The TL;DR is IT WORKS. ITS FUN. ITS TINY. ITS AMAZING. BUY THIS PHONE, THE PRICE IS WORTH IT. Seriously. I\'m so extremely elated to own a tiny phone like this that can do most everything I expected from it.To start, the screen. It\'s tiny, yes, but it\'s also looks pretty good. Peel off the manufacturer\'s fuzzy screen protector, and you have a serviceable screen. At that size, you need a high enough resolution that gives you clarity, and this phone delivers. Also, the text all seem to be manipulated by a custom android OS made to give legibility and formatting to work on the small screen. Chrome and other apps were all sized and formatted in a way that everything was easy to read, no need to zoom.You might think typing is difficult on the screen, but my secret weapon for you is Gboard. Download the keyboard from the Play store, and turn on Glide. Boom, you can now swipe/Swype/glide with ease. I typed my typical book-long messages to my viewers in Discord with ease. Hangouts? No issues. Side note: there is a custom keyboard in it, it might have glide/Swype, but I didn\'t use it. Gboard is my jam, so I went with that.I downloaded quite a few apps for this phone, and some intensive games. They all ran acceptably, but a few stuttered. Honestly, if you want to game hardcore, you\'re looking at the wrong phone. Emulating with a Bluetooth controller, though? Chefs kiss, babay, it handles the classics of the 16 bit era quite well. Definitely a nice teeny pocket handheld. And, hey, Alto\'s Adventure ran beautifully.Quick tip: use Nova Launcher and give it a more traditional Android look, it\'ll make the phone feel more complete. It runs perfectly with a custom launcher.The typical features of a phone were all FINE on this. Great volume, strong vibrate, the Bluetooth worked wonderfully to make this an MP3 player, and so on. The cameras on the front and back are pretty low quality in low light, but they snapped acceptable pics. You\'ll be wanting a different device for higher quality photos, come on. Battery life is great. Full charge in an hour, idled on for three days without dying. I left it sitting at 75 percent, from me playing on it for about 45 minutes. It might not be an all day phone using it nonstop, but the faster charge is nice.Phone calls were great. If you don\'t want to hold a tiny phone, use Bluetooth. I used it, with zero issue, perfect call quality. Any bad areas in town were still bad areas with this phone, but that\'s to be expected.Oh, also, it came with all the goodies. A screen protector. Charging cable. Sim card slot puller. AND A CUTE LITTLE CASE.I use a Note 20 Ultra as my daily phone. I used this for 5 days straight, and will keep carrying it around, along with that behemoth. I\'m in love with it. It\'s ridiculous, you know this. But, it\'s actually serviceable, if you need a small alternative. Will it fit every situation? Maybe not. But it\'ll most likely fill yours, if you\'re here. The price is about right, in my humble opinion.I will be posting a video of my time with it elsewhere, keep an eye out for Havok Versus Everything, or find me just to chat. I will yell about how much I love this thing.If you have any more questions, ask in the question section and I will answer the best I can. There\'s too much to say, and a lot of intricacies to owning a phone I might not have thought of off the top of my head. I got ya, just ask.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MW', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'DOES NOT EORK ON CRICKET OR AT&T AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT IN ENGLISH', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The words on the phone screen are NOT in ENGLISH!!!!

I suoi principali punti di forza sono:- Design robusto con certificazione IP68/IP69K per resistenza ad acqua, polvere e urti- Ampia batteria da 13.200 mAh per un'autonomia di diversi giorni- Processore MediaTek Helio G99 octa-core- Fotocamera principale da 108MP- Display da 6,58 pollici FHD+- Sistema operativo Android 13Il dispositivo si distingue per la sua resistenza e l'enorme batteria, ideale per chi lavora all'aperto o in condizioni difficili. Le prestazioni sono nella media per questa fascia di prezzo.Le piccole criticità sono il peso e le dimensioni, ma è chiaro che se lo si vuole usare come faccio io per un lavoro dove acqua e polvere la fanno da padroni, diventa una condizione imprescindibile, oltre a un comparto fotografico non eccezionale nonostante i 108MP sulla carta, ma anche qui se volevo un camera phone avrei preso altro.,quindi non mi lamento.Nel complesso, è una buona scelta per chi, come me, cerca uno smartphone ultra resistente e con batteria quasi infinita, sacrificando però portabilità e alcune funzionalità avanzate.In conclusione in questa fascia di prezzo e per l'utilizzo che ne devo fare, va più che bene.Consegna sempre impeccabile con la Logistica di Amazon, veloce precisa e gratuita con Prime in meno di 24 ore.Grazie per l'attenzione.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'NiBo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on August 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Ich habe das Handy für meinen Mann gekauft.

One would need to either limit background data, and watch what applications they used or use a firewall app and only allow certain data in/out to keep usage levels low enough to make it last a whole month. I have done some experimenting (I have a Solis 5G hotspot which gives me 1G a month, and I can make it last if I do those things/mostly just use it to send/receive text). This card changes that, it gives you 4GB of data for 30 days, which in reality is not a huge amount, but I think if managed effectively, it could comfortably support the use of a single mobile user.

I first tried Visible (which uses the Verizon network), and almost everything worked fine, except that I couldn't download incoming MMS messages (group texts and picture messages). I contacted support and they tried some troubleshooting steps, but eventually gave up and said that they don't support this model of phone. Next I tried Mint (which uses the T-Mobile network), and now everything is working correctly. In summary, this phone does work on at least some carriers in the United States, but you'll probably be without help if anything goes wrong. I suspect that the 4G band list in the product description is incomplete, given that I got strong signals on both Verizon and T-Mobile.The biggest downside for me is that the GPS doesn't seem very precise, so this phone isn't very useful for turn-by-turn directions. Otherwise it would be five stars for me: it's a great set of features for the price.A few other pros and cons, in no particular order:+ I didn't expect the phone to come with a case and screen protector; this was a delightful surprise.+ The camera and speakers are both better than I expected given the price point.- The Google Play store crashes any time I use the search bar.

Von der Größe her ist es unglaublich klein und handlich - fast schon befremdlich, so ein kleines Gerät in den Händen zu halten. Trotz des winzigen Bildschirms mit nur 3 Zoll, kann man das Gerät relativ normal bedienen, inkl. Tippen auf der virtuellen Tastatur.Man muss sich bewusst sein, dass man hier weder eine sonderlich starke Leistung vom Prozessor, noch vom Betriebssystem (Android 9) erwarten kann. Es sind einige Apps wie Whatsapp, Youtube und Twitter bereits vorinstalliert, aber ansonsten keine lästige Bloatware. Die vorinstallierten Apps lassen sich auf Wunsch auch löschen. Google Apps sind alle vorhanden. Das scrollen durch das Menü würde ich von der Geschwindigkeit als ""normal"" bezeichnen. Moderne Smartphones können das definitiv flüssiger, aber das liegt auch an der höheren Bildwiederholungsrate der neuen Displays. Auch im Browser oder in Apps fühlt es sich nicht ganz schnell an, aber durchaus brauchbar. Startet man aber zum Beispiel ein Video, wird dieses ganz normal und flüßig abgespielt. Auch die Tonqualität ist OK, sofern man keine lauten Umgebungsgeräusche um sich hat.Der Akku ist wirklich stark und sollte locker 3-4 Tage (oder wahrscheinlich mehr - anfangs habe ich doch sehr viel mit dem Gerät herum probiert) halten. Einerseits ist er mit 2600 mAh großzügig bemessen, andererseits braucht der kleine Display und der schwache Prozessor weniger Energie.Empfangstechnisch und von der Sprachqualität her könnte ich mich nicht beschweren. Auch die Kamera macht halbwegs brauchbare Schnappschüsse bei hellen Lichtverhältnissen, auch wenn natürlich von den drei Linsen nur hinter einer wirklich ein funktionierender Sensor steckt.Das Gerät eignet sich also für jene, die mal ein bisschen digitalen Detox benötigen, aber dennoch im ""Notfall"" zugriff auf Smartphone-Apps benötigen. Der kleine Bildschirm und die etwas langsamer Bedienung trüben nach kurzer Zeit den sonst üblichen Suchtfaktor. Ansonsten ist dieses Smartphone bestimmt auch gut geeignet als Erst-Telefon für Grundschulkinder.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Guedon Melvin', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on August 25, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Rien à dire tout fonctionne\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mata Hari', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on June 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Natürlich ist das Phone für den typischen Smartphonenutzer ""zu klein"".

I'm continually pleased more and more as I use it. Look, I don't delve deep into specs or drool over asthetics - I just want a phone that does what it's supposed to do. But it sure does look nice all the same. Add a Poetic case and it will feel solid in your hand and it will sit without wobble from the cameras. It's fast. The screen looks great. Speakers are rather loud with volume up but of course you aren't likely to play music using only the speakers, you'll stream it to some Bluetooth speakers or use ear buds. Android 14 is slick and easy to use. As always, Motorola adds only a few gesture options and a few moto specialty assists but you don't need to use them - you will, though! No added bloat, almost pure Android. The cameras are far better than the moto cams of old. I have no complaints. Charges ridiculously fast. Battery lasts 2 days or more normal use, I haven't drained it fully to see exactly how long but I'm very happy with the battery life. The power button below the volume is weird at first but it's easy to get used to. You can power off using the button on the screen near the settings icon so you rarely need the physical button anyway. You can also change the very odd default setting for power off using the power key and volume button same time, which is awkward. Just check the settings and switch it to power off with just the power button. I love a big phone so I'm happy with the size. And here's something unexpected that I really appreciate - the screen is smudge resistant and does a great job of keeping prints off it. The phone looks nice all the time, no greasy fingerprints for the most part. When you do notice it needs a wipe, a soft cloth and literally 2 seconds to get it perfect again is all you need. Any marks come right off without smudging. The haptics give a great feel as you navigate. The price is excellent for the quality of this phone. Highly recommended.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'kyle olson', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing phone in 2024. Superb battery life. Beautiful screen. Impressive camera.

This phone has great flagship tier specs.Pros: The screen is beautiful at 6.6 inches. The OLED screen is bright, even in sunlight. My last phone struggled there. The 144hz display feels amazing in my hands.The carbon fiber backing of this phone feels very premium. It's soft and super durable. I feel bad putting a case on it! It needs to be shown off haha.  The aluminum sides feel nice.  I've never had a phone this waterproof and I'm afraid to test it haha.The 68w fast charging is amazing, I went from 10%-100% in around 30 minutes. That's mind blowing. The battery lasts over night, and throughout the next day. I top off before bed and don't worry about it again.The camera is remarkable. A huge step up from my previous phone. Anyone who says this camera isn't good, relies too much on ai processing. The only thing it's missing is telescopic view.Ready for Smart Connect is LIFE CHANGING. I'm able to use my phone while on my computer at work. It has made phone usage and communication so much better.  It has so many features I would need to make a video about it.The 5G is blazing fast on ATT prepaid.  You'd think it would cost extra to see speeds increase this much! Only had 4g before.It has great Bluetooth specs, supports aptX Adaptive Lossless. Usually that's reserved for the top flagships!  I use wired so I won't use it soon, but will be nice if I need it.Face unlock is so fast it usually beats my fingerprint!Cons:It's missing expandable storage, and a headphone jack.  I was holding out for a phone that had those two specs, but this phone's price and performance won me overIt gets a bit warm when using the phone.  It's never super concerning, but it's definitely a reminder for me to set my phone for down for a bit to cool off.Overall, hands down an amazing purchase for under $400. I would recommend to anyone looking for an android at $400 or less\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Erin A.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Motorola Think phone 2023 most reviews are for other phones in the same column 🤔', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024', 'Review Body': ""When searching for mid-range phones that perform well, have enhanced durability waterproofing and are not excessively pokey, the Motorola think from 2023 is a fantastic choice. When searching for phones for my son, I was prone to break phones or submers them, this phone grabbed my attention. The gorilla Glass Victus screen with military spec drop protection as well as ip68 waterproofing is reassuring. At under $400 price is fair. The phone is not overly bulky, it performs a snappy as any other, the screen is great. Basically this is a flagship phone spec from a few years ago without the $1,000 price tag. Of course it has the Motorola customizable features beyond plane Android, added secure folders and the ability to interact with Windows base computers, particularly the ThinkPad. But even if you're not using it for these purposes, it is a great performing phone that does all the things that should do. The camera is very good, talk quality is good, the stereo speaker sound/quality is good, perhaps a bit more peak volume would be suggested in future rendition but still adequate. The biggest frustration is when searching for phones like this, Amazon does not discern and reviews what phone is being reviewed. So when you look at the amount of stars this phone has, it is not at all clear that it reflects this phone, certainly the comments do not as therefore many different models. It seems to me that there should be a way for them at Amazon too straighten this out 🧐\nRead more""}]",,,,Volcanic Gray,,,,Slate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.25 x 0.33 x 2.93 inches,Water Resistant,,,,,,,2024-10-19

THE key feature I needed was solid connectivity.  My old phone tended to drop the data connection in some areas - these issues have been completely resolved with Nokia.  Battery life is great, also much better than the motorola - even after a day of heavy use there\'s still plenty of charge left.  I don\'t recall having less than 30%Also, since it is an unlocked phone, there\'s virtually no bloatware pre-installed.Camera is decent - I\'d say up to par with the Motorola Action One if not better.  I use it for videos of my classes as well as snapshots and it handles all lighting conditions well.The only reason I\'m giving it only 4 out of 5 stars is that Nokia elected to put the google assistant permanently on the main screen - I believe a change of launcher will be in order in the foreseeable future.One additional note;  I\'m using the phone on the T-mobile network.  No issues here.  Interesting fact T-mobile sells their branded/locked phone about cheaper than this one.  However, they will charge you an ""Upgrade Fee"" that is roughly the same amount as their lower price.  When I asked them what the service was that this fee supposedly covered, they could not provide a concise answer.Bottom line:  This unlocked version comes to the same price as the T-mobile branded/locked phone and you have less pre-installed ""Stuff"" on it - definitely recommend this one!Update:  lost the software connection to the front facing camera about nine months into using this phone. Thankfully still covered under warranty, but I got to remove all sensitive data and ship it to Nokia to fix.  Currently struggling to find a temporary replacement.

I compared this Nokia G400 5G camera in multiple lighting conditions to a Motorola G Stylus 5G (2021),  and the Nokia had a better picture in every case.  For a phone at this price it has a good camera.  I also compared the camera to a Pixel 7a (which cost more than double) and the Pixel 7a had a better picture in every case (as expected).

Je trouve ça super.⭐ Puissance : Avec une batterie externe au 3/4, mon iPhone 7 a été rechargé de 10 à 90 %. Cela présage d’un sacré bonus d’autonomie.⭐ Indication Intelligente : Les petites LED fournissent une visualisation claire du niveau de charge, permettant une gestion pratique de l\'alimentation.⭐ Polyvalence de chargement : La présence d\'une prise lightning et d\'un port USB-C rend le chargement de la batterie externe facile et flexible, quel que soit le chargeur sous la main.⭐ Petite touche esthétique : La batterie est assortie à la couleur de l’iPhone 12 mini bleu. C’est plus classe quand l’ensemble est posé sur le bureau.⚠️ Petit Souci : Le capuchon de la batterie pourrait être plus sécurisé pour éviter les pertes potentielles. Un petit cordon aurait pu être une bonne idée.En Bref, cette batterie externe promet d’être un compagnon idéal pour l\'iPhone de mon épouse, praticité sans perdre en style.PS : J\'espère que mon avis et les photos associées peuvent vous aider dans votre choix.

I found it hard to relax at times not knowing if there was an emergency going on back home. I spent too much time trying to look for cell service instead of relaxing. This year I’m planning a week long camping trip to Canada where I know cell service with be non-existent.  I was already having anxiety knowing I was going to be disconnected from loved ones for a whole week.Recently a friend of mine recently showed me the Zoleo device he planned on purchasing.  I started doing research on the Zoleo when I came across the Motorola Defy. The Motorola defy caught my attention as the device itself was cheaper and the subscription options were much more affordable compared to Zoleo and other similar devices.After receiving the Motorola Defy in the mail, I tested it as rigorously as I could for a week. It should be noted I live in rural northern Wisconsin where cell service is often spotty or non-existent. I took the device deep into the National Forest near where I live and where cell phone service is non-existent. I never once lost satellite connection and I was able to message my wife without any issues. I also took the device with me during a half day kayak trip through the forest where there is no cell service. I again never lost satellite connection no matter what direction I was facing. Messaging went through just as fast as using cell towers. I’ve yet not found a place where I wasn’t able to stay connected to a satellite unless I was inside or standing next to a tall building.This is only my experience in northern Wisconsin and I can’t speak for anyone else. I can’t wait to test it in Canada. I have faith it’ll work just as good there based on my experience thus far.Update… I just got back from my week long fishing trip to Canada. I was in Ontario about an hour away from any type of cell service. The Motorola defy worked well, however; there were a few cons.It is noted during my trip I had the 80 messages a month plan; at least that’s what I thought. As I was messaging my wife, I noticed my data allowance percentage was decreasing rapidly after each message. I later realized the plan says “ Up to 80 messages a month”. I read on the Bullitt website any messages longer than 35 characters will use more data, hence fewer messages allowed for the month. Bullitt states 35 characters is the average text length, which I find hard to believe. I sent and received about 28 messages, some including my location. I ended up with 21 percent remaining by the end of the trip. I probably would have gotten close to 35 messages before running out of data.It is also noted, Bullit limits the number of characters you can send in one message. This equals to about four to five lines of typing. Any messages longer, the message won’t send. Same went for my wife when she tried messaging me from home using the Bullitt app. This was frustrating because I wanted to tell my wife how my day went. I had to fit a lot of information in one small message, unless I broke it down into several messages which would ultimately end up using all my data. My friend had the Zoleo device with him, and he said he is allowed up to 900 characters per message. Also with the Zoleo, they go by actual messages sent and received instead of data, which I thought was simpler.Secondly, as I was running out of data, we drove into town where I had cell service. I was trying to upgrade my plan to the freedom plan so I had more messages without a year long contract. Unfortunately it would only allow me to upgrade to the 300 message a month with a 12 month contract. If I read the plans right, you can only switch to the freedom plan if your monthly data allowance ran out, which mine had not.I’m still giving this device five stars. This is based on affordability along with the device sending and receiving messages flawlessly. I just wish you could send longer messages along with the data plans going by true message counts and not by data used based on length of messages. I hope this helps.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Brian B', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'DO NOT RELY ON THIS FOR GETTING HELP', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023', 'Review Body': ""EDIT: Spent the day yesterday hiking the Boone Fork to Calloway Peak trail in the Grandfather Mountain State Park.  This can be a very challenging trail w/ a 2200' change in elevation with multiple actual ladders constructed to facilitate climbs.  Even at the very top, this unit could NOT make a connection to a satellite.  As this is a 4.5 hour hike round trip, if someone were to be injured toward the top, it would be many hours before someone else in the party (assuming you're not alone) could hike back down, drive for help, and return with assistance. This along with other hours spent hiking very popular areas tells me this is NOT the device you want to rely on for help.Original review:This is a totally useless device for a HUGE part of the US. Hiking miles on the Mountain to Sea Trail, the vast majority of the time there is NO satellite service. They chose to use only satellites visible facing south but of course the MST runs east-west (or west-east depending on which way you start). Despite that, apparently there are going to be huge swaths of other parts of the country where you cannot get a clear south face view to reach a satellite and if you need emergency services having to rely on only this satellite system is likely going to mean you will not be able to call for service. I cannot understand how their coverage maps are not considered fraud by the FTC. It appears they just took a map of the US and coloured it in.  Do they assume no one will ever figure out the device doesn't work?  The MST is shown as fully covered and yet there’s zero signal over a great majority of it. I managed to get one message out as a test and didn’t move more than 10 feet and couldn’t get the second message out and yet according to the compass app on my iPhone I had a clear view of the direction that their app said the satellites were located in. Save your money, this device isn’t likely to save you in far too many places.Add to all of this, their support is poor at best. There are so many other shortcomings for this product and its associated app, I cannot imagine why anyone would recommend this.Anyway, device returned.  I'd give it 0 stars if Amazon allowed me to.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'majellin', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""As long as you know what you're buying this communicator is awesome!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I took a big gamble on buying this because of all the negative reviews and I am glad I did. It works perfect. It sends and receives messages via satellite consistently within 13-14 seconds and generally takes less than 30 seconds to lock on to a signal if it is going to get one at all. If you don\'t have a signal fairly quickly it is because you don\'t have a good ""view"" of the satellite. I put that in quotes because I am able to send and receive messages inside my house (and no it\'s not sending via cellular or wi-fi). I have had trouble if a window you are trying to transmit through has any kind of metallic tint, etc. The device was very easy to set up, connects well to my phone, maintains a connection, and battery life has been great. You do not get a dedicated phone number for people to reach you and in my opinion that is a good thing so you don\'t end up paying for spam text messages. You can send messages to any phone number whether they have the app or not but if they want to respond they will need to download the app. I bought this unit simply as a backup in event of a hurricane or I am out in an area without cell signals. The price of the unit is a cheap as it gets and the service itself (using it in the limited way I am) is far cheaper than other satellite communicators ($60/yr, no tax, no setup fee, no contract other than you prepay for the year).  The original company had gone bankrupt which is actually pretty common in this area of tech but the firm running it now is working out fine. I test it once or twice a month and it has never failed. Maybe some people have gotten faulty devices and that sucks but I have been extremely impressed.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dana', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on December 24, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Great price\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'eric hendriks', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 1, 2024', 'Review Body': ""A month and two phones and still can't get it set up.

We attached the lanyard and she keeps this phone with her wherever she goes in the house or yard just in case she falls or has an emergency.

It can play mp3s and podcasts. I use it with bluetooth headphones while going on walks and runs and so far it has been great.Positives:- Small enough to fit in a sleeve with my water bottle and not feel the additional weight- Bluetooth works well enough, so I don\'t have to use wired headphones while running- Google podcasts works flawlessly on itNegatives:- CPU is weak, so the phone is really slow (doesn\'t matter too much after setting everything up though)- Phone is using very old tech, so I doubt any carrier will support it (doesn\'t matter for my use case)- The small screen and old OS means a lot of apps won\'t work (Android 6.0 with no updates available)- The battery is small due to the size and drains fairly quickly even when not in use- Bluetooth connection is weak, so the phone has to stay closeEven with all the negatives, I don\'t regret this purchase. I charge it before I go out and it can easily play music for 3 or 4 hours.

Establishing the phone was a relatively simple process. I just completed the process of inserting the SIM card, and it immediately connected to our wifi network. My youngster has no trouble navigating the UI since it is straightforward and basic. He likes the fact that he can access applications that are suitable for children, play games, and even snap some images using the camera that is integrated into the device. Moreover, this small phone has shown that it is incredibly long-lasting. The fact that it has been dropped a few times, which is to be expected for a child eight years old, has not caused any harm to it. It seems that the plastic case is quite resistant to impact.

It performs well enough for a basic phone, but it's unfortunately let down by its misleading advertising.For starters, the advertisement incorrectly claims that the phone possesses 128 GB of storage. However, upon receipt and inspection of the actual product, it's clear that this is not the case. Similarly, the ad and box claim that the phone has a metal frame, but in reality, it's made of plastic.Despite these misleading aspects, the phone itself is fairly reliable, especially considering its lower-end positioning. The call functionality and texting work splendidly, and the overall responsiveness of the device is pretty satisfactory.The screen, while visible and functional, leaves room for improvement. The viewing angles are limited, which can sometimes hinder the user experience. However, given the phone's price point, this is an understandable compromise.The phone's cameras are passable for basic needs, and you could definitely manage with them. The email functionality is efficient, the keyboard user-friendly, and the touch responsiveness is satisfactory.In conclusion, this phone is a decent choice for those who need a basic, cost-effective device. However, it's crucial for potential buyers to be aware that the advertising claims are not entirely truthful, specifically regarding the storage capacity and the frame material.With more accurate advertising, this phone could have easily earned a solid four stars.

It took several minutes to make the connection and then the phones would ring. So using this in an emergency is useless. I canceled the Speedtalk plan I had chosen after trying the phone the next day and it not connecting at all again. I eventually went to T-mobile and got a sim to replace the one from my wife's lost phone (which is why I wanted to try this cheap phone in the first place) and the phone worked like it should, connecting quickly and getting good signal strength. So now she has a decent phone that she can use when she is out and I won't worry about her being able to call quickly and not have to wait for the Speedtalk sim to find a network to connect to and then eventually connecting with a phone.

The Moto features we've all come to know and love are all here, plus a few nice dditions including Moto Secure, a security app which gives an overview of the security features on the phone and how to best make use of them, phishing and malware protection and a handy pin shield, SIM card lock and personal folder, these features would usually be found on much higher priced devices.It has a big screen, 6.5 inches with dual stereo speakers and spacial sound, all powered by Dolby Atmos for mobile for that extra dimention when watching your favourite movies or listening to music or podcasts.For the first time, a Motorola with an under screen fingerprint sensor.  Located just above the USB port and doubling as your home button, this is a nice touch, it's easy to find and unlocks your device quickly as well as allowing you to authenticate purchases using Google Pay and the Google Play store and for any other apps that require biometric authentication.I love the leather feel on the back, which gives it that premium feel without the premium price tag.  I went for the Marsh Mellow Blue colour, but the red one is also very fetching and the clear case that comes with it is a clear pastic, so nice to show off without the back getting finger marked or scratched.Just beware the plug that comes with this though, mine came with an EU plug in the box and is meant for retail in mainland Europe, however Motorola assure me that regardless, software updates will come through at the same time as if I'd bought it in the UK.  One nice touch is that mine also came with a car charger, so if you're planning to hit the road, you'll be ready for that too.All in all very happy apart from the EU plug thing, though genuine Motorola chargers are available on Amazon, my recommended option is the 50W charger with dual port USB C and USB A, that way you can charge an extra accessory like headphones from the same socket.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'smarttvminix', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Singapore on February 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Overall robust performance.. volte supported for starhub network.

L’ultimo telefono praticamente lo ha rotto perché gli si è seduto sopra. A questo punto dopo una accurata ricerca ho scelto questo oukitel. Le caratteristiche mi hanno allettato così l’ho acquistato. Effettivamente tutto corrisponde nei minimi dettagli alla descrizione. E’ veramente robusto con un grande display da 6.52 pollici. E’ fatto molto bene . E’ robusto nei punti giusti come gli angoli e la scocca dietro. Prima di darglielo l’ho testato io e posso dire che ne è valsa la pena. Ha tutte le funzioni di sblocco come il faceId , l’impronta digitale e laterale. Monta l’ultimo aggiornamento di Android che sarebbe il 14 ha il processore octa-core e soprattutto una batteria a dir poco ottima  da 10600mAh. Anche se mio papà ha una certa età gli piace navigare sui social per cui pretende anche una certa fluidità nel dispositivo per cui l’ho provato e non c’è niente da dire. Le applicazioni si aprono e si chiudono in maniera veloce e i video non hanno nessun rallentamento. Ho provato anche a vedere una partita e tutto è andato a buon fine. Ha una memoria da 16Gb di RAM più una da 128 di ROM espandibili fino ad 1Tb. Una buona fotocamera sia anteriore che posteriore. La cosa più importante è che il telefono resiste all’acqua e questa è un opzione fondamentale perché ripeto essendo sbadato non si sa mai dove lascia il telefono. In conclusione posso dire che questo telefono è ottimo la qualità prezzo e’ fantastica perché con tutte queste caratteristiche e’ difficile trovare un telefono con questi prezzi.

Unfortunately, I never bought a Pixel because Google chose, at first, to compete with the expensive flagship phones that cost $800 or more being put out by Apple and Samsung every year. That has since changed, and I\'m a welcome convert back to the Google fold.My last phone was a Moto Z Play, which I purchased for $400 about three and a half years ago. I loved the battery life, but the bluetooth died almost entirely when the phone was two years old, and the camera was never great. By the time I had had it for three years, I couldn\'t run more than two or three apps without experiencing issues with crashing. Likewise, if I opened more than 50 or so tabs in the web browser, it would typically crash. It\'s a relief to no longer have those issues.COST: I purchased this phone when it was $320, so I already saved $80 over my last phone purchase. This phone does everything you need and looks sharp. It doesn\'t have 5G, but the amount of features you get for less than $400 more than justifies the price.CAMERA: Google has really outdone itself with the Pixel 3a\'s. The camera is fantastic; I no longer need to bring a dedicated digital camera when I\'m traveling or attending major celebrations like graduations that need a good camera. It\'s performance in low-light conditions is fantastic and really something to write home about. Sure, my  brother\'s iPhone 11 Pro has a better camera, but he paid over $1000 for it, so that\'s not a fair comparison. I\'d say that the Pixel 3A\'s camera and camera software is every bit as good as my wife\'s Galaxy 10, if not better.BATTERY LIFE: A full charge doesn\'t last the 2-3 days that my old Moto Z Play did, but the rapid charging feature makes it not matter as much. In my daily commute of 20-30 minutes to work, I can add about 30-40% to my battery, which means I never have to worry about my phone going dead, even if I forget to charge it at night. A full charge tends to last a little over a day with heavy use. For the record, nearly every day I browse the internet for hours, play Sudoku, listen to Spotify, and post and browse on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.HARDWARE: It\'s not a flagship phone, so it\'s not going to hold up to intensive use. That said, nothing I\'ve thrown at it so far as crashed it. Like I said, I\'m a heavy phone user. I don\'t have to close my apps before switching to another one like I did with my last phone to avoid crashes. I also have experienced hangs like I did with my last phone either. This really does everything you need it to do. I don\'t think that a normal to heavy phone user needs much more power than this unless they\'re gaming or photo editing on their phone or something. The bluetooth works a lot better than my old phones did. I have an aging 2013 Prius that does not like to play nice with bluetooth in a lot of my devices. I get in the car, and the phone automatically hooks to the bluetooth and brings up my last Spotify podcast without me fussing with it past the initial setup. I forgot how nice it was when things just worked, you know?LOOK & FEEL: I really like that it\'s lighter than my last phone even though the screen and the screen\'s resolution is much larger. It doesn\'t  have a trendy notch, but I don\'t really care. The fingerprint is located in a nice place in the back that feels very intuitive. There is a feature that lets you squeeze the phone to bring up Google Assistant that I could see some people enjoying, but I never use it because my hands are too small to put enough pressure on the phone to bring it up. Some people may dock a point or two for this, if it\'s important to you. I don\'t because I can just shout ""hey google"" at the phone to the same effect, and perhaps the feature works fine if you don\'t have tiny baby hands like me and buy a phone that\'s over 6 inches. The phone itself is mostly metal and glass and doesn\'t feel cheap. I don\'t think it looks like you spent less than $400 on it at all. Most importantly, it still has an aux port. Not all of us want the hassle of charging and keeping track of bluetooth earbuds that can cost more than your phone and don\'t sound any better than a $10 wired headset you can get at the pharmacy. The screen is absolutely huge and the resolution makes everything tiny. I don\'t have bad eyes and I\'m not an old maid, but I had to set the text size to ""large"" otherwise every website looks like those old Myspace profiles people made back in 2002 with size-6 font. It\'s very comfortable to read on; I don\'t feel like someone would need a dedicated tablet with a phone with a screen this big.SOFTWARE & OS/UI: If you\'re getting an Android OS, you\'ve probably fine with the OS. That said, Google\'s UI is so much better than everyone else\'s (I\'ve used UIs by Asus, Samsung, and Motorola in other phones). The home screen is easier to customize, the app launcher makes sense, and the app switcher is intuitive and quick. Since it\'s Google, you\'ll have the newest Android OS\'s at launch and support for longer than other manufacturers. That was one thing I missed dearly about my old Nexus, and I\'m glad Google is finally back in the sub-$500 market again so I can take advantage of it. I think my favorite feature about the UI is that I can turn on ""dark mode"" 24/7 so that I never have white bars or menus anywhere, just nice black ones. It\'s really saved my eyes. I also like that the volume and brightness on the phone has a very wide range of levels, much moreso than any other phone I\'ve had before, which always had ""silent,"" ""soft-ish"" and ""extremely loud"" with little in between. I can turn down the volume to almost-silent and the brightness to actually quite dark without installing third party apps. Also, there\'s no bloatware on the phone when you purchase it. That\'s really nice.All in all, it\'s a very solid phone and I\'m honestly thrilled with how nice the screen and camera is at this price-point. Everything else I\'ve looked at with comparable specs and features is at least $100 more. I\'ve been using mine for the past couple of weeks, and every day I like it more. Full five stars from me.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'C. Okamuro', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'I have a full Pixel 3 XL for work, and was excited for the 3a XL hit the market.  Highly Recommended', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2019', 'Review Body': 'After several years of growing tired of my Samsung Galaxy work phones getting slower and more bloated with the Samsung UI, I was convinced by coworkers to go to a Pixel.  I got the Pixel 3 XL and instantly loved it.  Seconds, rather than minutes, to boot.  A fast UI experience.  Frequent and comprehensive OS updates that aren\'t lagging months behind the Android updates.  A fantastic camera.  What\'s not to love?Even though I refer to my Pixel 3 XL as my work phone, the truth is that I haven\'t had a personal phone in over a decade... who wants to carry two phones?  Then again, there is something to be said about having a healthy work/life balance.  With that in mind, I was curious when I heard about the 3a coming to the market... as much as I love the 3 XL, I can\'t say that I was super excited to spend $900 on a phone.  When the 3a XL dropped below $300 (after the deal that gave you a $100 GC), it seemed like a no brainer.As someone that has both a 3XL and a 3a XL, here\'s what I can tell you:SCREENUnlike the 3 XL, the 3a XL has no screen ""notch"".  Where there are some parts of the UI that take advantage of the notch, there are just as many applications that leave an annoying color (non-black) artifact in the notch area when watching landscape full-screen video - it\'s SUPER annoying.  The 3a XL\'s screen is slightly smaller than the 3 XL, and while it\'s also a little lower resolution, the density (as a result of the smaller diagonal measurement) doesn\'t drop that much.  In general usage I don\'t notice any difference.  The 3a\'s screen is OLED, but it appears to be a quality tier below the 3 XL\'s... you can see it if they are side-by-side, but you wouldn\'t notice it if you were going from memory.CAMERAPixel phones are renown for their camera performance.  While the raw specs tend to be behind other flagship phones\' optics and CCDs, the actual picture quality tends to be at or near the top of the heap.  The Pixel 3a XL is no different, as the rear camera is the same as the one on the 3 XL.  The front camera (which I really don\'t care as much about) goes with a single, rather than a dual, camera setup.  It\'s not the same as either front-facing camera on the Pixel 3 XL, but the software (which is largely responsible for the picture quality), is the same.  Both cameras appear to be excellent.FORM FACTORThe Pixel 3a XL is slightly larger than the Pixel 3 XL.  Some of it may be due to the notch-less screen causing the speaker and camera to be mounted above the screen.  Some may be due to the larger capacity battery.  Perhaps it\'s also influenced by the case material on the back being made of plastic, rather than glass.  Regardless, the phone is about 10% lighter, which is enough to be noticable.  An omission that I don\'t love is that the 3a XL does not support wireless chaging... it\'s not the end of the world, but it is missed.PERFORMANCEThe 3a XL does have a significantly slower CPU than the 3 XL.  The layout of both processors is to have 4 high speed cores, and 4 slower cores.  The general idea is that the system workloads can be managed by the OS\'es thread scheduler, and be placed on to the lowest power consuming core that is still adequate for the job.  Both phones are fine with multitasking.  I didn\'t actually notice any performance difference is the UI or in application speeds, but I also am not a mobile gamer... I would expect for the difference to be most obvious there (assuming there is one).  I was a little surprised when the 3 XL came out with 4GB of RAM (since I didn\'t know if that would be enough), but that worked out well.  The 3a XL has the same 4GB of RAM and therefore has similar performance.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES NOT ALEADY MENTIONEDOddly, the Pixel 3a XL has a headphone jack.  That\'s noteworthy because the 3 XL does NOT have a headphone jack.  I know there are some ""purists"" that are anti-bluetooth, but I\'d say that a phone is not an audiophile platform anyway.  Even if you have awesome $1500 headphones, I can still tell you that the DAC in your sub-170 gram phone is junk (comparatively).  One of the really nice features of the Pixel 3 XL is that it\'s waterproof... the 3a XL is not.  It\'s not a dealbreaker for me, but I can see where this would affect some peoples\' choices.In conclusion, I thought the deal I got on Amazon when I bought my 3a XL was so good that I bought the phone without even knowing if I\'d get a service plan for it.  Now that the 3a XL is at its ""normal"" price I still think it\'s an incredible deal, and I really question anyone who would buy a different phone at this device\'s price point.  Highly Recommended.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tracy Jones', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on July 18, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I switched from Samsung Galaxy to the Google Pixel because I wanted a better camera, and I definitely got better quality photos though it seems I don't have as many options for editing the photos on the Pixel, like adding stickers, etc. Reading the reviews, the notch was a big deal to some people but I don't notice it at all. I found it awkward to take screenshots - how do you hold the power and volume buttons at the same time when they're on the same side of the phone? On the Samsung they were on opposite sides so much easier. I accidentally discovered that I can just swipe up and get a screenshot button to press. I didn't find that tip in any of the help sites. Adding the emoji icon to the phone keyboard shortcuts was something else I figured out by accident. You'd think it would be there already. I like the call screening feature! It's easy and works great. I find the battery doesn't last as long as I would like, but I guess that's to be expected from a new Pixel 3 XL that I bought more than three years after it was released in 2018. It does charge very fast and it was super easy to transfer apps from my Samsung using the cord that came in the box. I thought the larger size might be a problem being a petite person, but it fits my hand just fine. For using basic apps and taking photos and videos, I would recommend buying this phone. It was 1/5 of the original price so definitely worth it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Angelo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on November 8, 2021', 'Review Body': 'I went through a lot of hoops to get this phone at a satisfactory quality for the price I wanted, and it took over a month of returns and talking with customer service representatives, but it was totally worth it in the end.

Yesterday I went to bed with the phone at 37% battery after being unplugged for 17 hours and had over 5 hours of screen on time (still had another 8 hours in the tank according to the phone). My only complaint is with the Pixel launcher which forces you into having the Google search bar and what's happening widget in your homescreen all the time. Can't be removed....

No se dejen engañar por el hecho de que su competencia tiene 3, 4 o hasta 5 lentes para fotos, o que si tiene 64 megapixeles etc. Honestamente esos son trucos de mercadotecnia, y este Pixel 3a XL lo demuestra con un único sensor, pues toma fotos que incluso supera celulares que valen hasta el doble, se nota que Google optimizó muy bien el software de la cámara para que tome fotos a la altura del Pixel 3XL que es su hermano mayor a pesar de que este último cuesta hasta $150 dlls más. El único punto ""débil"" que le veo al celular es su diseño, que a muchos no les gusta porque en las tendencias actuales los celulares poseen pantalla completa, y los marcos superior e inferior son algo vistosos, pero al menos a mi parecer hace al celular más cómodo de usar ya que evitas tocar la pantalla accidentalmente mientras juegas o ves videos, pero eso es completamente personal. En cuanto a la pantalla, es de 6 pulgadas OLED y también es de muy buena calidad, (full hd+) para el precio, tiene sonido estéreo que se escucha fuerte, pero no recomiendo subir todo el volumen ya que se saturan las bocinas (aunque es normal, pasa incluso en celulares más caros) basta con bajarle 2 puntos al volumen e incluso así se escucha fuerte, cuenta con jack 3.5mm para audífonos, la carga rápida es de 18 W y entrada usb-c, posee lector de huellas digitales en la parte trasera. La batería dura bastante y les anexo mis estadísticas de uso para tengan una perspectiva de la duración (Mi record fue sacarle 7 horas de pantalla con brillo al 75%) y en el caso de Call Of Duty Mobile funciona con los gráficos en alto y nunca se me ha atorado o cerrado inesperadamente en el uso cotidiano, sólo una vez me pasó pero porque intencionalmente abrí como 20 aplicaciones y otros juegos porque estaba cambiando a cada rato entre los mismos para poner a prueba la potencia del celular. Un punto fuerte que para mi en lo personal es muy importante es que tienes 3 años de actualizaciones tanto del sistema operativo como en parches de seguridad, y como plus el celular cuenta con el chip titan de Google, el cual se encarga de integrar bien la seguridad del software y hardware. Por lo que en cuanto a sus datos personales pueden estar tranquilos. El sistema operativo está muy bien pulido y funciona muy bien, ya que Google tiene control total tanto del sistema operativo como del hardware, y el celular funciona bajo al idea de como Google visualiza que debería funcionar android en los dispositivos con este sistema operativo.

I used it for a day or two and it seems based on my usage (internet browsing, checking messages, light use of Youtube, etc), the battery drains by 15% in a day and almost doesn\'t drain at all when I am not using it. I can go for a while without charging, which is what I want out of a smartphone.* Comes installed with Android 14. A lot of midrange phones tend to be one generation behind in OSes and not all of them get updates to the current OS, so i was pleasantly surprised to see this phone come with the latest Android OS. It still needed an update or two, but that was mostly for the latest security patches.* Decently sized and good build quality. It\'s a little bigger than the average smartphone, but it\'s thin enough to fit in my pockets and it\'s not too heavy. The larger screen size makes it easier to read things. The build of the phone itself does feel rugged as it claims to be. The back has a diamond pattern, making it easy to hold and won\'t retain smudgy fingerprints.* Camera is pretty good. I took a few pics and they\'re pretty decent for what the phone boasts. It also has a macro option for super up close photos and night vision mode to take pics at night. They\'re ok, but I don\'t really use them since I don\'t need them.THE BAD:* No headphone jack. While I am not personally bothered by it, I know a lot of people will swear by a headphone jack and this can be a dealbreaker. There are USB to headphone jack adapters out there at least.* No SD card slot. You\'re stuck with the phone\'s 256GB of internal storage. If you use a lot of apps, take lots of pics, or record lots of videos, you might want to find another phone that lets you expand your storage.* Screen near impossible to see under sunlight. If it\'s a bright sunny day outside, it\'s hard to see the screen even if it\'s set to max brightness.THE MEH:* Almost useless custom/smart key. The phone has a red button the left that the manual dubs as a ""smart key"". It\'s basically a custom button that you can assign any gesture or action towards, but by default, the OS doesn\'t have an option to let you customize it. There are apps out there that can let you assign a command or the like for the button.* Fixed grid size. By default, the grid size on the screen is 4x5 and it cannot be adjusted unless you use an app that lets you customize your home screen, such as Nova Launcher.* The default clock. It\'s set to a 24 hour format, but it can be changed to 12 hours. The date format it shows is DD/MM/YYYY and it can\'t be changed unless you want to use a different clock app.* Bleh speakers. They\'re at the bottom of the phone and they don\'t sound too impressive, almost tinny-like.* Fingerprint sensor is on the power button, making it a bit finicky to activate. Would have preferred to have it on the back of the phone instead.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alton Gurney', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Works with Metro by T-Mobile!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I ordered this and then I read on here thatsomebody said it doesn't work with Metro by T-Mobile well I couldn't cancel it so it came anyway and tried it and it worked perfectly this is a fast phone on the best plan with T-Mobile\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Edward Hutchison', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Poor signal for USA T-Mobile', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Really liked the phone but I use two sims, one AT&T and T-Mobile, AT&T works great but T-Mobile has poor signal compared to other phones\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ben clarke', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Libre 3 works fine', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Intuitive like most androids, good reception with T-Mobile.

But, too many times it is not using this SIM card for calling and for the internet data.Sometimes I turn on “Airplane mode,” and then turn it back off. Sometimes it fixed it. Other times I had to “Restart” the cell phone to get the data internet working. But the last time, this Sunday morning, October 13, the OUKITEL WP35 would not work on the SIM and data. I even took the Sim out and put it back in again.  I tried everything, but it would not work at all.At first I thought that my SIM could be bad. So I took that SIM out of that OUKITEL WP35 and put it in my three year old DOOGEE S96 Pro Rugged Smartphone. Then that SIM begin worked perfectly just as it was before. That is when I decided to send both of the OUKITEL WP35 Rugged Smartphones back to Amazon.So I will have to get another DOOGEE Rugged Smartphone.

This unit offers double the built in memory than the US versions, but is NOT compatible with all carriers, check to make sure this specific VERSION works with your carrier, not just ""Samsung A54"", since Samsung offers two versions of the A54.

The fingerprint sensor can store three fingerprints, it would be nice to have four so I can register both index and thumb on both hands.the camera is good, but like many Samsung phones, it seems it\'s over exposed.  It took good pictures at night, but not professional camera quality.  Overall, I would say it is a good camera with good color pickup, but I wouldn\'t use it for any professional I included some pics from our trip to Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge Tn. in various lighting to see what it would look like in an unskilled hand.  Overall, I am pleased with the camera.Battery wise, it lasted the whole day  + evening with full use.  GPS signal bounced around the mountains and couldn\'t get an accurate gps at all times.  Overall, my wife\'s I-phone got slightly better cell reception in troubled areas, but they were close.  All wi-fi connections came in clear and fast in the dead zones.  Size wise, it was able to fit well in a standard short\'s pocket nicely.  The phone is slightly heavier than the other entry level phones I\'ve owned, which seems to be better for gripping.Overall, I would say it was a great purchase.  cheaper than getting it through my provider, and double the built in storage than what they can provide.  A good step up from entry level, but not awe inspiring like the flagship phones.  It\'s just a good solid phone.**Added update:  Everything is the same, but found out why the signal was bounced around so much.  This phone does work with MetroPCS and at 5g, but this particular version only supports the high 5g frequency, but not the lower frequency.  Lower frequencies have a longer range, but  less data speeds.  So in the areas where you do not get a good 5g signal, you can usually get a good low frequency signal (4g?).  But this phone and metro PCS, it\'s has to rely only on the 5g.  Where I live, this is not much of an  issue, so check your service provider to make sure  this phone has both a 5g and an extended range signal that works with your carrier if you live  on the fringe of their service (which is quite huge in the US)  -- Even with this knowlege, it was a perfect purchase for me.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stanley V', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good Value.

The fact they call this ""Unlocked Worldwide"" is a total lie, and I don\'t even know how they get away with putting that in the title. Aside from all that the phone itself is nice, display looks good, camera is nice, and the speakers are pretty solid. However, none of that even matters if this phone doesn\'t support my carrier. Might I also mention the reason I bought this phone was because my current phone, an S21 Ultra, broke the other day for seemingly no reason. I bought the S21 here on Amazon, I got it refurbished from another 3rd party seller. Take this as a lesson, do NOT buy a phone unless it\'s coming DIRECTLY from Samsung or Apple. Also, if you really want a new phone, it\'s also a good idea to go and buy one in person rather then online.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sebastián Dodera Padrón', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Typical Samsung mobile phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024', 'Review Body': ""One of the reasons I purchased this mobile phone model was the large storage capacity of the phone (256 Gb) and that it works with 5G. Do not expect this phone to be something unusual or better than other Samsung' previous models. It just performs as good as many Samsung phones that I had during the years. It is reliable, has a decent screen, camera works great and provides the same kind of satisfaction with the remaining apps or software installed in it that other old versions did, it is a pity that this one does not come with a radio app from factory. Don't take the description in the page as 100% accurate, the phone doesn't include a charger as it is advertised and also it doesn't have a 3.5mm jack to plug most wired earphones which makes the use of an adapter mandatory. In conclusion this is a typical Samsung mobile phone that is reliable and easy to use as it predecessors. It is unlocked for the rest of the world, in the USA mine didn't work with Verizon and had to use Mint mobile.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tino', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es muy buen equipo, la pantalla es genial, la batería, el almacenamiento, el procesador, la fotografía.Es un teléfono que sí duda vale la pena\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Armando LG', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on June 29, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Después de una ardua búsqueda para encontrar el mejor celular con cámara este Samsung figura por debajo de los Google Pixel pro y de los iPhone  13 pro en adelante pero cuestan mucho más.Este toma excelentes fotos y videos, es muy rápido, funcional, práctico y el audio estéreo y muy nítido.Estoy muy contento con mi compra.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alfonso S.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on August 11, 2024', 'Review Body': 'funda SAMSUNG Galaxy A54 quedo muy bien de tamaño\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Enrique', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 24, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Entre tantas marcas de gama media alta, creo que este celular es de lo mejor.

Arrived withAndroid 13 installed. Phone was well packed and came in a plain box with a nice 5Volt 2Amp (9Volt 1.87Amp) charger, USB C charging cable, and SIM Tray removal tool. The box was labeled NEW. The model I received is SM-G986U1. It is NEW, Pristine, Looks and Performs Flawlessly. The phone is Fully Unlocked for all US carriers GSM and CDMA. I put my SIM card and SD card in the dual SIM tray, powered up and in a short while I was up and running. I used the included Smart Switch app to transfer everything from my old Samsung phone. The phone is fast, color and graphics are great. WiFi and Bluetooth connect easily and work flawlessly. Phone connects quickly to Tracfone/Verizon mobile network and switches smoothly between LTE and 5G as I travel along. My Cell service is Tracfone through Verizon. The S20+ supports most of the LTE bands and 5G bands used by Verizon. This is important especially if you live or travel in a weak signal area with Verizon or other CDMA carrier. I don’t know about GSM carriers.  I  first ordered the S20 FE, which, I found out, does not support the mmWave bands needed for the fastest 5G Verizon service or reliably connect to Verizon in my weak signal home location. As a result I couldn’t get connected unless I walked outside my house into my driveway. Someone living in a strong signal area would not notice unless they travel into a weak signal area. This seems to be a problem with the design of the S20 FE and not the fault of the Renewer or Amazon. I wasn't willing to wait and try a replacement S20 Fe 5G so, unfortunately I had to send the S20 FE 5G back, I ordered the S20+ 5G instead. I'm very happy with my decision and with my S20+ 5G which supports 5G mmWave and reliably connects to Verizon in my weak signal area.I can’t say enough good about Stalion Requip. All Renewers are not created equal. Stalion Requip includes a printout of all the internal specs and test results so you know what you're getting.

Shipped fast and arrived early.  Thank you.This phone is great.  The screen is clear, bright and very dim when that's required too.  The internals are snappy and responsive, audio is loud and crystal clear.  Overall it feels like a solid pocket computer.The only negative I have found is the fingerprint reader.  Since it's on the front, under the screen, only thumbprints make sense, and it's sloooow!  Its also unusable if my hands are not completely clean and dry.  I'm always doing filthy things working with my hands, so usually I just swipe and unlock with a pattern.  Coming from years of using LG phones, Samsung could take some pointers on the fingerprint scanner function and location.  It makes me sad that LG is not making pocket computers anymore.  Samsung is good, LG was better overall I think.  Still, it's a good machine for good value.Edit:  the fingerprint reader has stopped functioning completely.  Its is fully useless except as a blingy gimmick.  If you need a phone that will unlock via fingerprint, don't buy this.UPDATE: apparently Samsung is junk.  Dropped last month and even inside full armor, the back glass cracked.  Who builds a phone using glass on the back?  Dumb.  The phone started glitching badly yesterday, one week after warranty expiration.  Lol, typical.  I had to reset the phone 3 times today and the camera and gallery will both cause the phone to lock up requiring a hard reset.  Cannot recommend this or any Samsung phone.  Waste of money, resources, time and energy.  Back to LG quality for as long as I can get one.  None of my old LG phones have failed, they've been upgraded and put away, all still work fine.

I'm saying this because the quality of pictures is so bad that I don't consider this phone to have a camera at all. This camera takes legible pictures only in the most perfect of the perfect lighting conditions, and even then not always. Several times I lost important information that I needed for later use because I took pictures (many of them) of the same page, only to find later that all of them were fuzzy to the point of being illegible. I've never seen such a poor quality of camera before. And I've had numerous other brands: Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi. How can Samsung be worse that all of those budget companies? Well, turns out it can.What's also strange about this camera is that before it takes pictures, I see the image as always fuzzy. So when you are taking pictures you can't even know what the picture will look like because the image is always fuzzy before you take that picture. Again, it a bug unique for this phone, and no cheap brands I used before ever had it.2) The back of this phone is made of such a cheap material that after just 3 months of use it already has noticeable scratch/peel on it. I've been using the above mentioned cheap brands for years, never encased them in any covers, and they all looked like new. So in this feature Samsung is also worse that the cheap budget brands.3) On the second month of use, the phone started to lag constantly.4) Maximum sound available is so weak that I can barely hear incoming messages and calls notifications from another room. Videos can only be heard a couple of steps from the phone. Another bug I see for the first time.Realizing that I don't even have a camera to shoot important info on the go with this phone, I replaced it after 3 months. A gave a try to Samsung Galaxy 10 Plus, also bought on Amazon. It was brand new, and it's not a budget phone,  but it already had the weakest battery I ever had in my life, much worse than all those cheap brands I tried.After 2 gross disappointments with 2 Samsung phones, I lost my belief in Samsung. I also became clear why Samsung is for the first time behind Apple by smartphone shipments in 2023 after being a leader for 13 years. I think it's a company in a serious decline that still tries to charge a lot of money for its products just because of its past glory. I think I'm done with Samsung phones.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on March 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Una excelente opción de equipo a buen precio\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Linda', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on March 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llego en perfecto estado, lo recomiendo ampliamente\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Buena calidad, excelente compra', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on August 28, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Una excelente compra, el celular es tal cual la descripción\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'luis F.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 3, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Esta lento y a veces como que se quiere trabar, tuve un y9 2019 , y a pesar de haber salido hace 4 años con menos ram y menos velocidad , es mas rapido que el a14\nRead more'}]",MediaTek Helio,,Galaxy A14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-10-19

I get 3 days out of it.  However, I\'m seriously downgrading the overall review because of misrepresentation.  It\'s advertised as 6gb ram and it is actually 4gb.  This will affect you if you do serious multitasking or whatever.The ""excellent condition"" one I received really was -- not a mark on it.Another thing to be aware of: these refurbished, unlocked phones may have begun life as a carrier locked unit.  For instance, mine was an AT&T phone before.  Some carriers do not have updated databases which will show this phone as unlocked.I ran into this with ""Visible"" (Verizon budget carrier).  Their customer service is nearly non-existent so I switched to another budget carrier called ""Mint Mobile"" (basically discount T-Mobile) rather than go through the dance of getting them to recognize my phone as unlocked.So, despite the 3 stars I gave it, for the price you pay, this is actually an excellent phone.  If not for the misrepresentation, I\'d give it 4 at least.  The fingerprint reader on the power button is excellent.Worst characteristic of the phone is minor: it\'s somewhat thick compared to many phones these days -- but for me it\'s fine.  It is certainly worth the low cost here in refurbished phones.UPDATE: Heard from the seller and they have refunded me a reasonable amount of money for the 4gb vs. 6gb memory size.

I\'ll NEVER buy or ""upgrade"" another phone through my cell provider, what a ripoff.This phone delivers on all of their promises, comes with a screen protector AND a clear vinyl case to prevent scratches/normal wear.

Great choice"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2022', 'Review Body': ""I was worried it wouldn't really be unlocked based on some of the reviews here, but I decided to try it out since we get 90 days to return if anything.  Went to Cricket and successfully activated - hooray! Waited to order my screen protector and case until I knew for sure.The phone literally looks and feels new. If you look closely, the screen does have some very light scratches, but once I put the screen protector on, you can't see them at all. I'm so glad I went for it. It came with a charger, but I found it charged very slowly, so I just am using my same charger from Amazon that I used for last phone.I was able to transfer over most of my apps, contacts, and messages from my previous phone (galaxy 9) within about 15 minutes maybe less. Super easy, the phone does all the work for you. I love that the only apps it comes with are google apps, most of which I use anyway. I also noticed it has pretty good battery life. When it first arrived, I charged it and left it on (although didn't really use it at all) and that charge lasted for a week and 3 days before I went to Cricket to activate. I charged it that Saturday night and used it a considerable amount to transfer/ setup everything to my liking, did some Amazon shopping, note taking, little bit of Youtube and Spotify. Now it's Monday noon and I'm still at 44% . That far exceeds my expectations. The phone itself lives up to all the spec descriptions and has been easier than I thought to get used to navigating. The only thing I miss from my samsung s9 is the LED notification light, but I can get used to that. So glad I was able to get my hands on the pixel 5, I think it's so much prettier than the 6 and it's practically the same size as the galaxy s9, which is perfect for me.This is a great value for your money. There are a lot of cheap phones out there, but I think this one is on par specs and feature-wise with the more expensive flagships. Overall, highly recommend.If I don't update this with negative feedback in the future, that means I'm still happy with my purchase!Update: originally purchased Jan 2022. It's now August 2024 and this thing is running just as smoothly as the day i got it. I have run out of storage a couple times, which did make some apps run a little slower, but I backed up my photos & videos and deleted a bunch from my phone and it went back to normal. It doesn't have all the cool new camera features as the new pixels, but I still really like the camera and the photo magic eraser tool is really handy! It does rarely heat up more than normal, but if you leave it alone and let it cool down, it tends to be fine for heavy usage again. I will also note that I have dropped my phone plenty of times (with case & screen protector) and it is practically unscathed, still going strong after 2 and a half years. Normally the 2 year mark is when i start to have strange issues with a phone screen or performance but haven't had any with this one. Honestly, I think this is the first smart phone i haven't had any weird malfunctions with.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'David', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Awesome quality', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I recieved the phone much faster than the standard shipping indicated.

Upon seeing this phone I was convinced to switch from iPhone and that was a huge mistake. When I first got the phone I transferred all my stuff over to it including apps, pictures of my twins being born, and texts with people who are no longer here etc, and it successfully transferred and I was able to see them there; so after a week I sell my old phone, only to see days later that all my apps and pictures were deleted from this phone as if they were never transfered; I lost everything with no way to get them back. That should have been the first sign but anyways I got this phone about 8 weeks ago and around the 4th week is when it started to glitch even worse; after a full charge my battery would be back to 0% after about four hours of being off the charger; it takes about 16 hours for the battery to charge back up to 100% and sometimes the percentage will go down while actively saying it is charging (I have tried multiple wall chargers and portable chargers); it is virtually impossible to type coherent sentences because the keyboard doesn\'t register most of the letters I am typing and will insert random punctuation and emojis into my sentences, it makes me mistype my passcode often and then my phone locks up; do not open multiple tabs or apps while on this phone because if you switch to another app it\'ll delete everything you were doing on the previous page; most apps are not compatible to be downloaded to this phone even with the newest updates; my screen freezes a few times a day; for the past few days I have had to deal with the phone calling emergency contacts while I am not even using the phone; the camera has an automatic timer of 10 seconds so don\'t try to get any quick pics because the feature won\'t turn off no matter how many times you try; your photos cannot be viewed as a whole, if your photos somehow don\'t get deleted you will still have to decide which album to open and view photos there instead of them being collectively together, most of the time you\'ll just give up because this phone gives you about fifteen albums to search through; you can\'t use any features without unlocking your password such as camera, flashlight, changing music or anything; and then what has prompted me to write this is that this morning I turned my phone on and it froze as usual but this time it wouldn\'t let me restart or turn it off, it has been stuck on this screen for quite a few hours and I am realizing it is completely broken now.

I like CPU intensive games and it handles them like a champ. Screen is bright, colors are vibrant with lots of options. Sound it really good. The Pixel 6a does NOT have an SD expansion tray.

Mitchell', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Another great inexpensive Umidigi phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The Umidigi A15T is a great inexpensive phone in its expense class.I have had several Umidigi phones in the past and I can say from my experience they continue to improve and provide a good value for people looking for reasonable price vs performance phones.I purchased the glacier blue color which is a light blue and it was received very quickly as usual. The phone specs that I am usually concerned with are listed at the end of the review if you want to see that level of details otherwise here is my impression of this phone.The phone is well packaged in a recycling conscious box which includes a gray tinted semi- transparent protective case for the phone, wall charger, charging cord, sim tool, and small paper manual covering the very basics of the phone. A plastic type screen protector is already on the phone screen so it will be protected until you get a glass one if you use them.The fingerprint reader is the right side power button and is easy to setup as well as fast to unlock phone unlike some of the in screen fingerprint readers of other phones. The phone can keep up with me when I am entering the 6 digit unlock pin number when required. (many other phones do not and I have to type in the pin number slowly for them to recognize all the numbers) I don't turn on face unlock so I cant comment on that feature.I found the MediaTek processor/CPU can keep up with my needs with no real lagging or pausing while using multiple apps and only slowing slightly while doing numerous app updates from the app store all at once. Scrolling pages and other common browser tasks are fluid. I don’t use this phone for games so that may produce a different result if you game on your phone.Screen is bright enough with good color and clarity, resolution is moderate and refresh is not noticeable so that's pretty nice. Screen does get a bit overtaken in direct sunlight as expected.  The default home page app I didn't keep as I prefer Nova Launcher.  The default home app shows the icons across multiple pages requiring swiping to the right and left. The search box is at the last page to the right kind of like an iPhone.The rear camera system is comprised of a 3 circle area that contains a 64Mp sensor binned down to 16Mp @ F1.8 for main camera, a 5MP Ultra-Wide Camera @ F/2.2, and a 2MP Macro Camera @ F/2.4. Photos from the main camera are better than some previous models, ultrawide and macro are as expected and are social media level of quality. The phone app has several modes and features.When taking a picture there is very little delay between pressing button and it taking the picture.  Some of my other low cost phones had a long wait for the picture to actually be taken.Main camera video recording options are 4K,1080P, 720P, 480P; 30fps.  I don't see the option to turn on or off image stabilization so will go with it doesn't have it.The front selfie or video conferencing camera is a 16MP @ F/2.2 and seems to work well for Zoom calls.  If offers video recording at 720P, 480P ; 30fpsWifi stays connected around the house, shop and yard without issue.Bluetooth connects to my speakers, headphones and car.  Acts as expected for Bluetooth.AT&T cellular data and VoLTE calling is working provided by a Red Pocket MNVO sim. I did have to set the APN information for Red Pocket as usual. It has been on Red Pocket ATT for about 2+ weeks and its still calling out via VoLTE. Phone does not seem to offer Voice calls over Wi-Fi (VoWIFI) for Red Pocket AT&T.T-Mobile cellular data and VoLTE calling is working as provided by T-Mobile post paid sim. I did not have to set the APN information for T-Mobile. Phone does offer Voice calls over Wifi for T-Mobile as the menu item is present and controllable when using the T-Mobile sim.  Works well with T-Mobile in my area.Sound is very much a cell phone sound but the volume is good without heavy distortion. Call volume for speaker phone and handheld calls is loud and clear enough for the normal environments I use a phone in. If you are in a very noisy environment expect to have to actively listen.Still has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack so that's a plus.The specs are reasonable for the cost of the phone and include:Android 13 March 5 2024 security updates. Umidigi has improved over time at providing security updates but don’t expect Android version updates and other improvements as they are typically not provided.8GB Ram with the option to increase the available memory by utilizing storage space as operating memory. I appreciate the option is available but find 8GB is perfectly acceptable for my needs as a daily use smart phone.128GB Storage memory for storage of apps, pictures and all sorts of other data.The 128GB of storage can be increased in size with the addition of a micro sd card if needed and I tried a 64GB SanDisk that worked easily.CPU is a MediaTek G95 which is listed as a gaming level octa core processor by MediaTek.6.7” HD+ Full View Display, Resolution: 1650 × 720, Aspect Ratio: 20.6:9, Brightness: 500 nit (typ), and Contrast Ratio: 1500:1. Screen has slightly larger icons and text which works well for me. If you want to have lots of little icons packed in a small screen space then you cant do that with the default home app.  The screen has better color and clarity than the A15C but had to have them side by side to notice it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Eric Matsuoka', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A bargain for the specs and price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Design: In addition to the usual power and volume buttons on the right side, there is a customizable hot key on the left side.  You can choose what action you would like for a long press or a double press.  Or, if you don\'t want to use the hot key, you can have it do nothing.  Convenient if you have a program or two that you ""always"" use.  The screen is nice and big, and has very little bezel.  Thankfully no curved glass at the edges so no mis-touches when trying to play games.  Has a decently large battery but is not heavy. While that indicates the use of a lot of plastic instead of metal in the frame, I actually prefer a lighter phone to a more-durable but much heavier phone.  Uses USB-C for charging, and there is a standard headphone port!!!Included extras: There is an attached screen protector and a decent protective case included in the box.  The case has small lips that protects the camera and screen when you lay the phone down.Camera:  Gobs of megapixels but whatever, the most important thing to me is that photos come out very well (to me, a casual user), from close-ups to low-light indoor shots to brightly-lit outdoor shots (sample photos attached).Performance:  With 8 GB of ram and a decent mid-range processor, I have not had any slowdowns, freezing, or stuttering as I play Royal Match and browse web pages.  You can use two compatible SIM cards, or one SIM card and one micro SD card to add storage space (but the 128 GB of built-in storage space is more than enough for me).  There is great LTE reception and speed.  Not 5G but then a 5G capable phone at this price point would probably have an inferior processor, less ram, and/or less storage space.  There is NFC that works properly, too.  Battery life was not good on the first charge but improved notably on the second.  Now, I get a full day with just over 40% left in the evening.Overall: Highly recommended as long as you don\'t need 5G coverage.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ryan M.', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good Budget Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""For the price, this is a pretty decent phone. It's very light in the hands and looks more premium than the price I paid for it. I got the purple color and it's beautiful. In looks, it does look reminiscent of the iPhone though. The processor is fast and it takes gorgeous pics. So far, I don't have any complaints with it, but we'll see how it holds up with the test of time. I'd definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good, functional, affordable phone for everyday tasks.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'renee M', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Device or seller, idk which is worse.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nI hadthis device for less than a month when it started giving me problems.

With its sleek design and solid build quality, it feels good in hand and is perfect for anyone looking for an affordable yet capable device.Powered by a capable CPU, this phone delivers smooth and fast performance, whether you\'re multitasking, browsing, or playing games. The 8GB of RAM, expandable to 16GB, ensures that apps run seamlessly, and with 128GB of storage, expandable up to 1TB via TF card, there\'s plenty of space for all your needs.Its 6.7"" screen is a highlight, offering vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and a bright display that\'s perfect for watching videos and gaming. Some users even prefer this screen over more expensive models for media consumption.The camera setup on the A15T is impressive for its price point. The 64MP main camera, 8MP ultra-wide, 5MP macro, and 16MP front camera capture clear, vibrant photos, even in low light. The variety of camera modes, including electronic stabilization, adds to the versatility, making it a great choice for photography enthusiasts.With a 5000mAh battery, the smartphone easily lasts a full day on a single charge, and the 18W fast charging ensures you won\'t be left waiting long when you need a quick top-up. The energy efficiency of the device further extends battery life, making it reliable for all-day use.The A15T also includes NFC, a side fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and dual SIM support, making it not only secure but also highly convenient. The inclusion of a pre-installed screen protector, a silicone case, and an 18W charger in the box adds to the overall value, especially since many competitors have stopped providing these accessories.Overall, this smartphone is an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a budget-friendly option that doesn’t compromise on features. With its strong performance, great camera, and long battery life, it offers exceptional value for money as a solid mid-range smartphone that covers all the basics and more.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tom', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 19, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Arrived in nice box with it's own phone case, UK charger and screen protection (on the phone). It's a good looking phone, good size and not too heavy.Sticker on back of phone was difficult to peal off and took some effort to remove the adhesive and I scuffed the screen protection in the effort to remove it.The phone uses 'DDU launcher' and has a few umidigi apps on the phone that are unverified by Google play store (umidigi app store, weather, security, browser, themes) and are unable to be uninstalled. These appear to be non-malicious after scanning. The 'security' one is quite helpful to optimise phone performance. Even so I restrict their access apart from the DDU launcher which needs permissions for the phone to work properly. Transferring from one phone to another is initially quick, but takes time to reorganise icons and logging back into apps, but this is an android issue in general.So after the initial getting used to a new phone I am very pleased. I was really disappointed with the G5 mecha smartphone and this is a huge improvement. For the price it's very quick to use, apps don't crash and so far there are very few bugs that I have come across. Screen quality seems really quite good, (consider maybe tweaking miravision settings to get a good colour). Games and videos look great and are quick to stream. Sound also seems quite good and so far no issues with call volume. The NFC is very quick and works really well. Same with the fingerprint biometrics and the hotkey function is really useful once setup. Cameras seem good, takes some getting used to. For the camera it takes time to remove the 'watermark' for each type of camera (pro, selfie, macro, wide angle ..etc) in settings tab. However, I'm so grateful to get the wide angle camera back. My partner has the A15 and loves it as well, it appears to have more storage but this seems quicker.One thing to be mindful with umidigi phones is they cannot easily be upgraded to major android releases (once on android 13 always on android 13) if this doesn't bother you, phones can easily last 2-5years. It's a brilliant phone and hopefully saves you some money.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Roberto Matilla Augustinus', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on August 13, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es muy bonito, bien diseñado.

Phone still great for daily useI was tired of carrying around gigantic phones - but still needed Android for apps, android auto, and a decent camera. After looking around a bunch decided on picking this up. Also considered the Jelly but this seemed to have a better phone and more features. Feels great in your hand - but pretty thick compared to conventional devices. Height is perfect. Has everything you need - NFC payments, Face ID, fingerprint, a decent rear speaker, and pretty solid rear and front cameras. Works with Google Fi.My biggest issue is a really long lag after you take a picture while it seems to be saving it. Feels like 8-10s seconds. You can't take another photo and it seems to not save the photo if you switch out of the camera app too fast. It's a few less seconds if you decrease the default file size to 5 MP. The 48 MP shots take a really long time to save. Seems to do better with some 3rd party camera apps but still an issue. Kinda weird and makes you realize you comprimised a bit for a smaller form factor.Overall still glad I picked this up and I am done with giant 6+ inch screens\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Albino lopez', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': '20 days and so far...', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023', 'Review Body': ""A few adjustments on the display and you will be fine.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kelly Lienemann', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Value for an Unlocked iPhone XR Despite Minor Wear', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device\'s performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone.
