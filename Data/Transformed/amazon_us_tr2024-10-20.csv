I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'bolo919', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'After much research, trial and error, I bought this phone for several reasons:  1) Good screen size.. prefer the larger screen size than s23 or  s23 fe; 2) Adequate/decent performance specs of processor, camera etc 3) Expandable storage 4) Lowest SAR (radiation) values of any modern Esim phone Ive researched.. Yes i know they say its safe non-ionizing radiation... blah blah.. they said smoking and lead paint were ok too. I use my phone A lot.. tell it to the next guy buddy lol.  5) Price was reasonable enough. Anyway, the phone has been generally amazing so far, much faster and smoother than my old one.  Beautiful screen, although every once in a while some text has a barely noticeable very slight flicker on certain apps/ scripts? I shut off adaptive display something or other, which helped, but again barely noticeable and almost never happens.  Generally amazing, very fast, vibrant, and smooth thanks to the quality display and fast refresh rate.  I used a usb-c flash drive along with Samsung\'s ""Smart switch"" app to backup my old phone (motorola) then transfer onto the A35.  Esim setup was a breeze on US mobile\'s warp (verizon) network - so long as you have *this model* of the A35, which is the US Version (The US Version is A356u, NOT the cheaper latin american/ international A356E.. and probably also the international A55 could have compatibility issues too.. I dont know - I believe the a55 is only available in an international version - Samsung wants you to buy thd s23 fe instead.. The US unlocked models will have the best compatibility with your carrier if u live in the US - yes they are more expensive... anyway I digress)  So far this phone has been generally great.  I have purchased another one to have two lines on the A35.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Baltazar A.

Now, unless you’re a hardcore mobile gamer—like the type who could probably win a Fortnite match with your eyes closed—this phone should have more than enough juice for your everyday needs.For daily use, the A35 performs solidly. Its camera is decent, letting you capture everything from quick snapshots to carefully curated social media posts. And as for Samsung’s OneUI, Android purists might groan about the customizations, but I’m all for it. It’s a far cry from the old days of TouchWiz (anyone else remember that colorful chaos?), and now OneUI adds genuinely useful features like battery charging optimization that’s kinder to your battery health—something stock Android doesn’t offer out of the box, and you probably can’t just add on afterward, either. Plus, Samsung promises four major updates for the A35, which is impressive for a budget phone in this class, especially when competitors in this price range often tap out after one—if you’re lucky!The A35 also includes SD card support, so you’ve got plenty of space for photos, music, and all your favorite memes. My one real gripe? No raw API support for the camera. I mean, my cheaper Galaxy A9+ tablet has it—so what’s the deal, Samsung?At this price point, you could go for a flagship, but you’d be looking at the price of two A35s—or even three! For me, the A35 hits that perfect sweet spot of not-too-cheap and not-too-expensive. It’s affordable enough that you won’t feel like you need to keep it in a bulletproof case, but powerful enough that you won’t feel like you’re carrying around a paperweight. Overall, I’d say the A35 is like that dependable friend who always shows up with snacks but never leaves you broke.\nRead more'}]",25.062656641604008,B0CV4NH5T9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CV4NH5T9,5g

I purchased my original Moto 5G in 2019 and for a very long time I was very hesitant in replacing it with a newer version. Even though I did consider briefly buying a Moto 7G Phone in 2022 but I just wasn’t impressed with the unusual changes Motorola made just to make it look and work “different”. However, when I first saw this 2023 Version I was very happy to see that a lot things were back to the way I remembered them before changes they made to the Interface were actually ones that I liked. Such as Swiping down on the Homescreen “twice” instead of “once” to Auto-Rotate the Screen, which I used to accidentally do all the time. I know that something like this is very minor but it’s just one of the many ways Moto rethought the Interface to be more user-friendly.IMPORTANT POINTS:  This Phone has a Three-Day Battery Life, which is truly excellent! The feel, the weight and the look of it is really nice and it fits in my hand and pocket perfectly. The Display Screen and Refresh Rate is top notch and the Performance is Fantastic! Another BIG PLUS for me is that it has a 256GB of Storage as compared to 128GB. Also this Phone still has a Headphone Jack (Yay!) and it comes with a Phone Charger in the Box, which the 2024 Version does NOT have.THE ONLY NEGATIVE: For some reason Motorola thought that I wanted to have Tik-Tok and another App already Installed and it was difficult to remove it. By the way, I heard that the Moto g Power 5G 2024 has A LOT more of these Applications ALREADY installed, which is absolutely something I do NOT want at all.NOTE: I intentionally did NOT purchase the 2024 Version of the Moto g Power 5G partially because of the “reimagined” Interface, nor all of the massive amount of ALREADY installed “Bloatware” I’ve been reading about. Also, since I am very concerned about Security, I did NOT want the New NFC (Near Field Communications) which would include my Credit Card, Tap to Pay and other Financial information on my Cellphone. Although, I would have liked to have the New Wireless Charging Feature but it was something I able to live without.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'jeremy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything is Great, but please read if buying 2023 version', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Everything works fine. Very solid phone. Supports 5g. What\'s to complain?? Well, for me it\'s the charge speed. In this day & age not having fast charging is a sin. I will be keeping the 2023 version as a backup phone or might just return it. Just ordered the 2024 version which supposedly supports fast charging & wireless charging. Been charging this phone since I got it & it\'s been about 3 hours or so. I went from 40% to 61%. Literally as I\'m typing this. Just had to let people know since no one talked about it at all. If this isn\'t an issue for you, then this phone is your perfect phone. Otherwise I use my phone a lot so needing a full 5-6 hours to fully charge your phone daily is not ideal for me. Most reviews say Battery life seems to be quite good. Just the charge process seems bad. For me at least. I like to go out occasionally & knowing my phone will not easily charge fast should it hit zero doesn\'t put me at ease. For example like camping & using GPS or even using it to play music. In my experience phones will eventually die after a full day regardless of battery life. Meaning it will take at least 3-4 hours to hit 0% to 20%. Sorry, for the long scenario review. I just wished this product said it wasn\'t compatible with fast charging. Although to be fair it never said it did.Hope this helps anyone to make a solid decision on buying the ""2023"" version of the Moto G Power. This is a solid phone, just a bit of a relic in charge technology.-Originally 3 Star Review**Update**9/16/20242023 version works solid. Only been 2 days but I\'ve gotten the gist of it. It\'s definitely going to be my backup phone. No changes since my initial review. Battery life is standard. I don\'t play gaming apps much anymore so I can\'t say how gaming potential really is. Maybe someone else will do a stress test in regards to that. Still I\'m a bit bummed about the no NFC & charging seems to have gotten better. A bit inconsistent with charge speed, but maybe it\'s just me or it doesn\'t like my lightning cables. otherwise very solid phone. Overall review 8.5/10. Perfect if you aren\'t too nit picky about tech & current accessibility.2024 Version. Yeah, as I thought. Just using it I can feel it\'s more up to speed with modern times. Has NFC. Wireless Charge Capabilities. Camera is pretty good. Solid overall. With all the bells & whistles on battery life is good. I mean could optimize it to performance mode but what\'s the fun in that?? Otherwise this is a straight upgrade from the 2023 version. I wouldn\'t call it perfect, but I can say I can recommend it without hesitation. Definitely better than the LG G8 Thinq I had & I absolutely loved the LG G series. Oh & having the fingerprint scanner to the side where the power button is located is a nice feature. Although screen shots are a bit awkward if you try to use traditional inputs. This phone offers a shortcut. When placing 3 fingers (imagine a dog/cat paw formation) on the screen it will take a screenshot.  Although the emergency override with +Volume & Power button are both on one side so that\'s definitely annoying. Probably my only real con. 9.5/10, I would say it\'s a 10 but there are better phones out there. However for the Best bang for your buck. This is definitely a steal.-5 stars for both versions now that I understand what I\'m working with. Unfortunate that I was unsatisfied with the 2023 version, but like I said. Would make a great backup phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Spinner', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on May 15, 2023', 'Review Body': 'This my 3rd Moto phone over the past 9 years.

Thanks to Motorola for listening and adding NFC for easy Google pay. The Pale Lilac color is incredibly good looking and the vegan leather is so easy to hold and feels high end. I am also happy with the OIS camera, beyond solid. Glad I returned the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G for this.

And the reason it's a piece of junk is because Motorola has messed with the basic Android that Google supplies and calls it Motorola Android and Motorola has no competent programmers to be messing on anything that Google puts out for programming on phones. These people were not even smart enough to put in a selection to look at all the apps that are installed. They only put in a selection to look at the most recent apps in the default apps. The standard Google Android has both. I'm trying to save you from wasting five or six hours of your life trying to set up with this thing so that it'll actually work and has the stuff that was on your old phone to use. I'm going to add to this that the notifications have stopped working properly. You spend more time trying to administer this phone instead of being able to actually use it to get any work done. And I would never ever consider doing any online banking with a piece of crap phone like thisUpdate when I got this phone somebody had set the gestures attached to the power button to turn on Google Assistant instead of restarting the phone. It's taken me numerous hours to finally figure out how to fix this issue. In my opinion this was not a new phone but it was advertised as new.Update 9/4/24 This phone is like all the other g series I have owned since 2022 which is 3 of them.  All of them have this uncontrolled scolling problem where the screen will all of a sudden scroll at speed up or down. This has been a problem with the last 4 Motorola phones I have had.

Everything is just intuitive and very easy to get along with. For text message codes, it lets you copy the code in the notification or it will auto-capture the code so you can just paste it into the app you need to. With my Samsung phones, that feature was always hit or miss. The camera is great and captures great images and video. Even the front facing camera is great quality and you can get nice selfies on it. Definitely make sure you grab a case for it and I would also recommend a glass screen protector. I can't believe how inexpensive this phone was for how great it is.

The build quality is top-notch, and the design is sleek and premium, giving it a luxurious feel in the hand.One of the standout features for me is the advanced camera system. The images are incredibly detailed, even in low-light conditions, and the array of shooting modes allows for creative flexibility. The battery life is impressive as well, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use without a hitch.Being unlocked and Android-based means I have full control over my device and can switch carriers or customize settings without hassle. The software experience is smooth, with Samsung’s enhancements adding value without overwhelming the core Android experience.Overall, the SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a high-performance, feature-packed smartphone.

I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone, fast processor 256gb memory at ok price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""When a phone costs $1000 it better be special.

The Ulephone had failed due to a leaky battery.The Moto G was easy to set up. First, I opened up the box and noted that the user manual had a ""quick start"" manual that was too brief.  As per the quick start leaflet I put in the memory card and the sim card from my old phone. The battery showed a 60% charge so I immediately shut down the phone and charged it up to 100%.  Meanwhile I did a search for ""Moto G Play 2023 User Manual"" and downloaded the 62 page  (very useful) ""User Guide.""  Be sure to get this manual (is is a pdf file) and it is full of  information.  The old SDcard needed to be reformatted and this manual tells how to do this. The Moto G has an Andriod 12 operating system and has ""VOLTE"" which is a requirement in our area for using the local AT&T cell towers.VOLTE give you more range and greater clarity than the old communications protocol. After about 90 minutes of charging I was at 100% and I did the initial; startup procedure  described in the downloaded manual.  The phone connected to the AT&T tower with no problems.  I made my first phone call and the sound level was more than adequate.  I have a hearing disability so I expect most people would say that the phone is \'loud.""  I also downloaded a Kindle book  ($2.99)  that told me details about using Android 12. If you want the book  do a search on the Amazon site for ""Android 12 user manual"".  Most people will not get this manual but I am happy to have the extra information provided in this well-written book about the Android 12 OS.  I bought the Moto play because I needed a phone and did not care about playing games, reading kindle books, or ""living on the phone.""  The Moto G can do all of that but you would be better off to buy a much more advanced unit that costs several time as much as the Moto G.  I much prefer using a separate (large) Kindle for reading, a  dedicated gaming computer,  and  desktop computer with multiple screens for other activities.  Overall, the Moto G does exactly what I wanted (a good phone)  at a reasonable price.  I also downloaded a few apps from the app store and they worked properly.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ibrahim A.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': '10/10', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': 'okay, it came In a weird packaging so I was suspicious it was absolutely wonderfully packed tho. it came in a small box, iphone in bubble wrap and then a lighting cable to charge in a plastic bag. the screen had no scratches, the back was wonderfully brand new, I chose yellow . It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase!

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice.

The A15 4G international version definitely works on the Bell network in Canada, and the total cost to get it shipped to my door was around $280 CAD for a phone a little over $160 USD. The phone arrive in perfect condition WITH a phone charger within a few days. I am lifelong Motorola user for my personal phone and have a newish S23 for work. At the USD price of this phone, the A15 4G really does blow away competitor 4G phones at this price range, but I was a bit nervous about leaving my 100% reliable, but super clunky Moto behind.There are a lot of excellent online reviews for the A15 4G/5G, but some of highlights of this international version include full 1080 HD OLED display (which is great), 6 GB of ram (most are 4 GB at this $ range), NFC for financial transactions (less common in sub $200 phones), and the promised extended  support for Android updates / security patches. The 4G is also dual sim, but you have to make a choice with the second slot - either a second sim card OR an SD card for more memory.  Whatever version of the A15 4G/5G phone you purchase, read the phones specs carefully. There are a lot of common features between the various versions of these phones, but differences appear to occur. For instance, the 5G A15 is single sim and Samsung states NFC is region specific. The official version of this phone in Canada only has 4GB of ram at this time.So far this phone has worked extremely well, and it is a user experience that approximates my work S23. You are not going to get a great game experience, world shattering photos or film your YouTube  content with this phone, but it is great for standard phone activities. This is a low end Samsung phone, so that requires a little caution. This phone could well have some unidentified issue that will impact all users (e.g. battery probs. or random rebooting etc.) However, off the starting line, this phone appears to be excellent value.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lexi’s best', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The quality is great and it uses two sim', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The size is great and the features the camera quality looks great, easy to use it came unlocked and it’s working great\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great unlocked phone for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Works as advertised.

Only negative is that it 100% needs a case for comfortable hand usage, too slippery otherwise.

First week with it, the only thing I can stress is remember the R when purchasing accessories.  I don't recall if I picked the case due to it being suggested or if I found a case separately.  What I can say is the case I have doesn't cover the cameras as well as it would, and the power button doesn't sit well in the fitting on the case.  I reviewed my orders and saw the case was for a OnePlus 12 and not a OnePlus 12R.  That being said, it was probably my fault and I ordered a new 12R case and will eat the loss on the first case.  Not a big deal.  Battery drains significantly faster than my previous phone, but it was a powerhouse (Ulefone Power Armor 18T), so my basis for comparison is quite a bit larger/longer lasting.  The processing power and speed is way up from the Ulefone though.  Ultimately happy with my purchase.  This phone is wafer thin and insanely light compared to the Ulefone as well.  I do kinda miss the heft and insanely bright torch!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Cristian SOVI', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 9, 2024', 'Review Body': 'El teléfono llego bien en su caja y todo sellado, cargador tipo americano\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fabián Landa', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on August 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llegó muy bien y en buen estado\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Carolina', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on June 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Me gusta su nuevo diseño y características, gran capacidad de memoria.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Víctor Hugo Sánchez', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on June 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es muy fluido su batería dura mucho y no se calienta.\nRead more'}]",11.686143572621036,B0CQ9SZJN6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CQ9SZJN6,5g

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* \U0001fae2 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dona', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people.  I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it.  It is on a carrier that is not one of the ""big names"".  It suits my purposes fine.My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe.  This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there.  Believe me, I tried.  The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone.  I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering.  I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating.  They did not disappoint!The first phone I purchased was purple.  It arrived in excellent condition visually.  No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone.  It charged up to 82% which was great.  Everything was wonderful.  Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user).  I couldn\'t hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion.  Nope, wasn\'t me.MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone.  They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me.  The replacement phone was blue, but that isn\'t an issue.  It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new.  It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a ""new"" phone and to do your research on sellers.  Amazon offers an amazing choice to pick from.Hope that helps.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'B.

That old phone only went up to Android 13, while this one came with 14. Snapchat makes proper use of the Android camera API for the pixel, so my photos look wayyyy more crisp on this phone. The camera on this phone is a bit meh in comparison to the oneplus I had, but the macro lens is pretty amazing on this phone.I use bitwarden and it would almost never autofill on my oneplus, but this autofills on every single app I\'ve tried, the app integration and amount of random little QoL features are amazing.I\'m not a fan of the default home launcher, but after installing lawn chair 14, I have way more customizability and I was able to really make this phone feel like my own.The battery life is wonderful, I was a bit worried that it wouldn\'t have much because it\'s not the ""pro"" version of the phone but it lasts me ~1.5 days with pretty regular usage. Even while using the 120hz display.The size feels way more comfortable than the the massive oneplus, and I\'m honestly glad I didn\'t get the 8 pro. I have pretty big hands, I don\'t know who they\'re making these huge phones for. If you want to watch movies with a large screen, just get a cheap tablet.

It's very human sounding and works better than any other call screen service I have ever used.****IMPORTANT NOTE****  Asurion is a scam.  In my experience, If you ever have to file a claim they will make the process as difficult as possible.  When you sign in to the app to file a claim you have to sign in three separate times.  The form they want you to fill out does not self-populate your name, address, phone # etc.  You’ll then need to enter various other information, and they want a pic of both the front and back of your driver’s license (remember, you logged in with a UN and PW).  Once you upload all of this, they tell you it will take 24 business hours to review.  First, they reject the form stating you must print and sign the form even though it says you can sign electronically.  If you call their number, they will place your call on hold for a while and initially an automated message will attempt to tie up your call having you answer various questions.  Eventually someone in a foreign country will answer your call.  The initial person will try to sell you additional services and after you say no a couple times, they will transfer you to someone else.  You guessed it, you will have to be on hold again.  You will get transferred and placed on hold several more times and they will find a way to deny your claim.  What is especially frustrating is you have followed all their directions along the way.  They can (and will) raise service fees without any notice.  In the end, you will not save any money and have spent far too much time submitting forms and talking to people that lie and misdirect you every step of the way.  The company’s employees are dishonest and have no problem lying to you.  You can give it a try if you want but you have been warned.

I've had a handful of awful Samsung phones including the ones Samsung would kill, (had two of the same model and they both died a day or two away from each other) like they were scheduled to be a brick.

It began lagging more and more. Storage was full and apps wouldn\'t update because there supposedly wasn\'t enough space, regardless of the size of SD card I installed. The very definition of ""planned obsolescence"". Wanting to avoid this with my next phone, I bought something with more storage and memory this time around.SCREEN:After 2 Galaxy A15\'s had phantom screen press issues I decided to give the A25 a try since online resources suggested it had a different screen. Thankfully I\'ve yet to have any phantom screen press issues about 2 months since receipt.Per gsmarena.com the A15\'s features a 800-nit screen, while the A25 features a 1000-nit screen. The noticeable difference here is that the A25 is actually usable in sunlight. The A15 is too dim. This is very important, and I feel a huge drawback of the A15.BATTERY:I subjectively feel like the A25 runs down the battery a bit faster than the A15. This does make sense given the hardware. Per nanoreview.net the SOC of this phone is more powerful than that of the A15, with a lower battery life rating. Per gsmarena.com the A25 has a 120Hz screen vs. the 90Hz of the A15, while both phones feature 5000 mAh batteries.Either someone at Google decided to finally build battery charge thresholds into Android after 14 versions (better late than never?), or this phone, due to price point and/or hardware, supports them. This should help improve battery lifespan of this phone.Neither the A15 or A25 feature wireless charging. I don\'t care. You might.HARDWARE:I DO care that both feature 3.5mm jacks. They make life so much better. Locating it on the bottom, unlike the A01\'s top-mounted 3.5mm jack, makes it easier to route a cable when it\'s in a pocket or car mount.It supports either dual SIM or one SIM and a microSDXC. This also makes life much better. I wish it could hold 2 SIMs AND a microSDXC at once, but it\'s better than nothing I suppose.The cameras are pretty good, but get grainy/pixelated when zooming in. My camera needs are modest compared to some, so I\'m satisfied.The notch for the front camera is fine. In fact I grew to like the status info (battery, WiFi/cellular, notification icons, etc) being at the top, next to the notch, in the A01, giving more room to apps.The inclusion of stereo loudspeakers is a nice upgrade from the A15, especially considering the price increase. If you hold the phone at an off-angle they can sound strange due to the angle. For best results hold the phone with the screen flat toward your face.It gets a bit warmer than the A15. A quick internet search suggests it\'s the Exynos SOC. Thumbs down.I\'m not particularly tough on my phones, so the plastic construction is fine for me. I put it in a silicone case. This makes it easier to grab, and was potentially far less expensive than buying a phone with metal construction.SIZE:The phone\'s too big*. The A01 was too big at 5.7"", and the A25 is worse 6.5"". I have long fingers and it\'s impossible to reach the top of the screen (where one might find a close or menu button in an app) one-handed without major grip adjustment, risking dropping the phone. The A01 was borderline uncomfortable in the (large) pockets of my pants, the A15/A25 cross the border. Squatting down must be carefully done lest it dig into your hip and cause discomfort or pain. Yes viewing more of web pages is nice. Yes I have to thumb to the next page of ebooks less when there are more words on-screen. Yes, more screen real estate is nice for Google Maps. But I don\'t NEED those things. In fact, I\'d rather have an easier-to-carry PHONE, not a PHABLET I have to buy military cargo pants or a purse to comfortably carry.SOFTWARE:Mostly stable and as-expected: minimal changes to Android and the usual Samsung bloatware. There are some issues but I\'m not sure if I can blame Samsung.1. Expo Go (an app used for mobile app development) doesn\'t allow interaction with the app I\'m helping develop. Expo Go itself works fine on both the A15 and A25, but the in-development app would appear frozen. The in-development app works perfectly on Expo Go on the A01.2. ** 2nd Edit: The issue has resurfaced, and I\'ve had to switch to a different camera app. Edit: this issue appears to have been resolved, perhaps via one of the updates the phone received since I wrote about it. Original issue text: ""I set the ""side button"" (power button) to turn on the flashlight when double-pressed. Using the included camera app before using the side button to turn on the flashlight results in the flashlight not working. This can be fixed by clearing the camera app\'s cache every time you want to use the flashlight, or using a different camera app. For all I know there\'s a fix for these, but I haven\'t found it yet (and I\'ve looked).""3. Some third-party apps fail to start and require a second screen tap.VALUE:This phone is exiting the budget segment toward mid-range, but you get more for your money compared to an entry-level phone. More computing power, more storage and memory, an ultrawide camera, stereo speakers, a better screen than the A15, while retaining a 3.5mm jack.*But ""the market"" wants big phones (see the Marques Brownlee video ""Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them"" video for more).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Passingby', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'the best phone for the $$$$', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've only had it for a few days now and it's hurting me to send it back because someone got me the s24 Plus for free BUT BUY THIS PHONE!!!. it feels and runs like a high end phone, I loved the pictures it took and the all around feel of it.

I was an hour away from our house and received a call from my wife. Signal wasn't the greatest but at least I could understand her. When I went to leave, I opened Google Maps to show me the way home.

I am impressed.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I\'m someone who isn\'t picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I\'d honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn\'t so hard to get by in today\'s day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I\'m not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn\'t obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don\'t know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I\'m sure it isn\'t the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don\'t worry, I clear them when I\'m done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it\'s pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I\'ve seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality.

I was looking for something that wasn\'t one of the mainstream brands like Samsung, Apple, etc. I like the features (decent storage, can use external storage, large screen, comes unlocked, good battery life with quick charging, various widgets, so many settings, and more) and the lack of ""bloatware"" that comes with the phone.There are 2 things that I don\'t like about the phone compared to my last one (Google Pixel 3).1, that I was aware of from other reviews, is the camera is not the best. Sometime you need some really good light for the picture to come out decent, otherwise pictures can be rather dark. I find myself editing them often to brighten them up. That and it lacks the crispness that you can get with phones like the Google Pixel and others. Besides that, it has some cool camera options, like professional mode (which if I learned how to use that I\'m sure my images would come out a bit brighter), macro, others, and some of the editing tools are pretty cool.And 2, something that bugs me enough to note it here, is the responsiveness of the screen. I don\'t think it is an app issue as it has happened with multiple apps, but sometimes while swiping in a direction, it doesn\'t always respond the way I want it to. For example, I use Spotify very frequently, and it\'s where I get annoyed at this issue the most. In Spotify, when you are viewing a song you can swipe from right to left to change a song, or swipe down to get out of the song view, taking you back to a menu screen. So many times, it does not register my swipe to the left, instead it registers it as a downswipe, exiting the screen I was on. And like I said, this happens with other apps too, where I\'m trying to swipe across, but instead it registers as a downswipe exiting the screen I was on.Other than the 2 issues I have with this phone, it\'s honestly great for the price. I\'m disappointed with the camera sometimes, but that is coming from my previous phone\'s camera being so crisp and bright, and I also knew about it based on the other reviews I read. And the swiping issue can be annoying, but it is tolerable.Overall decent phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tadeo Herrera', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 11, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Los atributos están a la altura de un gama alta.. la velocidad y su estética los mejores y no se diga la calidad de la cámara y el sonido por el precio es excelente !!!\nRead more'}]",16.722408026755854,B0C22BRGLG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C22BRGLG,5g

Zorach', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very Happy With This So Far: Great Phone for Great Price, But Some Key Downsides', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I\'ve been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it\'s a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.Things I like about this phone: it\'s relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It\'s great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don\'t like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can\'t make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It\'s a big downside because now I can\'t use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don\'t have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it\'s not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It\'s not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry. I refuse to pump big money into an industry that isn\'t representing my values and the things I care about in life.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jessie Asuncion', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Worked like a charm', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My last purchase on Amazon  with a refurbished phone, I got totally burned.

Even the plastic bag which it came with stated so. When I powered the unit for the first time it had no problem booting to the setup screen which was in Spanish and indicated that its 5000mAh battery was 50% charged. Although it wasn\'t difficult to change the language to English, I decided to power it down and wait until it was fully charged before continuing with the setup. This took around 30 minutes to complete. I needed to completely transfer as much of my data, folder, contacts and apps from my old Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime to this Samsung Galaxy A25 5G so I used the free Samsung app from the Google Playstore to accomplish this. The transfer over wifi took a few hours and only left out 5 apps which were relatively unimportant and easilly reloaded to the new phone from the playstore.Trying to save a few bucks, I then tried to switch my sim card from the old phone to the new phone myself. I followed the online instructions provided by Metro by T-Mobile, but this is where I encountered a problem. The IMEI number was not recognized by Metro and suggested I call for assistance. I wondered if the negative comments about this phone not being truly unlocked and not working in North America were true, so I decided to stop at this point and just wait until I could visit the nearest Metro store for help.The following morning, I did so. To my surprise it only took all of under 5 minutes and at a cost of $26.78 for a new sim card plus an activation fee to have me out the door with my old phone number successfully transferred to the new phone. Since then, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G seems to be functioning just fine. I love how bright and clear the screen is. Its responsive and easy it is to use inspite of the fact that it is light years more advanced that my old one. I\'m still learning about all its innovations and how to use it properly. Imagine, within a day of receiving this new phone I went from a smartphone using Android 7.11 OS to Android 14 OS!!! Would anyone believe that had I not needed to switch to an an Android OS of 11+ just to be able to utilize my car\'s Andro Auto Infotainment System fully, I would still be using my old J7 Prime?!Though not as powerful as the latest Galaxy S or N models, its specs including it\'s screen, video and multi-camera resolutions, refresh rate, processing unit, tactile response and even its storage expandability are fairly impressive if not respectable at such an affordable prize. If down the road I find anything to dislike or complain about it, I\'ll be sure to write an addendum to this review. In a nutshell ... I can vouch that this phone works just fine with Metro by T-Mobile cellular carrier in Florida (or at least my neck of the woods, East Central Florida) and can make calls either over wifi or just using cellular data.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Katie', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A great phone!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone is truly a middle range device. It's has excellent response feedback from the interface and buttons. Not to large to fit in a pocket. The battery life is pretty good. Charging it takes a little bit longer if you don't have fast charging cables. I purchased this device to use with service provider Mint Mobile. Works great, and almost $200 less expensive than Mint Mobile. It is also $100 less expensive than at Best Buy or Samsung. The listing states it's an international unlocked device and in comparison to US version, the SIM card slots are the only difference. Now Samsung did install a significant amount of bloat ware, but can be uninstalled. Now there is Samsung Protection Application that is a pain in the butt. Can't uninstall it.

My bf and I were very worried due to the mixed reviews. Although some of the reviews were bad I did not share the same experience.The box is secure with two white stickers on each side which is how the Google pixels are sold. When I took my phone out of the box it was in perfect mint condition and came with a USB c to USB cable. Beautiful and sexy design love the chrome detail on the camera.Charger: I did have to purchase a charging block for it. The battery was not charged so I charged it and it quickly came to 100 %. Battery lasts like a good day and a half and probably would last longer if I didn't use it so much.*** Now it did have a att card in there (like reviews stated) but I found out that an unlocked att phone that's brand new does look like that from att. ( Yes I physically called att to get to the bottom of this) The reps assured me that the seller has brand new unlocked att phones which are compatible with any carrier. Not dishonest seller like reviews had me assuming.Activation: My bf called our service provider Metro and the transfer to my phone was very fast. Took him 10 minutes and my phone was up and running. After I turned on and off my new phone like 2 times the phone was active.Functionality: I am very impressed with the speed of this phone. It's fast! If you like playing games or are like me and do everything from your phone this phone is great! Internet surfing, and multitasking is a breeze. So many free apps from note taking, games, reading, shopping, financial and more.Camera: This phone takes absolutely beautiful pictures. I even had no makeup and it looked decent not fuzzy or grainy or lack luster. When you tap the screen you can adjust contrast and brightness with out having to click edit separately. There are also really cool editing features I have not tried yet that look really cool.Still learning this  phone and the many features I haven't discovered.There are a lot of cool features like you can circle something on the screen at any time and it looks it up. Phone calls are written in words  on the screen for people who are hard of hearing during call. Very cool backgrounds during Google meet call very similar to face time features. I feel Google meet is a lot better than FaceTime (don't come for me lol). I am a previous iPhone user and there are some features of this phone that are simply better.Cost: This phone is a budget phone and still up to date with current updates and is a new phone. I refuse to spend a mortgage/rent payment on a phone. I just simply can't bc these phone prices are just insane for getting a current year phone. This one is last year's model + everything I wanted and more.Display: phone is very bright and the display is beautiful. Brightness can be adjusted bc it is a very bright phone which is great. Colors are vivid and clear making photo experience and gaming more fun.Sound: The sound is pretty loud. During calls I find myself lowering the volume. Whether you are using speaker phone or regular audio.Google users: if you do everything on Google and love the Google platform it intensifies your enjoyment. Everything transfers over and all your pictures and routine bc a breeze!I will update you all later on but at this point I couldn't say more good things ;) Just get it.** I am taking time to address all the negative feedback that almost deterred me from buying an amazing phone. I had the phone for three weeks and will be back with updates. Get yourself an OtterBox or something like it bc this phone has glass backing and if your like me than order it the same time you get the phone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tommy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Glad I Bought It-Great Phone So Far', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I've been with Verizon for years and always bought new phones through Verizon. This is my first unlocked phone purchase. I'm on a Verizon Family Plan and the plan for all lines was upgraded to a 5G Unlimited Data plan not long after 5G went live. I stuck with my 4G-LTE Moto Z2 Play until now when I pulled the trigger on this Google Pixel 7 Pro (512GB). The phone arrived at my door delivered by Amazon Prime next day. After I first turned on and set up the new Pixel 7 Pro I turned it off then I took the SIM card out of my old beat up Verizon Moto Z2 Play and I dropped it into the SIM slot of my new Google Pixel 7 Pro phone, turned the phone back on, and voilà! The phone immediately connected to 4G-LTE initially and I got frowny face, but about 3 minutes later it automatically switched and connected to 5G with 5 bars and I got big smiley face. It's been a solid 5G connection ever since. It was just that easy-peazy for me. The phone is snappy and responsive. Phone calls are crystal clear and sound amazing. The screen resolution and picture is fantastic. Super HD quality when watching 1080P or 4K. The speakers of the phone on speaker-phone sound fantastic, and the speakers sound fantastic even when listening to music or watching a video. The volume goes up very loud and it still sounds very good with little to no volume distortion (depending on the source audio). Bluetooth devices are pairing perfectly and without issues. So far, all the features of the phone work great. Security seems tight and the facial recognition and fingerprints work flawlessly thus far. The camera takes extremely good photos and video and even in very low light they come out very good. I'm trying to think of negatives and I can't really come up with any right now—except maybe that there are a whole heckuva lot of settings of all kinds that you can adjust, which isn't really a negative at all, but it takes a long time to get it all dialed in on an unfamiliar phone. Security options are many which is a good thing. I'm very happy I pulled the trigger on this so far and I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'verified purchase' negative reviews because this Google Pixel 7 Pro rocks.

I’m passionate about smartphones, and I’ve loved previous high end Androids. This has a few key advantages over those devices.Simplicity. I used to compile my own Gentoo. I understand the value of FOSS. Still, I’ve come to decide that a personal communicator/ data assistant needs to be usable above all else. iOS is feature-complete, thoughtfully efficient, and free of redundancy beyond Android. The toddler’s interface i used on the iPod touch has matured into what it was meant to beReliability. I’ve never had big problems with Android, but it can hiccup. On every phone I’ve used over more than a decade, I’ve occasionally experienced minor crashes, GPS gremlins, battery drains, cooling anomalies, and inscrutable major app discontinuations. In nearly a year of use, this old midrange iPhone has been utterly rock solid and i am confident Apple will not yank the rug out from under any of its core utilities. I do not manage the RAM on this phone or track battery usage. It’s just normal at all times.Durability. I do not use phone cases. The concept is a bit bizarre to me from a design standpoint. It’s not ideal, but i just try to be very careful with my phone. I’m good enough at it that, since smartphones emerged, it has been overall worth it for me despite eventually breaking two phones in that period. Still, I’m aging and I’ve dropped it. It’s clear that this phone is comprehensively designed; the materials and structure are unbelievably resistant to impact on hard surfaces. The damage to my phone is entirely cosmetic to the aluminum frame, and frankly makes me smile that it worked as intended in the face of adversity.Performance. My last phone had significantly more raw computing power than this phone. Still, this phone has a smoother UI and, in my opinion, marks a significant point of diminishing returns in mobile processing power. Clearly, little of the hardware is wasted. It is well balanced.Criticisms include: the ability to edit large blocks of text in iMessage has degraded since the last update. Moving the cursor has become more difficult. Battery life is mediocre. I can confidently get a day of normal use or a few hours of streaming video, and i have to charge it every night. My refurbished phone arrived with a gouge in the screen which i consider barely acceptable.The experience is great. I’ve lost interest in cracking software and customizing each UI element with unlimited freedom in favor of a workflow that aligns with my long-term goals. In that regard this phone excels. Lovely bit of hardware and software.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'bsan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great product.

The product that was originally sent out to me had a broken microphone for video recording. The battery health was at 81% (not terrible because Amazon guarantees a 80 or higher, so it wasn’t super bad but just wasn’t ideal). There were very minute scuffs to the top of the phone but nothing bad, more like you can tell someone might’ve lightly brushed the phone along a wooden table and slid it or something. The main complaint was that the product was faulty. So I sent it back.Secondly, the pros.MOBILESUPPLY was fast with replying, regardless of the time. They were fast and helpful with the process. A few days after I shipped the phone, they received it and shipped it to me the next day. The phone right now has a few scuffs but again, nothing too bad, you’d have to look at the phone from very specific lightings and angles to see the very SMALL and light scuffs.

Works fine.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The exterior is in perfect condition and so far it’s operating like my previous one iPhone XR. I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kelly Lienemann', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Value for an Unlocked iPhone XR Despite Minor Wear', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device\'s performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone.

The camera is great, even at 8x zoom. Night photos were awful at first but by it improved greatly by increasing the aperture open time to 6s from 3s. Astrophotography is just wow. Pictures look better in the gallery than in the camera so it's post-processing more than hardware but hey, as long as I get crisp shots.Fingerprint sensor is not good. Often doesn't recognize my prints and works slower than my iPhone 6s I just switched from. Someone on reddit said to register the same finger twice but it didn't help much.I was concerned about the battery because the one on my 6s was awful and I didn't want to care about conserving battery on a regular day ever again.

These are so expensive but there treated like scratch technology.  After using it for a couple days I can say the camera is great but I did think it needed a better face for the video capture but thats one of the small things you notice about cameras, they may look better in person than the camera for video capture meaning that you need a really attractive face or its a character and what features do you like about the character and what you don't, its one of things about the technology that I really found to be one of the potential problems because real life interactions are usually better but for photos I was thinking these are better than video capture.After really looking at the image quality I think its lacking in comparison to an IMAX for daytime photos and the video capture in 4K didn't quite meet my expectations for film, I wouldn't be using this for filming Planet Earth, a huge amount of data in the imagery that was non existent, not as good as the photographs at 8.3MP at 4K.  These are great for using if you don't have an expensive camera but don't expect it be a replacement for the film industry.  Comparing the video quality to someone elses it did look like mine was out of focus, it does seem to be how I was panning the camera that it was going out of focus or something, the quality didn't really look worse but there was some motion blur.Really looking at the image quality for distance photos I needed better quality images, im feeling like I needed a better camera and when compared to a less expensive smartphone these are great images but thats only this much better for distance photos and yhea there better selfie images of faces but its also a different style of quality, the faces look different, they look like completely different people being photographed and that means you might like how the person looks with a different phone because of the difference.After using the phone for enough time to determine if I needed a case protector, ive decided it almost feels like if I was using it alot and not being as careful id definitely need to get one but so far it doesn't seem like im going to drop this phone, Ive not used it enough in a way id need case protector but im sort of feeling like id need one, im using the box it came with and that seems sufficient for storing it but it could use a case protector or something else to store it in but it seems like an extra cost until its used in a way that it would feel like it needed one for sure but im not using it quite like that so im ok for now but it does feel that way.  I don't wanna replace it or if there was enough damage that it didn't work id need it, im already feeling like its not for any fast movements, I can probably use it without mostly but as soon as I start using it in a certain setting I need a case protector, like im already feeling like I want to buy one just so its there to use if I needed one.I found where the camera is lacking for photos and that is anything to do with distance and leafs or bright sunlight shining at the camera somewhat as in it didn't look better than a smartphone less than half the price but for most photos it does work and it doesn't have any effect of something being tall.  The quality of the images does still need to be better for a photographer, id consider upgrading to a better camera at this part of my experience with the phone but it does show enough detail to be impressed with the level of detail.After quite of bit use with this camera im really looking for a higher quality image, im quite satisfied with the closeup photos and the distance are quite good to but if you looked at the photographs from the most expensive cameras you would be looking for better image quality.  It really struggles to look the same as the eyesight.  I realized what it was that wasn't quite there after really examining the photo quality is that you need to take professional photos with a PhaseOne or something similar to it, the Huawei smartphone cameras take great photos and so do the Pixel phones but the file size is completely different, these are fantastic images with the smartphones but your comparing them now.What I found somewhat of a complication with previewing the larger non smartphone cameras is that theres alot of settings and options on them that you may not understand at first making smartphones the easiest decision for actually taking photos but the need to see the the highest quality image is there in my mind.I am finding that if you want to zoom in after you take a photo it is to blurry and that is even from two feet away so it seems to be that there is interest in taking higher quality photos than this.  I was looking at it like it was important for that to be better or you'd need to take a macro photo.Looking at it from the perspective of thickness in the image of the detail, I can't feel these enough even though the image quality is really good, there not 3d, its a very flat image and you'll notice that with the really high mega pixel cameras it has the right amount of detail and this was enough but it also needed additional detail, its reaching the distance but its not quite there yet.Im just looking at these photos and thinking I really don't like that the clarity that you'd see with the eyesight or a really expensive camera isn't there and though I can zoom in and it looks better, I can zoom in and it looks better but 94% zoom im thinking these should be clearer, 146% zoom the background looks like a painting, 200%+ zoom these are not clear enough at all.  Id really think that close up photos are good but theres still a level of not being able to focus the camera, it needs a stand or something.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Muhammad Omair Ali', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on June 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Nice, I like the product and working good\nRead more'}]",,B0CYQ916ZY,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CYQ916ZY,5g

Better than expected.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've been using the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2022) for about a year now, and overall, it’s a solid phone, especially for the $140 price point. I see that they have increased the price now. It’s not flashy by any means, but for everyday use, it gets the job done.The battery life is the best I've got to say. It's the main reason I bought it. The 2-day battery holds up, and I don't often find myself connecting it to a charger. Even with moderate usage, like whether you are scrolling, texting, or doing some light gaming, it lasts the entire day and beyond.\xa0The 50MP camera is decent. In good lighting, photos come out satisfactory, but it struggles a bit in low light. I personally edit the photos later using the adjusting tool in the camera app; it makes it reasonably sharp and clear. The camera app is easy to use.\xa0The stylus is also a cool feature that I didn’t think I’d use much, but it’s actually handy for quick notes and drawing.Let's talk performance. It’s good for the price. It handles most tasks without too much lag. There are occasional slowdowns when switching between apps simultaneously when you are on a call; it becomes annoying, but it's not much of a deal breaker.The phone’s build is nice and big, and the color looks great. It feels comfortable in the hand, although it's a bit on the larger and heavier side. It becomes a little tricky when I don't have pants with bigger pockets. So keep that in mind if you prefer more compact phones.Overall, if you’re looking for a budget friendly phone that has reasonable performance, a good battery, and a few extra features like the stylus, the Moto G Stylus is a good choice. For $140, it’s hard to beat in this segment, but don’t expect it to perform like a high end phone. It’s good value for what you pay!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'VinnyD', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I  always use a motorola phone.

Battery lasted well, speaker and camera were decent, and had some nice software features.The phone was great, for the first month, until I started to notice particular issues with it. It doesn\'t maintain a WiFi connection. It\'ll say that it\'s connected, but then pages won\'t load and it\'ll endlessly be buffering until I turned the WiFi off and suddenly it was a fast as lightning. I own numerous devices that connected to the same WiFi with absolutely no issues, and I even tried using different WiFi hotspots, but always had the same issue. I even tried configuring the phone settings to see if that would help, but it never did.What really bothered me about this phone though, was the fact that after a certain period of time after it was on (I\'m not sure exactly how long, but definitely less than 24 hours) suddenly the actual PHONE part of this ""smartphone"" would stop working. It would still be able to use data, and I was able to send /receive messages via social media, but I wouldn\'t be able to make/receive phone calls or texts. I\'d suddenly get a voicemail, while using my phone, stating that I missed a call when it didn\'t ring. And if I tried to make a call, the call would immediately end without ringing. The only way I figured out to resolve this (even after searching Google for more ways to configure the settings), was to restart the phone.Which brings me to my third issue. A small percentage of the time, it would restart in a normal, timely manner (1-2 minutes), but most of the time it would freeze on the startup screen for at least 5 minutes before finally loading in. Sometimes, if I held the power button and manually turned it off and back on, it would fix it, but not usually.My fourth issue, was that sometimes if I plugged it into the charger, it would suddenly restart. It didn\'t seem like too much of a big deal at the time, until one of the times that it happened, it froze ENTIRELY on the startup screen. I tried doing what I did previously to hopefully get it to start again, but it continued to freeze. After searching online for answers and trying to troubleshoot it, the only answer I was able to find... Was to manually factory reset it. I would have considered bringing it it somewhere to be looked at by a professional, but I didn\'t have the time or the money for that, especially since I was not at home and needed the phone ASAP. Doing this was an absolute last resort for me and I was devastated.Finally, what brought about the death of this phone, was that it\'s definitely not waterproof. I\'ll admit that this was entirely my fault, but I\'d like to mention this as a warning to those who are used to nearly indestructible water resistant phones (like the Samsung Galaxy series). It happened to be on the sink counter beside me while I was brushing my teeth and I accidentally knocked it into the water stream. The charging port ended up frying and it no longer charges. Being that I had so many issues with it though, I\'m thankful to have a reason to move on.Also, I\'d like to mention that if you\'re used to responsive pressure sensitive styluses (like the Galaxy Note series), the stylus for this phone is nothing like that. It\'s exactly like a stylus you\'d buy from the dollar store, except it looks nice and fits inside the phone.Another thing I\'d like to note, is that this phone is very heavy compared to other phones and kind of bulky. I like to use PopSockets, and I never had issues with them before, but while using this phone I had to replace the base about once a month because it would just start peeling off, due to the weight. I ended up having to super glue it to my phone case, which resolved the issue. It also hurt my hand quite a bit while holding it for any length of time.Despite all of these things, it did have numerous features that I liked, but they were software related, so I imagine they would probably be available on most Motorola phones. The battery also lasted a decent amount of time as well, about a day and a half as long as I didn\'t do too much gaming. The speaker was also nice and loud, but a little tinny at times. The camera was decent too, and I was able to take some nice pictures with it.The cons definitely outweigh any positives in my opinion. What the point of a smart phone if it doesn\'t perform as a phone?\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazing and really effective for detox!

I saw it was shipped on the 25th. On the 30th, I received an SMS from DHL saying they planned delivery on Oct. 3rd, but on the same day I got an email asking for copy of national ID and content description for clearing customs. I am not a Morocco residents nor citizen, so I sent my foreign passport instead. On the 3rd, Amazon tracking info said clearing custom was delayed as additional documents were needed. So I called DHL, and the rep said it would be delivered on the 4th instead. On the 4th, I saw a newly posted message about delay on Amazon tracking. I called DHL various times but couldn\'t get to anyone. I then sent an inquiry by email and get a response shortly saying it was being taking care of. Then late afternoon, I got the package.Upon arriving, the seal of the packing had an opening large enough to put in a hand but not for getting the phone out, so I didn\'t complain.Unpacked, the inner packing of the phone was in excellent condition, very much like the original packing but had no Samsung marking, rather, it had a marking of ""amazonrenewed"". There was a film covering the screen, like on a new phone. The phone appeared in excellent condition, only had a small scratch at the back when I looked in detail, and a hair of scratch on the screen that is only visible under bright light and in a particular angle. I tried but couldn\'t turn on the phone - there was no response. The box also included a USB-C cable and a cheap non-Samsung charger made in China. I used my own Samsung Charger to charge the phone. After plugged in, it showed the battery was at 0. So I let it charge to full.After started, it turned out fully unlocked. My Morocco sim card works with 4G. The phone\'s software looked already reset, but I reset it myself anyhow. Then updated to the latest system with Android 12, and loaded many apps I need. During about the first week, the battery appeared quite poor. With medium usage it lasted about a day. I tried all necessary settings to conserve battery, but it didn\'t seem to help much. These couple days, it becomes much better, lasting about 45 hours. I read it was likely due to some AI processes either from Android 12 or Samsung doing the learning work at first.\xa0 But it\'s pretty bad the phone doesn\'t show any info.I would say I am very happy with the phone. And this is after having a terrible experience in the past with Samsung.The last Samsung phone I had was S7 Edge bought in Thailand (I am a traveler), new at a Samsung store for perhaps ~$800. I actually wanted the normal S7 (without the ""edge""), but it was out of stock then. I never liked the ""edge"", it was a silly design in my mind. The phone worked well initially, but in the coming couple of years I had a terrible experience. About 5 months later when I was in Vietnam, the screen started to show shaded bands across. As I was wondering how or if I should return to Thailand to get the phone serviced, the bands disappeared after a month. Then about another 7 months later when I was in Azerbaijan, the phone couldn\'t start after I did a system update. So I couldn\'t use the phone for a couple weeks until I reached Tbilisi in Georgia\xa0 when I had someone flashed it.\xa0 About a year later, it died on me again when I was in Morocco. I had someone re-flashed it, but it was not successful.\xa0 About 1 month later I reached the city of Fes where there is a Samsung service center.\xa0 After checking, they said there was something wrong with the motherboard. Very shocking!\xa0 I\'ve never had such problem in my life with all the phones and computers, cheap or dear, and this was a flagship!\xa0 So eventually, I sold it to a local repair shop for $200, for which they said they only needed the screen. That was end of 2017.So I never bought a Samsung again, and would definitely not buy one at the full price. I admit the S series is not worthless.\xa0 At least, I like the camera.\xa0 But I never had a chance to buy one at a largely reduced price (I won\'t buy from just any second-hand sellers).So now, the Amazon reviewed phone with some warranty got me interested. Yes, I have some risk, but to me with the past experience, the risk is not much higher than getting a new phone from Samsung, plus, I am putting in a much lower bet now.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jeff P', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Phone was is great condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Ordered this phone from Amazon around 5pm on Friday, and arrived at 8:00am the following day.

They  ended up being very very  helping in tracking down the seller as I always try to find a solution with them first before I call Amazon.  So, moving forward, basically I received what would be  at best, a fair to acceptable device . It has pits and grooves all along the bezels , a huge scratch on the back from the middle to the edge of the device. The screen was not great either , it came with a film type screen protector which I found strange as I purchase many devices and felt I should take it off to have a look and inspect. While the screen was not great it was also  not working properly via the amoled screen/digitizer recognizing fingerprints or gestures at times , maybe it was just the optical fingerprint sensor malfunctioning , actually I believe it’s digital sensor  on the s21 , regardless that’s nor here or there, the lint is , it didn’t work and was buggy  when touching all around NOT due to the OS (updated it to android 13 UI 5.1 it came on 11) (operating system ) but the hardware. Not being updates is not big deal as I prefer the option so that was done right at least.  However, I wish I had taken a picture of the back of the device as admittedly at this point I was disappointed and in the moment of “wth” moment because it took me 30 minutes to clean the device properly peel the stickers off and glue all over to truly inspect the device which I already knew it was going back as it’s not excellent and they will definitely get it back much cleaner than I received it but , again it device is beat up. They fact it wasnt even cleaned and  had sticker residue all over the the device as well or some sort of glue, was the first big indicator. They did not replaces the battery as well and it was not refurbished, I work in IT and other areas of tech like OSINT , basically hardware and software areas , not only by Amazon’s standards but in general, it’s common knowledge and states when purchasing , a “excellent “ condition device should have 90% battery health or above , this device had 74% battery health below 80% is unacceptable even for the cheapest condition you can buy as you’ll need a battery replacement within the 1st 6 months most likely sooner .  It gets worse as I contacted chubbiestech and got zero help or care for that matter ,  they said call Amazon it’s on them for the most part. I am making that short as ot was jet her a automated reply or a very I dont care approach on customer service.  I also reached out a second time to make them aware that about the battery percent being at 74% for the next person as a professional courtesy to get a  copy and pasted same response. So , very contradictory when if it’s sold by then and refurbed by them but are telling me it was handled by Amazon. I have the screenshots of the lack of concern or help and it’s just disappointing. As of now as I feel this brings up a issue that is indicative of the way things are now which is , the whole situation is a mess, as I made the return properly , bought insurance and did things accordingly , SO come to find out as of today the 18th of November, UPS has lost the package , Amazon can’t process my refund manually for another 2 weeks until the ticket expires , which is outrageous as this should not  be on me , my responsibility is done in the matter,  it’s was returned and I paid extra for insurance to make sure it’s safe, and I am eating the cost due to bad business practices on chubbieatech part as I am a small business myself, and I hate to say this but time is money , this will cost me in the end regardless of what happens , all due to not getting what I paid for from the start , I am in shock that in this day & age finding proper solutions and proper business practices has become so hard. If I would have gotten the excellent condition device that I had no problem paying for and they had no problem taking the money , I shouldn’t be without a device and up the creek as no one wants to step in and take accountability. I’m sorry , sellers like this that slip through the cracks and shouldn’t be in the platform, Amazon is not eBay. Now it’s my headache and it is very frustrating. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay clear from this one because if your device is not  not up to par, good luck as you will not get help , I’m a week in and I’m out of money spent and a device . I should also mention the charging port had a lip around the oval port indicating it’s been dropped , which is fine however replace the parts and check the device , make sure it works and indeed in excellent REFURBISHED condition. Nothing on this device was cleaned or fixed and was a poor device . I truly hope Amazon doesn’t sensor my review , which I have a feeling they will because this is the real life experiences that occur when you don’t get what you pay for and trust the Amazon name and sellers under them , and here I am with no device or refund of my money. It’s not ok , there is no A-Z guarantee here . Everyone has passed the buck. This is a HONEST review along with the consequences of poor business practices I think people should know about if you chose to buy from here and should not be censored.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'AmazonCustomer2013', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very good, but not excellent condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone came nicely packaged in an Amazon renewed box with a usb C cable, non OEM charger and sim removal tool.

It allows my child to make and receive phone calls, as well as to do basic texts. A simple call to T-Mobile customer service on her prepaid Sim card plan allowed me to shut the data off. It does have Wi-Fi so if your goal is to eliminate social media, you’re going to have to block this device on your router. I have Comcast and it allows me to Restrict Wi-Fi access based upon each device attached to the network. Don’t underestimate your child’s ability to find other Wi-Fi sources, but the operating system on this phone render it relatively useless. The phone can still access the Internet through an installed browser in the operating system, but it’s fairly rudimentary and , I suspect that it in effect eliminates the desire for social media since it’s so difficult to type out a sentence on a numeric keypad. So my recommendation is 1) buy this flip phone 2) get a T-Mobile, prepaid Sim card and pair it to your child’s cell phone number after you’ve ported the number to T-Mobile 3) select the $10 a month prepaid plan 4) call T-Mobile customer service and ask them to shut off the data on that phone number. They will give you our time and tell you that that isn’t an option, but it is an option and you just need to continue to insist on it and speak to a supervisor if they aren’t willing or able to do what you’re asking.  5) finally, block, access to Wi-Fi on your router for this device.

KaiOS is a stripped down version of Android running on a little processor that isn\'t capable of keeping up with the demands of Android bloat.  For example, open the phone, and in big numerals it will show you the time _that you last opened the phone_.  It may take up to a minute to update and show the actual time.  (You can train yourself you read the actual time on the tiny status bar.)  Sending a text message?  Type slowly because it won\'t keep up.(And good luck finding basic punctuation marks like the apostrophe or capitalizing a name in the middle of a sentence.  And your preferences for which text typing mode you like are constantly being reset to bad defaults.)The UI is unnecessarily cumbersome.  If you receive a spam text (aren\'t they all?), you\'re going to have to press a lot of buttons several times to delete it.I don\'t have a data plan because all I need is the occasional call and even rarer SMS message.

And, sometimes, that leaves key apps, like your contact list, inaccessible.The beauty of Type C USB connectors is that you can insert them either way.  However, if your charger and cable support PD (Power Delivery) and/or QC (Quick Charge), the phone will charge only when the cable is plugged in the ""right"" way.  If you leave it overnight on a charger with the cable the wrong way around, you\'ll wake up to a dead battery.  From what I\'ve read, you have to go out of your way to design a Type C USB port that isn\'t symmetric.  But why would you do that?  (And the battery life is terrible compared to previous feature phones I\'ve had.  Putting Android under the hood may have been an expedient way to create KaiOS, but you can\'t throw that at a low power processor and expect it not to burn through the battery.)Oh, I almost forgot about Bluetooth.  This phone fails to pair with my car.  My car thinks the pairing is successful, but the phone does not.  This phone does pair with my wife\'s car, but not mine.  Every other phone I\'ve used was able to pair with both cars.I don\'t have a great need for a cell phone (coverage at home is spotty at best), so I haven\'t gone looking for an alternative.  Yesterday, however, the phone died, a just few days short of 10 months of very light usage.  Outer screen won\'t light up.  Inner screen is filled with random pixel values.  If I call it, it doesn\'t even ring, so it\'s not _just_ a display failure.This device doesn\'t reach even the most minimal requirements of a cell phone.  If Nokia still cared one iota about its brand name, it never would have authorized this disaster.  It\'s actually worse that the Kazuna eTalk, which I wouldn\'t have imagined was possible.  This is not fit to be called a phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Flip phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Purchased as a gift.

I'm talking about quality wise. The old ones I had were built like tanks but it seems like none of the companies want to sink that effort into the new ones. I guess this one is close.It runs on KaiOS so you do get a few more app type options which I really didn't care about. If I still wanted apps, I would've stuck with my smart phone. Apps on this thing are just mobile Firefox web pages and they're flaky, don't work well with scrolling or clicking so don't expect much.Even email isn't going to impress anybody on KaiOS. You might as well only set up one account cause that's all you can use at one time anyway. If you want notifications from a different email account, you have to physically switch over to that account. Luckily, again, I wasn't looking for email features.Texting is the painful T-9 again which, due to the addition of all phones using the number 1 for voicemail, throws all the letters off by one, so any old muscle memory training you had from years ago is going to get screwed up. You have to retrain yourself on T-9 again. Fortunately, this phone has nice big keys so it has been easier than a couple of other flip phones I've tried. BUT, the biggest bonus with this phone as for texting has to be the voice input, which is actually fairly decent. I was impressed with how accurate and easy, easier than using the T-9 input, to enter quick texts. I'd recommend trying and using that feature as it will save you lots of grief trying to type.Ultimately, it's still a quality thing for me and this phone doesn't quite meet the same standards as my old flip phones. It's noticeably very plastic and also quite slippery in the hand. I'd strongly recommend getting the textured form fitting case at the same time or chances are good the thing is going to slide out of your hand.The battery length is probably it's best feature as it lasts a good 2-3 days depending on use. I never have to worry about charging it in the car as I can throw it on the charger at home for an hour or two and it's full again and ready for another couple of days.The blue color I ordered does not look like the pictures at all. It's more of a turquoise blue-green which I can't stand. I would've ordered the red had I known but I don't know if that would've looked like the pics or been more orange-red so unless you can physically see one, it's a gamble. Thankfully I ordered the textured case in black so it pretty much covers all of the ugly color of the phone anyway.I had been using the Nokia 8810 banana phone prior to this one and thankfully, the 2760 has far more processing power so you can actually do stuff without totally bogging the thing down like I found on the 8810.There is some bugs with the use of an sd card as well. I got mine all ready from my computer, and while the phone can see it and browse the files, it can't find any music files so I also can't change any ring tones. People on forums have said they have had some luck formatting the card on the phone itself but still run into problems when they try to hook the card back up to their PC to add music, etc. as the computer wants to reformat it again so it's a viscous circle. I didn't care enough about ring tones and music to bother fighting with this so I just left it as is for now.Overall, if you are looking for a modern flip phone that is somewhat close to old school quality and don't care about apps or anything other than having something for making calls and short texts, this is about the best I've found for a reasonable price. If Nokia, or some company, would offer a updated version of almost any old flip phone as far as build quality, I really think they would have a good size market of users who are wanting to get rid of a lot of their tech and go old school like me.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Néstor', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on February 1, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Mi papá está contento\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Aldo Manuel', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 31, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Falló a las tres semanas.Buena calidad en las llamadas, buena calidad de construcción, pero no tanto en los materiales.

This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused).I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences):1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this.2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with).3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed).4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine.5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired.6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app).7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it.I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review.OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come! A great buy overall!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Terra sillings', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Better than I thought', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I was very nervous about ordering a phone from Amazon.

I have always bought my phones refurbished and unlocked from Amazon and have never had any issues. The model of the phone itself is awesome and the camera is perfect.

It also came to me looking brand new and in excellent condition.The phone seemed to work flawlessly for the first month and half that I had it. I had no issues at all and then one day it just stopped connecting to my network carrier. It worked completely fine until I would leave anywhere that I had wifi and then I would not be able to use my phone as a phone. I wasn\'t able to send or receive calls or do anything that required internet unless I was connected to wifi. Including google maps when I was trying to navigate somewhere. I tried troubleshooting a bunch of different ways including removing my SIM card and putting it back in, and I spent over an hour on the phone with AT&T who told me to clear my cache in my internet browser which seemed to work for about an hour then it would tell me ""No network coverage available"" anytime I tried to do anything. It wasn\'t my carriers issue because everyone else on my plan had zero coverage issues. I went back and read more of the negative reviews on here and realized I wasn\'t alone with this issue. Like I said, I\'d never had any problems like this before with buying refurbished phones on Amazon. I don\'t know if this seller is bad, or the device itself just had some computing issues.When I requested an exchange for my phone I was told that they didn\'t have any more available and that I would have to receive a refund only available on the card that I used to purchase it. I ended up just going to AT&T and buying the new Galaxy S24 Ultra and I LOVE it.

I still have an iPhone 8 Plus that is awesome.  Also part of the equation is security updates.  Frequent, regular, like clockwork, security updates.With iPhone this is standard.  With android phone makers, it\'s hit and miss, mostly miss.  Samsung does update their flagship frequently... for a time.  But Samsung wants $1200 for their flagship.  No thanks.Pixel?  I heard Google provides regular, systematic updates.  Their phones don\'t cost $1000.  Saw some good things said about the Pixel, thought I\'d try the Pixel 4a 5G and see if I liked it.

The Pixel 4a 5G is minimalist, light, leaves you ""uninvolved"" or slightly detached from the massive Google ecosphere, unless you go in and configure the various bits and pieces of it.I\'m very pleased with my purchase.  Refreshing alternative to Samsung.  Don\'t get me wrong, Samsung flagship is a beast.  But I never buy new $1000 plus phones.  So the best that I could do is buy a used or NOS Samsung Note, which I did (a Note 9), and it was a terrible experience.  Old android version, build quality was not too hot.  If you ever look at buying a flagship phone that is 2 or 3 versons behind, Samsung can\'t cut it.  Apple is much better in that scenario.

Six days ago, I was walking through my neighborhood with my nine-month-old Google Pixel 4A 5G in my front right pants pocket.  The Pixel was encased in a Spigen Tough Armor case and was equipped with a tempered glass screen protector.  Due to an unfortunate encounter with a dog, I tripped and fell - on my back, mind you.  I was fortunately not hurt (although to this day I hope that worthless dog gets struck by lightning), but when I pulled my Pixel out of my pocket to exchange phone numbers with the dog\'s owner, I discovered the damage you see in the attached pictures.  The phone display showed what I can only describe as a ""green screen of death.""  From that moment to now, the phone has been totally unusable.  The front screen is destroyed, the headphone jack is destroyed, and the back cover has partially separated from the front of the phone.  And all this from a drop of about 33 inches.  (I\'m not a tall guy!)  A drop that occurred while the phone was not only in its protective case, but was still in my pocket!Which leads to two philosophical questions.  First, if a phone has impressive capabilities, yet is too fragile to take with you on a walk, what good is it?  I don\'t play video games, nor do I watch movies on smartphones.  And if I want to take pictures, there are plenty of good cameras that I can buy.  My Pixel\'s capabilities are worthless to me now, and I am out $500 dollars for a phone that\'s turned into a piece of junk.Second, what\'s with the obsession that manufacturers and sellers of certain things have with weight and size?  We\'re constantly being bombarded with marketing that says that we should buy the lightest, thinnest versions of certain very expensive things - as if the presence of even two or three extra grams will pin us to the ground.  It\'s not like we\'re competing in the summer Olympics!  I am thinking right now of the Greek myth of Sisyphus being punished eternally by being forced to roll a large boulder up a hill only to have the boulder slip out of his hands just before he gets to the hilltop.  And I can imagine someone coming to him and saying, ""Dude - the reason you can\'t roll that rock over the hill is because of the smartphone you\'re carrying!  It adds weight and slows you down!  You should buy one of our phones, because they don\'t weigh anything more than air!""  Thin + light does not always equal ""cutting-edge quality.""

The night mode is also good. the ultra wide is not exactly ultra wide as you see on other phones but it does take some good ultra wide photos and you also get the unlimited backup on this pixel. This feature is not available for pixel 5 and above devices. So this pixel 4a 5g is the last device to have this.The battery is okish, it can get you through the day. I use this as a secondary device so I can get easily 2 days with it.The display is very good but if you come from using a QuadHD+ display then you might notice some subtle difference. the touch responsiveness is also very good. Always on display is nice to have.It comes with 5g so its future proof. I got this shipped with android 11 but got the update for android 13 right after I turned it on.( android 13 launched just a few days ago). In terms of latest updates you will get all latest updates ahead of any other manufacturer.The ram management is okish but it can suffice daily usage requirements. This phone is not for high performance. I am yet to install pubg on this and test it on that angle.the phone comes with a 18W type charger and cable included but the pin is not the indian pin, it is the standard western pin. but its good to see a charging brick in the box these days. the charging speed is not damn good, its okish. It takes 1.5hrs something to charge to 100%I would recommend you to not update the software on this phone and go with the software it comes out of the box. The more you update, the sh*ttier the phone gets later on (speaking from personal experience from android phones).After 3 months :So I’ve updated the phone and it is working really good(that is something I’ve never expected from an android). The charging time is too much if you use it moderately.Multi tasking is a nightmare and this phone can’t handle heavy gaming as well. I tried pubg in lowest settings and high frame rate. It lags but it can manage. I am looking to buy a more watt power brick for this may be a 65W brick as I’m not used to wait for so long to charge the phone. I used one plus and iPhones before so they charge so much faster and this charges so slow even with 18W charger.\nRead more'}]",,B08H8VZ6PV,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08H8VZ6PV,5g

My phone had not been abused or subjected to moisture in any way shape or form, so 4 months of cellphone service for $240 feels suboptimal, when paying slightly more for a whole year of coverage would be much less so.I\'m now tasked with ""repairing"" a phone i\'ve owned for less than 4 months and now need to repair or replace at my expense.

The USB 3 cable came with my SanDisk extreme 1 tig water resistant solid state drive from Costco, which pairs perfectly to these. I paid around 180 each  for the prior phones but the trackfone $45 offer is awesome.

YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!- materials make it feel premium!

I loved my 4a, but the battery was draining pretty fast, so decided to upgrade when a good sale came along. I was hesitant about the front facing fingerprint scanner, since my husband's been having issues with his 6A. But I assumed that Google would have made the necessary improvements to make it better. They did not. My 4a had the fingerprint scanner on the back. It worked like a dream. Every single time. I've had this 7A for about a month. Getting the scanner to recognize my fingerprint has been a struggle, the entire time. You can scan in four fingerprints. I even tried scanning in the same fingerprint in the settings in all four slots. It helped somewhat. It still fails most of the time. The face scanner works decent unless you have sunglasses on or it's dark out. Which means that a good chunk at the time I end up having to put my pin number in because I time out on the fingerprint scanner. Google either needs to fix it, or go back to the rear facing fingerprint scanner. All that said, it's a great phone otherwise.Pros:The camera is absolutely amazing!All the expected quality and perks and operations of a Google pixel.Cons:It's bigger and heavier than my 4a.The fingerprint scanner is a joke.

I cracked the heck out of my Samsung Galaxy S21 ultra's screen beyond simple repair and needed something cheap to hold me over until the next phone is released.Honestly, if you've never experienced a high end smartphone you'll probably love this one. The battery life is great, I'm okay if I miss a days of charging my phone. Screen size is great at 6.5 inches, pretty light weight too. It's up to date as far as Android software... The camera takes acceptable shots in light and darker areas for the price range of the phone no big bells or whistles though. Expandable memory! Gotta love phones that still have an microsd slot. Headphone jack? Yep it has that too. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner. So far it has been 100% and zippy quick. Overall, It does what a normal midrange phone should do!On a negative side though, there's a good delay when switching between heavy apps. It's not frustratingly annoying but definitely noticeable. The sound quality isnt the best, even at maximum levels, it's just okay. Colors are not vibrant or vivid, just good... You won't get that crisp 4k imagery when watching videos or viewing high def pictures obviously. Vibrations isn't super strong, no 5g, just as bunch of minor things that can be overlooked. Space could be an issue, 32 gigs is pretty stingey, but that's what the expandable memory is for. It's a good phone for the price.Would I recommend?

Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. It's not as fast as back fingerprint readers but I can't blame oneplus as android a whole has moved towards using in-display finger readers. Also if your thumb is slightly wet then it likely won't read your fingerprint.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'antonio', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'great phone, great display, very fast, highly recommend', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2021', 'Review Body': ""very solid phone, works on cricket as you would expect considering cricket is running on at&t towers being a subsidiary i.e. owned by at&t. it has a really great camera in my opinion, and yes it comes with 65w fast charger out of the box a nice touch(samsung eat your heart out, or rip it out coz you don't do that) coming from being an iPhone user for many years, i do really like this phone. it's fast and so far no issues at all the display is great much better than the 60 hz found on iPhone (iPhone needs to step up their game) really not much else to say here, i do wish android would not have so many services that you cant remove without rooting. but most can be overlooked for now by disabling them. only down side to the switch is listed below i don't like getting notifications for everything by default i hope android changes this in the future to only display notifications for messages and calls it is a bit annoying having the phone buzz off for things you could care less about and as i stated below it's tedious to have to go into settings and shut off notifications for over 40 apps but is a fault of the android operating system itself. it does have some of what i consider bloatware but most can be uninstalled and some like the unwanted google stuff can only be disabled would like to see that change like google play movies/music and google photos stick them with a pipe just disable and get yourself vlc player and you are good to go.some things i don't like are just having to shut off notifications on a large amount of apps but that's all android based phones not a huge issue but annoying and time consuming and also shutting off permissions to apps that you don't want having access to camera, contact, microphone, LOCATION and other things you may not want some apps or services having access too but again all androids have this issue\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'L. Dah', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Replacing a failing Pixel 3XL, this has done the job quite well, but...there are some quibbles.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2021', 'Review Body': ""Full disclosure I enjoy the more pure Android eco-system. Having read about One Plus Oxygen being an open source port of Android that gets pretty good reviews I decided to go for the One Plus 9 5G. My carrier is Google Fi, and I was so disappointed they started selling Samsung phones, of which I'm not a fan at all.First thing I noticed after purchasing it was the fit and finish is quite nice. It's not a brick, not svelte per se, but it has a good weight to it. The width was a welcome change from the Pixel 3XL. That minor reduction in width made this much more capable as a single hand phone. I'm not one to really care about fingerprints but you will get fingerprints all over the back and the face...again, whatevs.The speed. Out of the gate, when I dropped my Google Fi sim into the device the first thing I noticed was the speed. This is a fast tight phone. Which I do appreciate. Especially since my Pixel was on it's last legs and I really did need a replacement that would be a decent upgrade.If you purchase the unlocked version you should be aware of a few settings so your coverage is taking advantage of both WiFi calling/data, and roaming. Which sort of leads me to believe that since you have to make those adjustments in the settings menu. I wonder how many people have purchased the phone and thought, damn my coverage is awful with this thing.  So, I ding them for that....but then, this isn't a on and done purchase. You have to do a bit of finagling with the hardware. Welcome to Android....lol.Charging. WOW...just WOW. I have a 15w wireless charger I used with my Pixel and it charges the One Plus 9 5G...just fine....and...not sure I get why people complain about the wireless charging but in my experience it's just fine. At work I charge it connected to a docking station and.....it's FAST. And that's using my Pixel charging cable.Battery life. I don't think this is intended as a battery sipper. it will go through a full charge in a day. With some room to spare. But overall I wasn't dismayed by the battery life. I've tested it with the various and NUMEROUS battery life extension settings on the phone, some of which are confusing...again...welcome to Android. But I like playing around with stuff like this;Camera. Love it. It's great. I've literally taken shots with my Pixel that I regard as stunning. And in the few weeks I've had the One Plus 9 5G, can't complain at all. If anything, I've noticed a depth of color in both wide  and closer shots that feels more realistic and to be honest I'm kind of shocked at how well the camera works compared to the Pixel 3XL, which...I really loved that camera, a lot. The interface is quite different but it's responsive and the level of tweeking you can do to get your shot is miles apart from the Pixel.What's not so great: Well, on the second week I scratched the screen, Just above the fingerprint sensor. I had it in my pocket with some keys, my bad, and I was kind of surprised it scratched so easily. I've had my Pixel for over 3 years, handling the exact same way and I never experienced that. The screen never had any wear at all. The scratch isn't bad, you can only see it if you look at it at an angle. But still. This concerns me.Fingerprint sensor: hit or miss. It's built into the front of the screen, which is nice. But, it takes multiple tries to unlock, and if your fingers are particularly dry, or just off from the sensor. Yes, you'll get a warning and have to enter your pin after so many tries. To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. But it has been an annoyance a few times.Choices!: There's a LOT to play with in the settings, for me not a big deal at all, for others....gives me pause. Not sure I'd recommend this phone to someone not into having fun with the settings. Or a person that just wants to turn it on a go.File transfers to Mac: It'd be nice if I could connect the phone to my mac to transfer files. The phone automatically offers a USB driver to install when you connect it to a PC. Not so much with a Mac. There was an article on the One Plus website about enabling developer mode so you could enable USB logging so you could do file transfers....tried it, didn't work. Not a deal breaker but.....again, not the most user friendly experience.Conclusion: I like the phone, and I think it'll serve me for what I need it to do. Speed, durability and camera. 5G coverage where I'm at is, spotty, but, have noticed a speed boost when it does show up in the top menu bar...which again...wow, LOADS of icons in the top home screen menu bar...it's kinda funny. And Camera, I used my camera phone on my Pixel all the time. If this phone's camera was lackluster or a compromise I would have sent it back fast.  But from what I've experienced, especially the camera interface, I have a lot to play with and for that I'm excited.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alexandra Racine', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on October 12, 2023', 'Review Body': ""Pour un Oneplus 9 neuf à 440 $ , le rapport qualité-prix est excellent.Il est rapide et j'aime la détection du visage.

I taught myself a lesson: don\'t take minimal passes as success. The first observations are still valid,  but sobered by experience. Getting to know this item I found it to be, in a word, CRAP for daily use. Oh let me count the ways. 1)Touch screen is irratic. It either doesn\'t react to a tap or goes off on its own if just brushed. No change no matter what I do in settings, so it\'s useless for browsing. 2) Phone drags to connect to Internet, change pages, etc. Maddening to try to read news or an article. NOT just ""relatively"" slow. 3) Battery life is a joke!! While it charges well and holds charge if left alone, JUST DON\'T USE IT! In even browsing it east charge. Will go from 100 to 80% in less than an hour. And once it gets down to 40% you\'re toast. Not what I need for even ""go phone"" use. I\'m keeping it as an in the drawer, purely last resort bandaid in case disaster strikes with everything else. Have a different small phone coming that will go through a full check list and stay if it really passes. If not it goes back - don\'t need another drawer phone.First review below:Okay, it\'s a model a few years old, still runs android 10, lacks built-in widgets, and is relatively slow. BUT, it\'s exactly what I needed as a second ""go phone"" rather than my main line. AND it is an unlocked smart phone that really is unlocked and accommodates a reseller network (Consumer Cellular). Setup was a snap: inserted my new SIM and logged in with my Google account. The phone and Consumer Cellular did the rest including importing my contacts. I just had to disable a few pre-installed, and a couple of must haves out of Google Play, and done. As George Carlin would say, a smaller portable place for my stuff.

Had previously used LG phones and had missed the sim card and audio Aux out. Was interested to see that this had both, as well as a stylus.Got it for $250 on Prime Day and my biggest fear going from a Snapdragon 8 gen 1 to a 6 gen 1 was performance. I've been more than pleasantly surprised. In fact, when using Spotify and other apps that require a fast scan down the page I've actually found it faster. Was also happy to see just how sharp the red version looks. I put it under a clear case and love the way it looks.The camera app is certainly a weak point as it really does give extra color to images, and can take a split second longer to take a photo than a premium S22/iPhone, but its fine for my limited use.The battery has been the star of the show. Minus the relatively slow charge vs OnePlus's 60W charging, it's been amazing. Getting two days of battery life has been insanely refreshing.In second place for my favorite design angles, only by tiny bit, is the screen, which seemed to have a better white balance than the OnePlus 10 Pro. It's beautiful. It's also been very crisp and responsive, with the touchscreen always hitting the exact spot I touch (an issue I had on the OnePlus).Overall, for $250 (!) or even $400, this is a tremendous value. I don't game or do much video processing, so I can't speak to that...but for me, minus the camera speed, this daily drives very close to the flagship phones of my past. Add to that an audio Aux jack and the ability to add additional SD storage and it's a no brainier for most non power users (IMO). If you're not a power user and are looking to save cash on a solid phone, I'd say go for it. So far (2 weeks in), I couldn't be happier with my choice.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Paulian Moscovici', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Reliable and user friendly', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent phone for everyday usage.

Requires a good manual, though.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Just got this phone on 9/22/2024. Still checking it out.The first thing I noticed is that this phone came with very little instruction, which was a disappointment. However, I found an online manual on the Motorola website and I accidentally found another manual in PDF format on the Internet with the name ""moto g stylus 5G.NA Retail.UG.en-US.SSC8D23433-A.pdf.""You can do a Google search and download this manual for yourself. After doing a search for the PDF file mentioned above, you will find a listing named ""moto g stylus 5G User Guide"". That\'s it. You should study this manual and also understand that there are some differences between the information in the manual and the features of the phone. But the manual should help a lot.I experimented with photos because part of the reason I bought the phone is to take an important photo or do an important video if the need arose. I haven\'t spent much time on this yet, but I can tell you that I\'m somewhat disappointed, but not surprised, with the quality of photos. I just did some videos and I\'m still working on that, but videos can be done fairly well.You can plug this phone into your computer using a USB cable. It comes with a charging cable that has a C-size USB connection on both ends. This can be used with a USB wall charger, but they don\'t give you a USB cable for connecting to your computer, but I already had a USB cable for that.When you plug in your USB cable to connect to your computer, you will be asked what kind of USB connection you want. I choose ""Photo and Video Transfer"". Then you can use your phone like a disk drive. However, you should not try to play your videos directly from your phone. I suggest that you copy all the videos to a good fast drive on your computer and play them from there. I also advise that you should really use 60 frames per second for a smoother video.From what I can tell, a phone like this isn\'t really going to take the place of a good digital camera or a good camcorder, so don\'t expect to do that. But it does a fairly good job.The overall physical quality seems very good. The display is very sharp. The stylus works well and I use it most of the time because I have large fingers. Using a finger print as a security means works very well.The overall design of the software seems pretty good, but I urge you to download a manual for this phone because the overall complexity of the operating system.While charging the phone from my computer, I get a ""slow charge"" message. However, the phone will still charge from my computer. From a USB wall charger, I don\'t remember getting any slow charge message. You might consider that slow charging increases the life of most batteries, so maybe it\'s a good idea to charge from a computer, after all.I\'ll update this review after finding out more about this phone, if I remember to do so.9/24/2024: Had a chance to test photos and videos. I think the quality of both is surprisingly good. I\'muploading a test photo that I think turned out very good. View this first with a viewer that fits the file to your screen. Then zoom in to 100%. The picture is perfect both ways.

I stayed on the Note 9 for many years, and finally, when my provider could no longer replace my Note 9 under extended warranty, I was forced to look at another brand.Enter the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024!  Amazon was running a promotion on this brand new release from Motorola, and at $317.95 for a brand new unlocked Moto flagship, I was absolutely down for that.  I got so used to paying $1,300 to $1,500 for the latest Samsung flagship phone release, I almost forgot what bang for the buck value looked like! :)As I walked through the Specs of this phone, I couldn\'t help but feel like, wow, I\'ve been overpaying for a large screen and stylus forever....need to try something new.  And I wasn\'t dissapointed!  I had been considering the Pixel 8 Pro for several months, but I couldn\'t get one from my mobile provider, and I couldn\'t get a good deal for an unlocked version ($799 to $999) so I started looking at Motorola.Low and behold, their latest flagship Stylus 5G (just launched in May 2024) was on Promo :)  The big draw for me with both the Pixel and the Moto Stylus was that they were Google phones...literally.  Everything about them was Google centric.  And better yet, no bloatware or stupid useless skins over the Android experience.  Just pure Google/Android and great Apps.The new phone transfer process was seamless and super easy!  I just took my Sim Card out of my old handset, and threw it into the Moto G Stylus, and immediately Google\'s phone transfer process kicked in.  Step by step, device to device, in about 45 minutes I was done.  That\'s it, easy peezy.My initial few days with the new Moto, man, a $1,000 less in cost for very good performance, 120Hz refresh rate, Google centric Android experience, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of Flash Storage, Nice Aluminum stylus, good Apps for Notes, Art/Drawing, Editing, etc.  WiFi performance is excellent, Cellular reception is much better than my previous $1,400 Note 9, Bluetooth range is excellent, Camera is solid, with Pro features and capabilities if you wanna get all high end with your cameras, camera software is way better than the 2023 version, MP is up(50), camera quality is way up (software improvements), embedded storage is more than adequate for on device storage needs (256GB\'s is a lot of local storage, when you store everything to Google Drive), and the performance of the SnapDragon SOC, while not the latest and greatest, it powers through moderate gaming, is awesome for media consumption (streaming video) UI is super fluid, no jittery transitions, swipe is butter, couldn\'t be happier with the overall performance.It comes loaded with Android 14, it has an Audio Jack port! and it supports Micro SD card storage up to 2TB (although I haven\'t physically confirmed that) and Dolby ATMOS with two very capable speakers integrated for excellent sound performance.  The 6.7"" pOLED screen is outstanding, Refresh Rate is awesome (120Hz), SnapDragon 6 SOC is solid, all that and the all day 5,000mAh battery + rapid charging (35W wired, 15W wireless)  you\'ve got as complete a package as I\'ve ever seen.In short, I\'m done paying an arm and a leg for technology I don\'t really need.  Give me rock solid value every day.  The Moto G Stylus 2024 is just that, Maximum bang for the buck on every front, and I don\'t have to take out a 24 month loan to buy it!!!  I would highly recommend trying this handset out!8/29/24 Quick update for everyone on adding MSD storage to the phone. 2TB\'s is overkill for me because I use Google Drive for backup and Amazon Photo\'s as well, so I don\'t need ton\'s of onboard storage, but for the sake of checking out the Micro SD card capability, I dropped $35 on a 1TB SanDisk High Speed MSD, dropped it in, and instantly recognized as external (not embedded) storage, and the only choice you need to make is whether you want to format it such that you can move the card to any device as external storage, or leave it as phone dedicated storage and you\'re done.  Once again, seamless experience, no hassles, no incompatibility problems, nothing.  Plug and Play.  Having used the handset now for several weeks, it\'s more awesome than I originally thought.  It just does soooo much for so little cash, I\'m giving it a 10 out of 10.  Lesson learned, don\'t be a slave to specs.  This phone is boss, hands down the best stylus enabled large handset for the buck.  I can\'t wait to see the next gen of this handset......all smiles friends :) :) :)\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mike F.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone, nice screen', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Good phone for the price.Good:Price, smooth operation, great screen, strong speaker volume, has NFC, wireless charging, moto gestures (actually pretty useful, chop-chop motion to turn on the light, and twist to turn on the camera).

It's a genetic thing and I can't do much about it. I say this, because when I realized the battery in my 2021 Moto Stylus G is not staying charged, I needed to get a replacement that preferably had a nice camera with stabilizing ability. I almost got a high-end phone, but then I realized that almost none of them has expandable memory. I am not okay with that. I did some research on the latest Moto Stylus phone and I liked what I read. Now that, I've had a few days to test it out, I like it a lot. I'll lay out a few reasons. by the way, I took the two pictures above with the Moto Stylus 2021 and Moto Stylus 2024. I'll let you guess which picture is from which.#1 Camera -- my favorite feature of this phone is the camera. I don't know if the camera has a physical or software stabilizer, or both; to me it doesn't matter, because my pictures turn out so much better!#2 Speed -- I'm used to turning on my phone and waiting a bit for it to load up after a reset. This new stylus phone loads up really quickly and I'm surprised at how quickly I can use it.#3 -- The Stylus -- The stylus has a newer design to it. To me it feels more sturdy and easier to use than my old stylus#4 -- Software -- The software seems improved overall. I am enjoying all the minor tweaks that Android has made since version 11.#5A -- Finger sensor -- I'm not a fan of the change. The finger sensor is now on the screen. I like having the sensor on the back of the device. I realize they did this, to allow for wireless charging; so most will prefer this. Also, I don't really need the finger sensor anymore, because of facial unlocking; nevertheless, I still prefer the finger sensor to be on the back of the device.#5B -- Facial sensor -- A new feature for me, this works great; I have a beard, and the phone has no problem recognizing me.#6 -- Screen -- The LED screen on the old Moto, was pretty good; however, the OLED screen on the new phone is really nice.#7 -- I reused the SD card from my old device, however, it works well and I have no lag in performance using it. I also look forward to upgrading it in the future, should I run out of room... 2 TB is an insane amount of space.Pros:Excellent cameraProcessor and ram are fastStylus feels goodSoftware has good improvements over allThe new OLED screen is a good leap forwardCan hold up to 2 TB of add on storageCon:Finger sensor now on the screen instead of the back of the device.\nRead more""}]",28.653295128939828,B0D1ZFS9GH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D1ZFS9GH,5g

I love Android and I was really intrigued with the Google and Asus phones. I have had a galaxy since the beginning of smart phones it would seem. Well, looking at all options as well, the red iPhone caught my attention solely in color. I know IPhone is a good phone, for the most part, everyone I know seems to have iPhone or Galaxy. I have never owned an iPhone and they are much more expensive than the phones I was looking at. But the red iPhone, I just kept coming back to. I started looking into the differences, and then started looking into refurbished. I have also never purchased a refurbished phone. The price difference for a “Premium” or “excellent” condition iPhone, was significantly cheaper than buying brand new. I went back and forth on Amazon, with different sellers based on reviews, and ended up landing in the option where it is sold and shipped by Amazon themselves (which I thought was more likely to be exactly what is described in their product page). I will say the first try to purchase did not go through, so there were some issues with the monthly insurance plan for the phone. But the second time it did go through, and I was having to wait probably 4 days for it to get here. I was so excited, like a kid waiting for Christmas to get here.Finally the iPhone arrived, and in absolute perfect condition. I went with the “premium refurbished” option. The delivery was incredibly secure and the driver was extra helpful before they arrived so we could time it. I opened the box and there is not one scratch or thing that would tell you that this isn’t a brand new phone. It comes with a charger, block and the phone information on a leaflet (that would otherwise be in the original iPhone packaging). I did wait to activate it, until I had time to go into a physical carrier store, but I backed up everything before I did that in my old phone. It took maybe 5 minutes for the associate at my carrier store, to set the iPhone up and transfer everything I wanted from my galaxy and the service, to the iPhone. I was worried based on other reviews that it could possibly not be unlocked to all carriers, but it was. One of the main reasons I chose to buy the refurbished option from the sold by/ships by Amazon option, because I trusted the accuracy of the description more.ALL THAT SAID beautiful phone, looks brand new, works like it’s brand new, has 100% battery life out of the box and is very easy to get used to (even if you have had an android all your adult life). I definitely recommend this product and Amazon as the seller to ensure you get what you are looking for. I am SO happy with my purchase and when it comes time to get a new phone a few years from now, I will be starting here this time!

If you need the latest model with the most memory and fastest processor so you can impress your friends and family dog; this isn\'t for you.  For those of us who just want a mobile phone that can text, stream cat videos while you are in boring meetings, or play mindless games so you can distract yourself from what you are supposed to be doing, this is an inexpensive option.  It connects to wifi so you aren\'t burning minutes on your plan for things other than calls and texts  -if you have access to wifi and you set the phone to connect to wifi.  NOTE: The autocorrect keeps changing wifi to wife.  I suggest you don\'t set it to connect to your wife -unless you and your wife are into those kind of things.  No judgment.  I\'ve been avoiding cell phones for years, so I haven\'t kept track.  (Now I need a contract so I can confirm things with texts.  It\'s a conspiracy, man!!!)  I suspect this model was popular a few years ago.  Now it is out of fashion, but still entirely functional.  Combine it with a Tracphone $60.00 per year plan, and you are good to go for occasionally receiving/sending occasional texts, or having a means of contacting people when you aren\'t near your primary phone(s).  You can also disconnect in the middle of a diatribe, and then blame it on having an older model phone.  (I really miss ""hanging-up"", touching the disconnect icon just doesn\'t have the same closure.  Motorola needs to add a sound effect of a phone receiver slamming down when you disconnect.  Hmmm, now that I think of it, it may already exist.  Hmmm, if it doesn\'t exist, maybe I can copyright it.  Be right back, gonna check...  Dang! there are 103 sound effects to download.  I\'ll check them out later to see if there is a slamming phone receiver.  Don\'t steal my idea.)  WARNING: This is a ""locked"" phone.  That means that you must use a Tracphone contract.  If you buy this phone, don\'t complain that an ATT, T-Mobile, or Joe\'s Budget Cell Phone Plan with free fries, doesn\'t work. <shrug>  Sorry, I couldn\'t rate Battery Life or Tech Support.  I don\'t use it heavily, and I don\'t have it off the charger for days at a time.

For it's price, it is a great phone. Even though my previous phone still works great, it is 16 GB and I was running out of memory for apps.  I had to start removing apps as with each update of each app, they seemed to bloat taking up more and more memory.  That led me to needing a new phone with 32 GB of memory which led me to this phone.  Previously I always used LG Tracfones but I read LG is no longer making inexpensive Tracfones which is probably why they are no longer on Tracfone's website.  I always wondered how the Motorola phones were so when I saw this at a great price I bought it.  I have not connected it to Tracfone service yet as I want to have it setup to my liking before I do.  Even though it is still Android there are some differences with the Moto settings and its use of the features that make me prefer the LG phones but nothing that would make me not like it or want to use it.  My only complaint is no where on the Amazon listing for this phone did it say whether it is GSM or CDMA so I don't know whether Tracfone in my area will accept this phone.  The packing list said CDMA but according to Motorola's website it is GSM.  Then I read that Tracfone was bought by Verizon and as of November 2023 Tracfone plans will be changed.  There is some confusion whether Verizon is still CDMA or not.  So I don't know whether I will be able to use this phone after Verizon takes over.  Or whether I would stay with Verizon depending on their pricing policies for previous Tracfone customers.  But it is still a great phone so far.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gregory H.', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazingly good for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Ok, this is NOT an $800+ smart phone, so no one should be comparing it to one.  However, it wasn\'t that long ago that if you spend any less than $250 on a cheaper phone, it was absolute junk.  This (when on sale) is less than $50 and it\'s perfectly usable for many people.  The screen is decently bright and clear even though it\'s not ultra-high res.  You get a basic amount of RAM (3 gig) And storage (32 gig) but you can add a micro SD card to that and use any number of apps that keep junk files cleaned out, etc.  One speaker, but you can\'t expect stereo for this price; it\'s decently loud, though.The cameras are average but in good light the rear one does really well - in lower light, not so much, but if you tweak the pics in a decent photo app you can make them better.  The selfi cam is serviceable.  Video quality tops out at 1080p and is also average.  Tracfone can be hit or miss - they are NOT known for their customer service skills, but generally speaking the service works and there are few outages compared to some others.  If you have an older person who just wants a ""use at times"" phone or a kid who needs their first smart phone, this won\'t break the bank (just PLEASE read up on parental controls on Android before handing one over to a tween/teen!!).Once again - ""for the price"" I rate this phone highly.

There is a small amount of easily removable bloatware on this, but otherwise, it\'s a very affordable phone that comes with a stylus.Connectivity is very good, in the typical Lenovo/Motorola fashion. This is a great phone if gaming is not your thing and if you don\'t need quirks like foldable displays or cameras with ""Samsung 100x space zoom."" It\'s simple, reliable, and has a GREAT price.The screen is very responsive, videos work flawlessly, and the photos from the 3 cameras (1 front, 2 rear) are excellent.The mounting of the stylus (just like the 2021 and 2022 versions) leaves something to be desired, as it WILL fall out at some point. To prevent the loss of said stylus, get a GOOD case like an OtterBox or a DBrand for this phone, and order and keep spare stylus pens on you if you use them a lot (for signing documents and editing photos). I really wish that would be re-located to the top of the phone instead of being stuffed into the bottom, but for most users who don\'t use the stylus, that\'s a moot point.I\'ve had several Motorola phones since 2019 (when the LG Stylo was discontinued), and they\'ve all been good. This is yet another one I can recommend.My biggest concern is that this phone is NOT waterproof or even water resistant. My first one got fried by humidity and lake water, so I ordered a second one to replace it.

Motorola has focused on the essentials of what makes a smartphone good and have saved on what makes a phone a status symbol. Very responsive interface, no lag, no hiccups, fast stable wi-fi, good battery life, solid gps for navigation, and lots of internal storage and SD card slot.They had to cut somewhere to get the phone to $300 and that is evident in the ""feel"" and materials of the phone. It doesn\'t look cheap, but the body is plastic and the back does slightly vibrate when the speakers are turned up loud. It, however, does not effect the sound quality, which is decent. The lack of gorilla glass and limited amount of updates, might limit the lifespan of this phone, but in all honesty, most phones are replaced at least within 5 years due to software and technical advancements.You will have to spend some time removing bloatware, but once you have done that you have a nice clean UI.There are quite a few options at around this price range and I had a difficult time selecting a phone. What lead me to finally selecting the Moto G 5G stylus was its support for a large number of cellular bands around the world. If you are buying an unlocked phone, you want as many options for choosing a tel carrier at home or abroad.

The display is decent, speakers are loud, bluetooth works well including in my vehicle, NFC is always welcome for convenience.  Screen protectors are easy to acquire and install since the screen's flat, and cases are great for this phone.

I'm continually pleased more and more as I use it. Look, I don't delve deep into specs or drool over asthetics - I just want a phone that does what it's supposed to do. But it sure does look nice all the same. Add a Poetic case and it will feel solid in your hand and it will sit without wobble from the cameras. It's fast. The screen looks great. Speakers are rather loud with volume up but of course you aren't likely to play music using only the speakers, you'll stream it to some Bluetooth speakers or use ear buds. Android 14 is slick and easy to use. As always, Motorola adds only a few gesture options and a few moto specialty assists but you don't need to use them - you will, though! No added bloat, almost pure Android. The cameras are far better than the moto cams of old. I have no complaints. Charges ridiculously fast. Battery lasts 2 days or more normal use, I haven't drained it fully to see exactly how long but I'm very happy with the battery life. The power button below the volume is weird at first but it's easy to get used to. You can power off using the button on the screen near the settings icon so you rarely need the physical button anyway. You can also change the very odd default setting for power off using the power key and volume button same time, which is awkward. Just check the settings and switch it to power off with just the power button. I love a big phone so I'm happy with the size. And here's something unexpected that I really appreciate - the screen is smudge resistant and does a great job of keeping prints off it. The phone looks nice all the time, no greasy fingerprints for the most part. When you do notice it needs a wipe, a soft cloth and literally 2 seconds to get it perfect again is all you need. Any marks come right off without smudging. The haptics give a great feel as you navigate. The price is excellent for the quality of this phone. Highly recommended.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'T Dono', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'My favorite phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Phone is slim, light, and durable.

When searching for phones for my son, I was prone to break phones or submers them, this phone grabbed my attention. The gorilla Glass Victus screen with military spec drop protection as well as ip68 waterproofing is reassuring. At under $400 price is fair. The phone is not overly bulky, it performs a snappy as any other, the screen is great. Basically this is a flagship phone spec from a few years ago without the $1,000 price tag. Of course it has the Motorola customizable features beyond plane Android, added secure folders and the ability to interact with Windows base computers, particularly the ThinkPad. But even if you're not using it for these purposes, it is a great performing phone that does all the things that should do. The camera is very good, talk quality is good, the stereo speaker sound/quality is good, perhaps a bit more peak volume would be suggested in future rendition but still adequate. The biggest frustration is when searching for phones like this, Amazon does not discern and reviews what phone is being reviewed. So when you look at the amount of stars this phone has, it is not at all clear that it reflects this phone, certainly the comments do not as therefore many different models. It seems to me that there should be a way for them at Amazon too straighten this out 🧐\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sue', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything is good except the camera capability', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The unboxing experience was quite nice. The box felt soft and leathery. Motorola is now probably the only phone company to provide a charger in the box that is 68 watts!The phone itself has a nice soft finish on the back and the screen goes quite bright for whenever your going outside in the sun. Its a fast 120hz display so media is quite smooth. The motorla edge plus 2023 is also lighter than i expected while still packing a punch in performance with its chipset. I can play most games on max graphics and still getting 60 frames.Charging is now not an issue whatsoever. I can plug the phone know for 20 minutes and it already gives me 50 percent.Some minor drawbacks would be the easiness to find a good case for the phone. Not many companies take in motorola phones to make cases that have a magsafe magnet.Another complaint i have with the phone is the camera quality. The photos it takes in good lighting conditions are truly impressive and almost looks like the real thing. It gives immersive and good detail at far distance objects. However, it is not all that great with photos in lower lighting conditions. Photos seem to be a little over exposed leading them to have more noise and worse color grading. Details also seem to be worse as i can't capture clouds as good during cloudy days. Things just don't look natural.That's all i have to say. Overall it is a good phone with only those camera drawbacks.\nRead more""}]",43.80475594493116,B0C2W7YYHM,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C2W7YYHM,

I switched over to RCS chats with as many people as possible, but iPhone users would occasionally miss a message from me.

I lose signal in buildings where my Moto G Play 2023 would still be hanging on to a bar or two.I decided to disable the 5G by dialing *#*#4636#*#* and changed the preferred network to LTE/GSM/WCDMA (PRL). The mobile data had a _severe_ latency problem when connected to a _weak_ 5G signal. Instead of resorting to a 4G LTE connection, it struggled and waited to transfer data over 5G and took forever to open web pages, etc. Once I set LTE as the preferred network, everything was much faster. The mobile data was fine with a strong 5G connection outisde, but once you went in a building and had a weaker 5G signal, you could forget it. I did run an Ookla speedtest with the weak 5G and after waiting several minutes for the site to load, I got about 15MB/s. I switched to 4G and got about the same speed but didn't have to wait NEARLY as long for the website to load or for the test to start.It took a few days for me to get used to have a fingerprint scanner on the power button instead of on the M logo on the back of the phone, but it works about as well as the fingerprint scanners I've had on my other Motorola phones.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'anthony craft', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'New phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very smart.

I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Emmanuel', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Camera and great overall phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've been waiting to get the 12 for a while now coming from a 9 PRO.

It came with its own apps. Phone, messages, calendar, email, etc... This phone comes with all Google Apps. Including the keyboard. Apparently OnePlus has given up on actually building solid apps and are just slapping Google apps into it. Had I known this I would have probably gotten a Google Pixel or Samsung phone.The allure of OnePlus was that I was freeing myself from these corporate eco-systems that harvest my data and provide no privacy. Well not anymore. With the OnePlus 12 you get the Google Phone app, Google Messenger, Google Calendar, Gmail (so none of my private email accounts I use on my own domains can be added without routing all my email through Google servers to be scanned). At least OnePlus gave me a Notes app! You can disable these apps in the app manager but you can\'t uninstall them.If I don\'t want my text messages scanned and synced with Google I could download a 3rd party texting app, same for all the other system apps. But there\'s two problems. First is that other apps are way less trustworthy, and secondly they often cost additional money to buy. And who knows when and how they might get ""updated"" over time.What really drives me crazy is that this phone uses Gboard, Googles keyboard. I have no idea what Google is collecting from everything I type. I really wanted a free from big tech phone. I thought OnePlus was different. This is a sad day.Other than this being a Google-everything phone, it\'s pretty good. The hardware is solid but the software could use some polishing. The camera is good but the built in editing software is horrendous. The camera doesn\'t shoot using the full amount of megapixels unless you switch it to a special mode, and then it can only shoot in RAW or JPEG... Not HEIF for some reason. Weird. Since HEIF supports 10bit and 4:2:2 color and smaller file sizes. Nope. If you want to use the full 50MP it\'s either massive RAW file or JPEG.The screen edges are curved. Makes it feel like a phone from 10 years ago. But the screen is bright and beautiful.By default the screen resolution is lowered, I left it that way because I can\'t see the difference. The power mode is lowered, again, left it that way because its so fast and snappy I can\'t imagine wanting more. The battery life is AMAZING... At the lowered resolution and power mode.I use Nova Launcher because I cannot stand the Google Discovery thing being baked into this phone. If you swipe all the way to the left it pulls up Google Discovery. And you can\'t turn it off. I hate Google and want nothing to do with their stuff. This phone really forces everything Google on you.Do I like the phone? Yes. Do I love it? No. I hope OnePlus goes back to building their own apps and not just cramming Googles into it. If in wanted Google I\'d buy Google Pixel.The slogan of the OnePlus company is ""never settle."" Well, not only did they settle, they seem to have given up.

The last foldable phone I had was the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2. I liked it a lot but eventually grew tired of the heaviness and ended up selling it. I also found the tall, slim, remote control profile of the outer screen to be uncomfortable to use at times, not to mention its unwieldy reachability. Unfortunately, Samsung has chosen to stick with the tall, skinny, barely useable design of the outer screen. OnePlus, on the other hand, provides a normal size outer screen, much better hinge with almost no detectable crease when open, a larger screen and many say an even better camera (albeit a much more obtrusive one) than even the new Samsung Fold 6! And even though it does not have the IP48 submersible rating Samsung has or the wireless charging, it does come with a proprietory 67 watt fast charger in the box that allows it to charge the phone from zero to 100% in under 45 minutes. Neither Samsung nor the new Pixel Pro 9 foldable can achieve anywhere near that level of fast charging. And the OPO beats both of those products in battery life by a mile! It's a matter of personal preference of course but, for me, the OPO is the far superior choice . You may feel otherwise. Oh yeah, forgot to mention it's just as light to hold and carry around as the new Samsung Fold 6 despite having a wider outer screen and a bigger inner screen. And with 512 GB it is hundreds of dollars cheaper than a comparable new Samsung or Pixel foldable, especially with the trade-in deal OnePlus is offering. You should also know unfortunately, OnePlus is only offering three years of software updates for this phone and four years security updates, while Samsung is promising 7 years. But honestly, there's no way I'm going to hang on to this phone for three more years. I'll likely trade it in when the OnePlus Open 2 makes its debut next year or the year after.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Switched From Z Fold 6', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024', 'Review Body': ""So about a month ago I decided it was time to finally break away from the apple eco system. I was sick of it. I really liked the refined design of the fold 6 and knew I wanted something that felt vastly different from a candy bar form factor.The phone was great and had a lot of features that wowed me. The AI tools were fun and silly and the screens were bright and vibrant. I got blue bubbles working at home and thought I was good to go.A week passed and I realized I wasn't in love. That damn front screen is just so narrow. I have little hands. I'm a small guy. I didn't think it would bother me. I couldn't type a sentence on it to save my life. The cases for it added such a strange cheap bulky feeling to the phone and made me feel like I was carrying around a TV remote. The inner screen was so damn glossy, I couldn't see outside or even in my apartment for that matter because it reflected EVERYTHING around me and was covered in smudges in an instant. You can't set the phone down flat on a table because of the camera placement. It was also uncomfortable to hold with those sharp corners.The one plus open has fixed all of those issues for me. The inner screen feels so much more premium and the outer screen is a perfect size. I love the anti glare inside and can't get over how shallow the crease is. I honestly even like the OS more. Coming from iOS, it's a little more inviting. Of course I miss the wireless charging and AI features, but I can absolutely live without those. The cameras are so much better and I prefer the more tasteful image processing. Samsung pics look like an acid trip, they're so oversaturated. The OnePlus open feels so much more premium and carefully crafted. I also don't really need these phones to be much thinner...I like how solid the open feels. I don't feel like it's going to break every time I unfold it. While it may not be snapdragon 8 gen 3, gen 2 runs extremely well. Battery life is absolutely better even at high performance.So happy to join the OnePlus ecosystem. Such a brilliantly balanced device.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Larry A', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'OnePlus Open vs Z Fold and Pixel Fold', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I have owned  the Samsung  Z Fold 3, 4, and 5. There were so few substantial changes in those releases that I sold the Z Fold 5 within three months of ownership. I never enjoyed using the outer screen for anything, especially if I needed to enter data, because it was too narrow. The cameras were too much of a downgrade from their S-series phones. Although they had pen support, carrying one required a thicker case on an already large and heavy phone. I wear pants with large pockets, but the long skinny foldable would occasionally fall out while sitting down.While the Z Fold interface can be very good, there were too many duplicated apps that added little additional functionality, including their voice assistant. This unnecessarily increased overall complexity when using the phone.I also purchased the S24 Ultra with AI built in, but only for the Samsung apps. Since I don't use their browser, voice assistant, messaging, or mail I didn't have access to much AI on that phone. Plus, I had become accustomed to the larger inside screen and missed that part of the foldable experience.I then tried the Pixel Fold, but did not like its inability to easily lay flat, many apps did not display correctly on the large inside screen, it had heat issues when doing everyday things, and Google's pitiful history of pixel phone support (I have owned several early Pixel phones). I loved the outer screen aspect much better than the Z Fold.I read several reviews for the OnePlus Open that were so good I purchased one and these are my notes so far.Pros- the outer screen is the perfect height and width for typing with my larger thumbs- face unlock is more accurate and faster- it is lighter than the Z Fold and much lighter than the Pixel Fold- it charges in 42 minutes from 0%, so I do not miss or need wireless charging- its larger battery lasts longer than the Z Fold 5- while I am not a phone camera expert, my pictures are noticably better- the interface is much simpler and streamlined with minimal app duplication- I am surprised how much I like their Open Canvas multi-tasking implementation- the crease on the phone is much closer to being invisible than all  Z Folds or the Pixel FoldCons- not water or dust proof, just splash resistant- not a wide selection of good cases\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'luis y.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on April 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excelente teléfono\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Omran', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on August 19, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I was conflicted between this and the newly released Samsung fold 6 and decided to get this to test for a few days in hopes of returning it and getting the more expensive fold 6 if I wasn't totally satisfied with the purchase.I am so far beyond impressed and totally satisfied with my purchase.

You can search online that issue.Tests I did show that the touchscreen responds when the finger is actually is not touching the screen but is 0.5- 1mm ( 1/52"" - 2/52"") away from it!This leads of course to an absurd overreaction when you handle the phone, even with the palm protection on, it reacts unintentionally. Often even it responses before you have actually touched anything simply because you moved your finger without touching the screen!Then there is the OS, by now Android 14. Another effort to overload an overdo many functions and poorly organize them. all of course in the eternal other obsession ""security"". The [settings] interface is not intuitive and straightforward anymore like it used to be in older android OSs.Whereas like in earlier versions you could customize and prioritize which icon functions you wanted where, that no longer seems to be possible.And then of course the confirmation pop-up window mania.Say you want to turn something off or delete a message/email. You have to go on a regular basis through three confirmations! DUH? Say you select an email or SMS and click on delete, then it asks you first if you want to delete it, and then and then again were you wanted deleted to and finally you need to confirm that! Really? Seriously?notwithstanding that the new and improved absolutely outlandish privacy terms and all other terms all of them with their 10,000 links to other terms about terms and privacy etc. blah blah... I really feel being raped on a daily basis.Furthermore for some reason despite larger screen all the fonts are smaller but layout spacing is larger with more wasted space. (yes I tried the font sizing). Total useless another feature is, that you can choose from an endless variety of different fonts...Any app you start needs a gazillion confirmations requesting permission to give access to this and that, here and there etc. etc. Overall straightforward sensible layout of the interface and functionality is gone.Here\'s a personal comparison and experience.Before I upgraded to this phone I had a Samsung S5 with OS Android 6.01. Everything worked fine I never had an issue SMS and MMS sent out instantaneously and everything else worked. Of course with new apps the phone became, aside from artificial incompatibilities, slower and slower. P part of a marketing ploy probably.Now I have a Samsung A14 5G with Android 14. MMS take much longer and needs two or three confirmations...And when executing a functioning in an app, next time I open the app I have to navigate back as it doesn\'t go back like previously by default.There\'s more but that would take up too much space to writeup here.Remember the peaceful relaxed time when we had a Bell telephone and a typewriter?We were able to communicate and even managed to fly two men to the moon and bring them safely back...\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Internetsuperstar', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best Phone Deal—Galaxy A14 5G is a Game Changer', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Let me tell you, folks, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G—factory unlocked, 64GB, black, renewed—is an absolute steal.

After it updated to Android 9 I didn\'t like the fact that you could no longer see all open apps in the new window-switching view, and it forced a google search toolbar, and a number of other things I thought were worse, so I used directions on xda to revert back to 8.1.I was perfectly happy with this for many years.Then a security-related app I was using notified me that Android 8.1 was not secure and has not received security updates for years. So I have to get the latest version of Android.Then I find out that Motorola doesn\'t publish security or Android version updates to the phone past Android 9, so my only option is to buy a new phone or flash a 3rd party ROM. I looked for instructions and ROMs, and LineageOS seemed to be the primary other option, but I ran into many problems.So I looked up what phones were similar to the Moto x4 and provided the longest term of security and software updates. Samsung Galaxy A14 5G seemed to be the winner so I bought it. It\'s 6 years newer than my Moto x4 so it should be an enjoyable upgrade at least right? Wrong.* It\'s much thicker and taller. Too tall for my liking; difficult to use with one hand - yes I\'ve tested the ""one-handed features"".* The fingerprint reader is worse. The Moto x4\'s works 90%+ of the time, the A14\'s works about 40% of the time.* The battery takes many hours more (can be more than twice as long) to recharge (via USB 3.0 to my PC) and drains as fast or faster.* No call recording.* No view all open apps ability.* Various other annoyances related to how the software functions on this phone/android version.The only noticeable improvements are more customization of notifications & layout.New Android versions & phones are barely different and many of the changes are often downgrades. Hyping them up and making us buy new phones to get security updates is such a scam. My Moto x4 could have lasted me another decade at least.I hate the smartphone industry.

The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%.

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kylee Parker', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Surprisingly Perfect', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I was VERY reluctant to buy a phone off Amazon.

When I started doing some research, I noticed this deal, where I could get a top-of-the-line phone from 2 years ago for less than half price. Spec-wise, this device is equivalent to the s22 ultra with very minor exceptions (EXTREMELY minor, like camera and variable refresh rate).Comparing this device to all the current budget phones from Google, Apple, Samsung, Nord, Moto, TCL, etc., this device seems to be the best value for the price. Between the refresh rate, battery, AMOLED HDR display (boasting 1400 nits of brightness) , stereo speaker audio, 12gb ram, security/software updates (for at least another couple of years at the time of writing), this phone is absolutely killer.The refurbished part scared me at first, as I normally buy all my devices new, but I have no complaints here. My device genuinely feels brand new.My only complaints about this phone are mostly personal problems rather than the phone being faulty. For example, I kind of hate how clear the front-facing camera is. I may need to get new glasses or something, but the picture is more detailed than looking in the mirror. When I take a selfie, I see all the disgusting blemishes in high detail (I'll work on being less ugly, but regardless, it maybe something to note if you take a lot of selfies, you may need some software to blend the photos a little better).Another complaint is the jarring effect of the main camera trying to switch focus. I don't take very many pictures, but if you're trying to take a fast picture, that might be an issue.The display does not allow for 144hz and 1440p at the same time. It's kind of a bummer, but I'm just excited to finally leave my 60hz life behind.Opening a couple of games, this phone performs extremely well, but I did find it odd that it did not allow for higher graphics options on games like Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal, since it defaulted these games to high graphics rather than highest (not that I play waifu simulator or Diablo Immoral, but I did need to benchmark my credit card somewhere).Lastly, this may be just my shipment, but the cord did not work for transferring data from my old Note 8 to the S20. Fortunately, you can transfer everything wirelessly, and the cord I got works for fast charging. It's just an odd issue worth noting.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this device. I don't normally write reviews, but here I am writing a book on my experience with it, so maybe that's a testimony in itself. Hopefully this helps someone on-the-fence about picking this one up.Edit: this was purchased from Edge Cellular\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone, Display, Speed.

I bought this phone refurbished from them in, supposedly, excellent condition. Basically meaning that it wouldn\'t have any scratches on the back of the phone or on the screen. Unfortunately, the phone had very clear signs of image burn-in. This was disheartening, seeing as to how I paid for a higher amount to get a product in better condition. It wasn\'t even advertised anywhere on the listing that it would potentially have display issues, much less actual burn-in. I had contacted them on the issue, and apparently they\'re not able to offer replacements, they gave me a choice of returning in for a full refund or keeping for a small partial refund equal to the difference of their excellent condition and good condition phones. I ended up going with the partial refund, because fortunately, it doesn\'t get in the way of any of my use with it. I would not recommend buying from them.Product: Now for those who want to know about the product itself and whether or not to buy it. The display is incredible, even in 2023\'s standards. I use the phone at 120hz with the lower resolution because I don\'t watch much media on it and mainly use it for social and gaming.  It supports 120hz refresh rate at 1080p resolution and 60hz at 1440p. The display itself is another great part of the phone, the colors you get with it are just amazing.  It is an AMOLED display with HDR10, which really helps with contrast between your blacks and whites and entire color spectrum.The phone comes equipped with 12gb of ram, allowing for not only a stutter-less gaming experience, but also quick multi-tasking with apps. I\'ve really enjoyed the phone for the time I\'ve had it, it\'s quick with any task I try to use it for, not once have I had an app lag or slow down. The crisp screen and smooth motion gives the premium experience you\'d want with a more expensive phone. The only real downsides I could even think of saying about this device is that it is an older phone, so software support won\'t last too much longer as of the time of writing this review; and this display doesn\'t have some of the more modern feature that the newer Galaxy phones have, such as Dynamic Refresh Rate, which basically optimizes the phone\'s use of the 120hz refresh rate.Overall, I\'d recommend getting this phone over newer ones at the same price point and even older flagships, it\'s a great price for all that you get with it, premium user experience, feel, and the camera is amazing even with it being a few years old.Though, if you\'re buying it refurbished like I did, I don\'t recommend buying it from ""GreenTech Refurbished"".\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Anonymous4847364899', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Review', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': ""My 3rd Samsung.

UNLOCKED, one issue called a network unlock code, read review!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I took photos of the phone the day of arrival but now cant find them.. but the phone came in EXCELLENT condition although the packaging was just a box with little to ensure a safe delivery. The phone was unlocked but a **NETWORK UNLOCK CODE** kept popping up when sim card was insterted. (Thats the photo in this review.) So I swore the phone wasnt unlocked. Reached out to the seller and my carrier which was walmart family mobile. I was told by my carrier i needed a new sim card. So i ordered it and when it finally arrived,  boom same error. My carrier reset the sim many times and still no luck. When i had messaged the seller they gave me a code that wasnt right and when i reached out again, still another wrong code. What the phone fails to warn you is that only after a few attempts it will lock you out completely. It will then say **MASTER KEY CODE** needed. I googled what that was and it seemed like a hopeless code to obtain. The startup on the phone says AT & T. So i took it to their store and they had said that yes the phone was unlocked!! But the network was locked to walmart family mobilewhich was my carrier . So come to find out the code i needed, the first code, the network unlock code, I needed from my carrier!  They absolutely missed it and after days of this mess and ongoing phone calls, finally the walmart family mobile agent on that day in the At&T store had told me the codes i needed from day one. Idk how they just skipped the option and blamed my sim card. The codes arent a secret and im still unsure why they didnt recommend theirs to fix it. I guess they just assumed it wasnt their codes needed. But it was!!! Unbelievable right!! So then were now stuck on master key code and no one, my carrier, nor AT&T, nor samsung can help with that. Due to the sellers wrong codes, me googling the wrong codes, and most of all my carriers support line not mentioning their codes, I was locked out and was gonna return the phone. However AT&T did show me other sim cards put into the phone by other carriers were working. It was still unlocked but just couldnt now be used on family mobile and possibly all tracphone carriers due to the master key code lock. So with that said I swapped to AT&T prepaid and got their sim card and it all worked great! It was recommended to get the sim card from the AT&T store directly because sometimes those sim kits at walmart dont always work correctly and are nonrefundable. So if this issue happens to you just be sure to ask your carrier for those network codes!! The seller now knows what to suggest if this happens to another and I'm telling you that the carrier has the codes and all will be fine. Also the seller offered me a replacement phone  and partial refund for this issue. I declined a replacement only because I couldnt send this phone back and await a new one. I was already without a phone long enough dealing with this for days. So the seller at least still gave me a partial refund and that was okay with me. So the customer service is well and fair from them!!! Also even AT&T said the phone itself was in such great shape! So far so good on the phone itself, everything is working as it should.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ThatsY', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Worked perfectly.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024', 'Review Body': 'A little slow now and then compared to most modern mobile phones, but certainly faster than the S9 which is what I transferred over from.

If I dare to let the battery drain completely, it's a toss up on if it will charge again at all. Have tried multiple different cords and bricks, no luck. The screen continues to crack and splinter. I'll likely be on the market for a replacement in less than a year. (I never go through phones this fast, the phone I was using before this was a Samsung S8 active. It's honestly in better shape than this one.)Original:The phone is fine, does it's job. I'm not a heavy user. Calls, texts, simple browsing.It still seems to want to be a Verizon phone - I'll have to figure out how to handle that on my own. For now, my voicemail is finicky and the phone is constantly downloading nonsense apps without my input. (So many games!)I'm no stranger to buying refurbished unlocked phones. I've been doing it for years, this is the first time I've gotten a bit burned on it.It could have been prevented, though. If you're looking to buy, be very picky about the condition the phone comes in and immediately request a refund.Before I ever started the phone up, I noticed a small crack in the top of the screen and excess glue around the bezel. I figured it was fine, I'd ignore that and go on. Chalked it up to the cost of getting a refurbished phone.Don't do that.I should have immediately contacted the seller (PDI Mobile) at that point.Since then, the screen has cracked considerably despite having not dropped it. It went into my pocket, uncracked, and came out of my pocket cracked. I had a simple protective cover on it. I have never in my life cracked a phone screen.I assume the cheapest screen available was used to replace the original. It's a good way to cut the costs down.Despite ignoring the first issues, I was well within Amazon's return window at that point and the seller refused. I contacted Amazon customer support, they escalated it to the seller, and the seller again refused.Currently rocking the phone with a piece of scotch tape on the screen so the glass doesn't splinter off into my finger. Classy!So, be picky. And maybe steer clear of phones sold by PDI Mobile.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'CatCrazy', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The phone is working great so far.

In the box were the usual accessories, charging cord and wall adapter. I removed all the useless apps that phones come with, and stopped all the useless processes. Even so, the first few weeks were rough, as the battery would drain every day. At night, with 0 use, it would drain 20-30% in 8 hours. But then it seemed to equal itself out, and battery is great. It only drains by 1% at night now. I\'m not sure what was going on with that. I read the specs before I received it, and it works as expected for me. No usability issues at all. Android Auto works perfectly with this, as opposed to continually disconnecting with my old phone.

I really like this phone coming from a conventional handset.  Some of my ideal phone criteria are:- Compact device- Mainstream/higher end performance- DurabilityHere is why this phone works for me.- Size:  My previous phone was S10e.  Yes it was old but I liked the compact size compared to many larger phones these days.  Even the standard S24 is bigger.  Although it is thicker, I like the fact that it fits in my pocket comfortably.- Performance:  It has the latest processor, 512GB of storage and 12 gig of memory.  The camera is now on par with other premium devices and now is truly considered a flagship device.  All good.- Durability:  Don\'t get me wrong...  The flip phone will probably never be as durable as a conventional handset, but the Z flip now has dust protection in addition to moisture protection.  Now that Samsung has gone through several life cycles, I feel comfortable using the fold devices.- Price:  People complain that the price went up by $100.  There are deals to be had and ways to bring down the price.Summary:My old S10e did pretty much everything that newer phones do in terms of the features. including wireless pay and reverse charging.  The only reason for me to look for a new phone was to address the failing (aging) battery.  As it was a good time for me to look for a new device, I wanted to considering something different and new.  The Z flip added the folding ""trick"", and it is a welcoming change.  One, I can mostly triage messages and etc on the cover screen and minimize the big screen.  Two, the main screen, because of its oddly long aspect ratio, works pretty well working with 2 separate windows.  It is very useful.  I like the new form factor and the functions that it adds.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'JCal', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very light and easy to hold', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I was a little nervous about ordering this for fear that it would get crushed during the shipment to an APO address but it arrived without any damages.The screen is amazing.It's great for pants and sweaters with short pockets.

Prima di decidermi all\'acquisto, ho scartabellato avanti e indietro le pagine web dedicate all\'argomento e, dopo aver scartato prodotti con prestazioni stratosferiche, utili solo al prezzo del prodotto, mi sono concentrato sulla fascia media che, per come uso io il cellulare, è quella che mi interessa. Vagabondando a destra e a manca, tra specifiche dei prodotti e relative recensioni, mi sono convinto ad acquistare questo Blackview Color 8 che sembrava soddisfare le mie esigenze.Il prodotto è arrivato nella sua scatola, racchiusa in un cartone Amazon, perfettamente sigillata a garanzia del prodotto intonso. Al suo interno ho trovato il cellulare già parzialmente carico e racchiuso in una cover antiurto, una plastica per proteggere lo schermo, il caricabatterie con il cavetto usb C e un manualino multilingue che può fungere da guida alla prima accensione.Prima accensione e, per me, PANICO! Collegato il telefono alla rete elettrica per evitare problemi durante la migrazione dei dati dal vecchio cellulare, dopo l\'impostazione della lingua e la password di Google, arriva il momento di collegare il cellulare al wi-fi. Impostato l\'SSID e inserita la password relativa, tappo la casella ""prosegui"" e, a quel punto, il sistema mi dice che ha trovato il nome della rete ma che non può accedere a internet. Riprovo e... stesso risultato. A questo punto mi chiedo come mai; eppure possiedo un tablet sempre della Blackview con cui la procedura ha funzionato correttamente, come ha funzionato sempre correttamente con apparecchiature di altra marca. PANICO! ""ecco, mi è arrivato un prodotto difettoso che non si collega al wi-fi, cosa faccio? Lo restituisco? Telefono all\'assistenza e magari mi rispondono in inglese?..."" CALMA! Ci riprovo. Questa volta mi accorgo che sul tastierino alfanumerico con il quale inserisco la password di rete, in basso a destra, c\'è un simbolino di spunta verde al quale non avevo fatto caso. Speranza!... sarà mica che invece di ""prosegui"", bello evidenziato in azzurro, devo tappare quello?... Sii, questa volta si collega senza problemi e scarico le mie tensioni accumulate con relativi improperi, contro chi ha pensato di non includere la validazione della password nel tasto ""prosegui"". Dopodichè tutto è filato liscio e ho trasferito i dati essenziali, foto e quant\'altro dal mio vecchio cell al nuovo.Quello che mi ha lasciato stupito del nuovo acquisto è la quantità di impostazioni che si possono configurare, non ultime quelle di poter limitare la carica massima della batteria tra il 70% e il 90% per non rovinarla troppo in fretta e la possibilità di scalare le dimensioni dei caratteri. Il sensore di riconoscimento dell\'impronta digitale, posto sul fianco destro, funziona alla perfezione, cosa che ritengo importantissima per la quantità di siti che ormai richiedono l\'accesso tramite impronta (Spid, Io, banca, ecc.). Per il resto, trovo il telefono reattivo, con schermo di ottime dimensioni (6,75""), batteria con buona durata, e comparto fotografico dignitoso... e qui bisogna ricordare che un cellulare non è una macchina fotografica e che quindi mi fanno ridere quelli che decantano le meraviglie delle foto scattate con un oggetto che scannerizza ciò che inquadra contro una macchina che scatta le immagini tramite otturatore.Nel complesso, lo giudico un ottimo prodotto per la fascia di prezzo in cui è inserito, e mi sento di consigliarlo, oltre a chi è perennemente su chat e giochini vari, anche a chi, come me ne fa un uso pratico ormai imprescindibile nella vita di tutti i giorni... telefonate comprese.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Simone', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on August 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""L'ho preso per mio figlio.

The RF performance of this phone seems to allow it to get a workable signal where other phones do not.  I was often in areas which seemed to have no to marginal coverage.  Now with this phone they all seem workable.  Casually comparing its performance to other kinds of phones in use in the same area by others on various networks, this phone will typically be able to make calls when others cannot.  It is clearly better than the phone it replaced.  Perhaps it is realted to Motorola being an old line radio company.  Who knows.  But it is a superior RF performer.I tested using different SIM cards and it works with both Verizon and T-Mobile (a GSM carrier) networks.  This is pretty unusual because most phones are either Verizon or GSM but not both.  The phone is advertised as working with ALL US carriers and this seems to be a good claim.  Maybe the thing is an SDR?  Wouldn\'t that be nice.The wifi section has both 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands.  Both work very well.  Using a directional beam as the access point I was able to get a workable 2.4 link at about a half mile.  If you want to play with this I used a Ubiquiti Powerbeam PBE M2 400 which you can get on Amazon.The phone is also very stable, having not yet crashed after a few months of use.  The phone comes with Android 11, which is very good and it will ask you to upgrade to 12.  Both versions are excellent and stable on this phone.  There are no hangs or crashes.The memory holds all the apps I need and is only about 60% used.  Battery life can go way past two days if you are just on standby and have all the saver features turned on.  The two days is with ""normal"" use as in my kind of normal use versus playing games or watching video all day.  Charging is quite fast and considering you can run a day with far less than 100% battery, the time to refresh the battery is quite quick.The camera is average, which in my case is good enough, but keep in mind it\'s a cell phone.  If you want to do real photography get a DSLR.For the money you will not find a better deal.  There is no way I would pay $1200 for a phone especially when I can get 90% of the way there for 5% of the cost.Mot has really done a great job.  I hope they keep up the great work because we need solid, good performing phones at this cost level.If you want a phone that just works and does so very well and don\'t care about fashion, get this.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'DeAngelo', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I picked this phone specifically because, aside from needing a replacement for my broken phone, I wanted a stylus phone to play stuff on a DS emulator (and 3DS emulator but I can't find any settings other than downscaling it into ugly mode to get a good frame rate, but I wasn't really expecting that capability for this price.) for those that don't know, you need a pressure stylus to get good accuracy as that's what the DS uses, whereas third party phone stylus...es? Styli? Not sure the plural for that. But they are just rubber bumps at the end that mimic the capacitor touch of a finger. Been playing Trauma Center and the accuracy is nearly perfect, and what imperfections there are might be down to the game or emulator rather than the phone. My only real complaint, and an issue I've never really had before even on cheaper phones, is that it starts to lag as I type long blocks of text. Eventually being nearly unusable. I bypass this by just copypasting my current text into a notepad document each time the lag starts and then pasting the lot of it back when I'm done (had to do that once while typing this review) so I'm not sure what's up there. Otherwise great phone.

I use the POWER version of this phone myself and had confidence that it would be a good upgrade from a basic as a first smart phone.It is an EXCELLENT choice as the screen is large and you can configure everything so as not to be too confusing for a non tecchie. The phone call performance is excellent with good sound quality in both directions. This is NOT the fastest phone or one that has a lot of storage or memory...but I knew that going in and I can always add a big microSD if she ever needs more than is included as there is a single slot for one right next to the sim card in the pop out drawer,This one worked perfectly moving the Sim Card from a T Moble account phone and because the PRIOR phone was a BASIC phone...the numbers/contacts did NOT move over or download by themselves as they WILL if you are moving from a smart phone. I had to first EXPORT the contacts to the BASIC phone SIM card before moving the card to the new Moto Pur. Lots of easy videos on this 2 minute job on line.Once I did that...all was well after allowing some time to load up, We got a nice leatherette billfold type case for this and we have a happy family member. I really don't think there is a better smart phone in this price range and the camera is WAY better than you might think...I think they measure the single lens rather than adding up all separate lenses...NOT the STATE of the ART camera in a $1k phone but Really nice quality at 1/10th the price! If you want more power and storage and camera...get the power version for 100 bucks more...but in the meantime...if you're needs and your budget are not as great...the Pur is an excellent choice.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Francisco Cruz', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 9, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llegó bien empacado y antes de lo estimado, lo quería como regalo para un familiar y quedó encantado; funcionando correctamente hasta ahora\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Item arrived within schedule and buyer is fully satisfied with it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Shawn Mills', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 4, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This product when I purchased it was described as new and unlocked.

All three of these providers are not prominent or even available where I live, and upon attempting to remove the apps by enabling developer settings and debug tools, I found that the developer settings had already been enabled. This, along with a dead battery on arrival, indicated to me that the device had been tampered with as well as its packaging.

I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly.

Amazon refused to honor replacement arrangement.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I received the phone within 2 days of ordering. The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement.

It\'s downright cute.It\'s also an interesting device.  I assumed it would be running some really stripped down Android, but it\'s running an OS called Mocor which offers a pretty refined dumb phone interface.  Seriously, if you used a cell phone in 2004, it shouldn\'t take you long to get the hang of what you\'re doing with this thing.  Apparently this is the OS that was on the re-released Nokia 3310 3g back in 2017.  It seems to be pretty refined.  I didn\'t run into any bugs while using it.I couldn\'t tell you a lot about that re-released 3310, but don\'t expect old school Nokia-like durability out of this device.  Its outer shell is a soft plastic.  I dropped it onto concrete from maybe two and a half feet up and it left little boogered up places in two spots.  It didn\'t damage the phone\'s operation at all, fortunately.I was worried about battery life since the included (fully removable and replaceable) battery is only 1000mAh, but since it\'s not a touch-screen smartphone the battery actually lasts a long time.  I think I went about 10 days before I had to recharge it (95% of that standby).  It\'s got a USB-C charging port.  It also has pins on the bottom so you can use the included charging stand.  It also includes a short USB-C cable to plug into either the phone or the base and a 0.55A charging brick.The box also contains a SIM card and brochure for Speedtalk Mobile.  I had never heard of them before, but their pricing is pretty competitive.  A brief look around their website didn\'t reveal to me which carrier network they use, but I suspect it\'s T-Mobile since they have ""America\'s Largest 5G Network"" in a portion of their marketing material, which is a marketing term used by T-Mobile as well.  Since the phone is unlocked for other carriers, I saw no need to test the Speedtalk service.It has a decent manual included, though for a phone that seems to be wanting to market toward seniors, they could have made it bigger.  The print isn\'t as minuscule as what\'s in the instructions that come with a lot of overseas products you see nowadays, but any seniors will definitely need to get their readers out to get anywhere with it.I was able to make and receive calls on the T-Mobile network (through Mint Mobile).  I could also send and receive SMS and MMS messages.  It did take a little bit to get registered on their network completely.  It showed T-Mobile as the carrier for a while and wouldn\'t let me make or receive calls, but after 20-30 minutes I could.  You can still disable caller id for your outgoing calls with this device, something that\'s been missing from Android for quite some time now.It recognized and showed reception for Verizion (via Visible) but I was unable to make or receive calls, nor could I send or receive txts.  I left that SIM in the phone for over a day just to make sure.  Verizon I believe is now implementing a draconian cell white list like AT&T (eg only letting Apple or Samsung devices on their network other than the ones they sell themselves).You can pair bluetooth headsets to make calls and listen to media from the internal storage or sdcard.  There is no 3.5mm jack and I have no way of testing but I really doubt if a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter would work with this device.  There also is no camera.  To my knowledge there is no GPS chip onboard, which makes this pretty ideal as a burner phone.  Finally, though I mentioned it before, the screen is not a touch screen.  The only thing that sets it apart from classic dumb phones is its 4G VoLTE and Bluetooth support.It has a pretty nice FM radio app.  It auto searches for channels that have good reception the first time you run it and it doesn\'t require anything extra to be plugged in to it for it to work unlike most Androids.  The downside to the radio app is that it won\'t play over bluetooth, only the phone\'s internal speaker.  The internal speaker isn\'t bad.  It\'s easily on par with your typical mid-budget Android device.I didn\'t test the SOS function, but that could come in handy for the target audience.  In addition to seniors, this would make a pretty great first phone for kids or maybe even teens who struggle to use their smart phone responsibly.  A third target audience would be where I find myself sometimes--on the edge of wanting to get as far off the grid as possible.  This phone, or one like it, would be a good start toward that end.The flashlight function utilizes and LED bulb located on the top of the phone that is fairly bright.  Since it\'s main purpose is to be a flashlight and not a flash bulb for photography, it actually projects light like a flashlight so it works better than the led torches on most smartphones.It has an sdcard slot underneath the battery along with the two SIM slots.  I am unsure what the maximum capacity for the sdcard is, as I couldn\'t find it in the listing nor in the product manual.  When plugged into a computer it functions as a USB Mass Storage device rather than an MTP device as Android has since version 5 or thereabouts.The buttons are large and faintly backlit when awake.  They make a satisfying clicky noise when you press them.  Everything about the phone just feels good to me, like some genuine love was sprinkled in with the engineering.  I\'m not really familiar with what dumb phones are available on the market right now, but this has got to be one of the best.  A few times while using it I felt a lot of nostalgia for technologically simpler days.If you\'re looking for a smart phone but got here because of the price, be aware that there is at least one smart phone in this price range which can perform adequately with Android (you can peruse my reviews from this year to find it).  If you or the intended recipient of this phone needs a working phone in its simplest form, or desires to avoid being tracked and listened to on-demand by corporations or government agencies, then this phone deserves serious consideration.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Doodle lover', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Basic phone for calls', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This is a very basic ""dumb"" phone, by that I mean that it is primarily for phone calls no internet browsing or apps.

I was surprised by the high-quality cardboard packaging, the contents consisting of a telephone, charging cable, tool for the card slot, a short operating manual and even a transparent soft cover with a pleasant feel. Since I was “catapulted” from Android 8 (my old Huawei) to Android 12 in the Blackview, I first looked for information about Android 12 on the Internet before setting it up, which later turned out to be helpful (and in my opinion also represents a user manual ). In most cases, anything that wasn\'t clear to me could be researched online.What was unusual for me was the fingerprint sensor on the side “power” button. On my old Huawei, the recognition was on the back in the upper third, which is an advantage in my opinion. But I knew that when I ordered it and I\'ll definitely get used to it.\ufeffCredit goes to customer service who I contacted with a technical question. It gets the rating “5 stars” from me.

The Blackview A 53 clearly exceeded my price-performance expectations. It makes a high-quality impression and meets my requirements: calling and taking photos in good quality, navigation and Bluetooth reliably, speed on the network and image structure/brightness as well as storage capacity of 64 GB are absolutely sufficient for me.

I wasn't looking to spend a ton of money to replace it and found this A13 for under 200.00.  It was a decent upgrade from the A10 I had.  The camera works amazingly well, the screen resolution is crisp, clear.  If you 'live' on your phone you can find one that will better suit your needs, but for a casual phone user like myself (mostly talk, text, web surfing, etc.) this was a great little upgraded phone for me.Set up was super simple.  Pop your SIM card out of your old phone, and reinsert it into the new one.  Make sure both phones are connected to the same wifi, as the new phone will automatically ask you to transfer data from your old phone to new.  This process was fairly quick and really hands-free.  Be sure to back up your contact list to your SIM card in your old phone before doing this, as it will save you the hassle of figuring out who's who if some of the newer contacts haven't been saved to SIM.  Otherwise, the setup of this phone is really quite painless.I'd recommend this phone to anyone who is a causal user and not looking for a powerhouse phone.  It's fast, responsive, aesthetically pleasing to look at, screen is bright and crisp.

I know this can happen with a lot of use but I don't use mine much and it can feel like it is overheating while just sitting idle.Overall the phone is fine for the price and am happy with it.What I am unhappy about is the customer service. When you receive the box there is a postcard with instructions should you run into issues while setting the phone up.  I started the set up process and the phone died. I shrugged it off and understood it may arrive with a dead battery. I plugged it into the included charger and let it be. 2 hours go by and I check on it and no charge. I move the plug to another outlet and charge for an hour. Still no charge on the phone.I borrow a charger from my son and his charger worked immediately to charge the phone. Perfect I got a decent phone and bad charger. No problem on the post card it mentioned to reach out for a new one incase the charger doesn't work. It also says to reach out about a problem before leaving negative feedback.This is where the problems start. I iniate a message and I go days without a response. I reach out again and this time they respond. I give them the information they requested and again no response.I reach back out and a week later to inform them I'm going to leave my fair and honest review including the part about the charger. I then get responses it's been sent, I say perfect, 5 days later ask again. I'm told it's been delivered. It hadn't been delivered though. I'm then told check your mail tomorrow, still not there. I ask for tracking and get silence. Inform them I use USPS informed delivery and no package or envelope from them has been recorded coming to my address. At this point they are just ignoring me.I got a new charger, I don't need there's but this is about principle. They ask for you to give them a chance and I was more than patient for month. They lie and tell you whatever to not leave a review.

Performance is about the same as the S10e in battery saver mode (cpu clock limited to 70%). It was a seamless SIM swap to get it working on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile).Main downsides are the lack of wireless charging (all A series lack it), IP water/dust rating, and only supporting up to wifi 5 (rather minor).

It looked like a new phone, couldn\'t find a single sign it had been used. The plastic film was still on the back and sides. For the price it was a great buy. I cant see spending more than a few hundred dollars on one and this was in the $250 area total. There are a couple things I don\'t care for but have nothing to do with it being ""renewed"". The battery life leaves a bit to be desired. My last couple phones all had batteries in the 5000mA range so this having only a 3300mA battery is very noticeable, no more lasting all day and charging at night while sleeping like I\'ve been doing for years with my Moto G Stylus 5G phones(2021&2023 models).I\'m used to using the tempered glass screen protectors which can\'t be used on this one. I\'ve tried a couple of the flexible film ones with it but wasted the money because couldn\'t get them to install properly(without air bubbles everywhere). The phone screen is soft. It will get dents/creases in it if not careful(I put a light crease in mine trying to install a screen protector).  When opened its not perfectly flat, there\'s a shallow area where the fold is but it\'s not  visually noticeable with the screen on at all. Only noticeable by touch and visually when the screen is off. The non expandable memory isn\'t a feature I like. 128GB isn\'t a whole lot nowadays, especially when it\'s common for apps to be 1GB-3GB(like games and Facebook). I used to keep my games, photos, and entertainment/social media apps on a SD card but now I\'m just being a lot more selective with what I install and quick to uninstall something if it\'s not being used regularly, whereas with expandable memory I\'d just leave them on the SD card. I read that it will no longer receive updates from Samsung so Android 14 is going to be the last operating system upgrade for it.Size is the reason I bought it. Got tired of carrying phones that only fit in back pockets and still have 1/4 of it sticking out. With this I get the same size screen but can put it in any pocket. It\'s unlocked compatible with GSM and CDMA service providers so works with all the major ones.All in all it\'s a good phone loaded with features, looks and functions like a new one for 1/2 the price,and it\'s second life is helping the planet with saving resources and landfill space. A good buy for cheap people like me who cares not 1 bit about having the newest model phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sharistarshine', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Don't Buy It!!!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I loved the concept of a flip smartphone & maybe a new one would work properly but we've tried two of these refurbished ones & within 6 months they end up with a green line down the side & eventually a black blob that covered most of the screen.

This one being foldable easily fits.  There were some big differences in this phone compared to all of my previous cell phones.  For starters, there is no phone jack. Not a deal breaker if you have Blue Tooth ear buds.  Second big difference, there is no slot of a micro SD memory card.  I worked around that by buying a phone with 128 G of internal memory.  That\'s more than enough for all of my music, games, photos and apps.  The third big difference is there are 2 batteries, and they aren\'t easy to replace.  Instead of just removing a cover, there is some disassembly involved to get to them.  I may leave that to the ""Pros"" when the time comes to replace them.  There are tons of videos out there demonstrating all of the features of this phone, so I won\'t go into detail about it.  I will say that I watched a few of them to tweak some display and battery settings to extend the life of the battery such at limiting the percentage of charges.  I just found out it\'s not good on a battery when you charge it 100%.  Didn\'t know that before.  For you Tracfone users, I will confirm that you can take this unlocked phone to Tracfone, put your sim card from your old phone in it, and with a little help from a Tracfone tech, be ready to use it in under 15 minutes.  I thought I needed a Tracfone Sim card kit, and I didn\'t.  In the past I had to wait a few hours up to a day for the new phone to be fully functional - not this time.  Like I said, within 15 minutes it was working.  I wear a hearing aid, and once I configured the phone to work with my hearing aid app, it used the Bluetooth to send audible notifications to my hearing aid.  My wife is thrilled she doesn\'t have to hear my phone announce email and phone calls while we watch TV. I can also play music on my phone and hear it through my hearing aid.  Cool!  I\'m 76 years old, and I found this phone relatively intuitive in its operation.  It only took me a day or two of playing with it to learn my way around.  So far I like it.  I ordered screen protectors and a case to give it protection.  As a renewed cell phone it arrived in excellent shape, like new.  UPDATE 7/8/24  I did find one thing I really don\'t like about the Android 14 operating system - it\'s very difficult to turn on the Data setting.  It\'s a convoluted path to reach a setting that offers only 1 option, to keep ""data turned on when wi-fi isn\'t available"" all of the time. For someone who uses prepaid Tracfone services that don\'t have unlimited data, I have to limit my usage of data.  It took me a half hour to find directions how to access that setting, not fun!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'SAME Computers', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Para ser equipo refurbished está en muy buenas condiciones y además funciona perfectamente.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Doug Henderson', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on January 11, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I prefer small-size phone in general and loved iPhone OS so I never thought I would buy an Android phone.

Only one place has tiny small cometic scratch is on the middle of backcase where the phone is folding, but it is hardly noticeable.

Arrived withAndroid 13 installed. Phone was well packed and came in a plain box with a nice 5Volt 2Amp (9Volt 1.87Amp) charger, USB C charging cable, and SIM Tray removal tool. The box was labeled NEW. The model I received is SM-G986U1. It is NEW, Pristine, Looks and Performs Flawlessly. The phone is Fully Unlocked for all US carriers GSM and CDMA. I put my SIM card and SD card in the dual SIM tray, powered up and in a short while I was up and running. I used the included Smart Switch app to transfer everything from my old Samsung phone. The phone is fast, color and graphics are great. WiFi and Bluetooth connect easily and work flawlessly. Phone connects quickly to Tracfone/Verizon mobile network and switches smoothly between LTE and 5G as I travel along. My Cell service is Tracfone through Verizon. The S20+ supports most of the LTE bands and 5G bands used by Verizon. This is important especially if you live or travel in a weak signal area with Verizon or other CDMA carrier. I don’t know about GSM carriers.  I  first ordered the S20 FE, which, I found out, does not support the mmWave bands needed for the fastest 5G Verizon service or reliably connect to Verizon in my weak signal home location. As a result I couldn’t get connected unless I walked outside my house into my driveway. Someone living in a strong signal area would not notice unless they travel into a weak signal area. This seems to be a problem with the design of the S20 FE and not the fault of the Renewer or Amazon. I wasn't willing to wait and try a replacement S20 Fe 5G so, unfortunately I had to send the S20 FE 5G back, I ordered the S20+ 5G instead. I'm very happy with my decision and with my S20+ 5G which supports 5G mmWave and reliably connects to Verizon in my weak signal area.I can’t say enough good about Stalion Requip.

Shipped fast and arrived early.  Thank you.This phone is great.  The screen is clear, bright and very dim when that's required too.  The internals are snappy and responsive, audio is loud and crystal clear.  Overall it feels like a solid pocket computer.The only negative I have found is the fingerprint reader.  Since it's on the front, under the screen, only thumbprints make sense, and it's sloooow!  Its also unusable if my hands are not completely clean and dry.  I'm always doing filthy things working with my hands, so usually I just swipe and unlock with a pattern.  Coming from years of using LG phones, Samsung could take some pointers on the fingerprint scanner function and location.  It makes me sad that LG is not making pocket computers anymore.  Samsung is good, LG was better overall I think.  Still, it's a good machine for good value.Edit:  the fingerprint reader has stopped functioning completely.  Its is fully useless except as a blingy gimmick.  If you need a phone that will unlock via fingerprint, don't buy this.UPDATE: apparently Samsung is junk.  Dropped last month and even inside full armor, the back glass cracked.  Who builds a phone using glass on the back?  Dumb.  The phone started glitching badly yesterday, one week after warranty expiration.  Lol, typical.  I had to reset the phone 3 times today and the camera and gallery will both cause the phone to lock up requiring a hard reset.  Cannot recommend this or any Samsung phone.  Waste of money, resources, time and energy.  Back to LG quality for as long as I can get one.  None of my old LG phones have failed, they've been upgraded and put away, all still work fine.

I bought this S21+ along with an ""Orange Holiday Europe"" SIM card.The phone arrived in excellent condition, with no scratches or dents. The screen appeared to have been replaced. After setting it up, I tested it by installing SIM cards from AT&T and TELLO, both worked perfectly - it\'s definitely unlocked.Right before the trip, I installed the ""Orange"" SIM card with the phone powered down. Upon arrival in Italy I powered it up, and it immediately connected to the local service. We used Google Maps to get from the airport to our hotel some 50km\'s away, no problems at all.Photos taken on the trip were excellent. We installed Google Translate and Microsoft Translator which worked perfectly and were a real asset in helping us navigate the foreign signs, menus, etc. We also set up Hot Spot and Tethering, and used that along with wireless calling on our US SIM based phones to make and receive free calls and texts to/from US numbers. It all worked as expected with no issues.There are two minor issues to report.The battery life was OK, I would start each day at 100%  but by end of day it typically had around 30% remaining. My new (locked) S23+ easily gets two days on a single charge.I did notice a minor blemish on the screen after a week of using it. At first I thought it was just a greasy smear, but no amount of cleaning has managed to remove it. I didn\'t notice this when I first received the phone so it most likely manifested after use. It would seem to be a flaw with the screen itself. I did not use a screen protector, which may or may not have helped to prevent it from occurring. Fortunately it\'s close to the bottom of the screen and has not really affected the viewing area, nor has it affected the touch screen in the area of the blemish.All-in-all I am happy with this phone. I plan to use it for future international trips as it can do what I need without having to pay the $10-a-day AT&T International Roaming plan - that soon gets very expensive with 2 or more phones.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ryan A.

I ordered a refurbished Samsung S21 PLUS 5G for just under $300. Supposedly in ""Excellent"" condition.  - Positives -- It arrived promptly.- Functionally it worked perfectly.- The screen appears to be new.- It came with a charger / adapter as promised -- more about that in a minute.  - Flaws -- There are scratches along the edge of the case, esp one corner. All sides. The corner is prominent.- The case had been opened and inexpertly resealed. In other words, one side looks quite different from the other. The case will conceal these issues. But they are there.- The charger is ""not compatible"" per the phone and charging is almost negligible, it\'s so slow. Fortunately I have some other chargers that work better.In spite of the cosmetic and charger issues for $300 I believe it will be a good phone. I don\'t want the hassle of exchanging it. Or I would.Is it in what I would call ""Excellent condition""? No. I would describe it as Good. To me, Excellent means there are no obvious flaws. Perhaps the vendor would charge more for my idea of  ""Excellent"" condition.Would I buy Amazon refurbished again? In the past I\'ve purchased multiple refurbished and excellent-graded devices from reputable eBay sellers and have been happier.The eBay feedback system is more punitive and tough on shady sellers. My opinion. As a buyer that makes me feel more secure. I\'ll go to eBay first once again.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alan', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'El paquete llego en buenas condiciones, lo que esperas de Amazon renewed, un buen dispositivo, se siente al tacto bien construido, donde encontraras detalles es en las esquinas del dispositivo, algo común en un dispositivo renewed, pero nada que una buena funda cubra y proteja el dispositivo, se nota la fluidez por el procesador, y un gran sonido al reproducir música, el tema de la batería aún es debatible, normalmente estos celulares llegan con un 85% de vida util pero ya que llevo pocos días usándolo y la mayor parte lo tengo en mi auto contectado, pero si tu idea es tenerlo por bastante tiempo yo recomendaría cambiarle la batería por una nueva en unos años, me encantó el dispositivo, volveré en un tiempo para actualizar si apareció algún problema.

I'll just say that the phone didn't work... AT ALL and I had to return it. Then, I bought this phone from this seller. The description for this phone was clear, complete, it answered all my questions and a few I didn't even know I needed to ask. Most importantly, it was honest. No information was omitted whether it was important or trivial and nothing was misrepresented. The phone I received is, and works, precisely as it was described - unlike the previous phone from the other seller.  This seller, unknowingly, turned a bad experience into a good one. For that, I am very grateful. The Moto One Ace may not be the phone for everyone, but this seller definitely is.

I\'ve got lots more apps I can use. The trouble is that the thing is WAY too sensitive. If you touch it, it comes on to tell you the time. Can\'t figure out how to make it stop doing that. If I carry it in my pocket I\'ll wind up with 5-10 apps opened up when I thought it was on standby. I had to put in my fingerprint to start up and now if my wife wants to answer the phone she has to come borrow my finger to get into the thing. If I\'m watching a video and the phone rings, I dare not miss the answer button or the phone goes away I don\'t know where. I admit it, I\'m 70 years old and millenial Chinese phone designers have no idea what is an intuitive operating system for someone like me. I anticipate a long long learning curve.  Also, the charger/PC port uses an odd size plug rather than the standard C plug my old phones, my camera and other stuff use and I can\'t find an adapter from their so I have to carry around the cord if I don\'t want to risk the phone dying and leaving me stranded without even an Uber call I can make. Woe is me if I lose that cord. I\'ll probably have to buy a dozen of them cause sure as the sun rises, I\'m going to lose several before it\'s all over. I\'m going to have to go full Bluetooth for headphones because after a week the headphone jack won\'t let me fully plug the phone jack in. I\'ll have to live with it\'s quirks. I can\'t afford to wait for it to be repaired. I don\'t want to set up another one (I spent a week figuring the thing out), and I need my phone. There are some things I\'m happy with. If I can just consistently answer a phone call without the thing losing the phone screen, I\'ll probably be okay.

I was very happy to see everything included in the box (sim key ejector, charging cable, plug in adapter) so that was great since some of the reviews I read said parts were not included or missing, ect.The phone needed to be charged right away, and as soon as I plugged in it, the included wall adapter started making a very high pitched buzzing sound, so I swapped it out with a different adapter I already had on hand (you can get them anywhere so not a big deal) and problem was instantly solved.I am completely unfamiliar with Samsung phones, so I was worried about set up, but once I was easily able to change the language from Spanish to English, it was pretty easy to do.I really liked how crisp and clear the graphics were and the phone has a great screen size for gaming. I will say that in my opinion the phone is pretty laggy in loading, but my 12 year old doesn’t really seem to mind and after pretty much living on it for the past two days, it’s safe to say he loves the phone.It took some doing to familiarize ourselves with it, and found it was not as user friendly as an iPhone, but once you figure out how to actually gets the apps on the Home Screen and change the clock, ect, you’re good to go.Pros: great screen size, clear graphics, amazing battery life, 12 year old approved.Cons: A little laggy, not the most user friendly until you get used to it, weird buzzing adaptor.Note: we have not tried installing a SIM card as of yet, so I can’t attest to that.So far this phone has been great, well worth the purchase price, and my son is extremely happy with it, so for that, I would absolutely recommend it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gabriela V.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on February 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Puse a cargare el celular y el cargador se calento muchisimo estubo a punto de explotar o tener un corto circuito en la casa.\nRead more'}]",,B09Z8P34NM,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09Z8P34NM,4g

Main camera almost always makes something blurry. The 200mp is better, but not perfect. Honestly it may have something to do with the default camera software not being very good.

Here are my thoughts after using it for the past few months:Pros of the 13 pro:- Very efficient battery (I can go 2 days without charging if I use it moderately)- Good camera, esp for a budget phone (although I\'m not sure if I can turn off the auto-focus / auto-blur function). The top camera (for close-range shots) is super clear, but the bottom one (for zoomed out shots) is on the fuzzier side, unfortunately.- High storage: having 256 GB really set aside my worries with going overboard on my photo gallery.- Great aesthetics: whoever designed it did a wonderful job cause it\'s probably the prettiest phone I\'ve owned to date.Cons:- Doesn\'t show any call indicators, so I can\'t just ""tap into"" my ongoing call. Instead, I have to go into my phone app in order to view the call or visit the App Vault, which can be annoying.- Xiaomi transfer between phones didn\'t work the best; I\'ll probably have to get a usb-c to -c cable to connect my two phones to successfully transfer all the loose ends.Overall, I think this is a really great phone with neat features, and has made me excited for future iterations of the Redmi Note series.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Romario G.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing functionality battery and connectivity', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The device is amazing.

About 3-4 months after I received it I had a few instances of being called and the phone calls went straight to voicemail even though I did not have my phone set to airplane mode.  Over the next couple months I had times that my text messages would not go through. I knew it was not the Network Verizon as my 2 boys have their phones on my plan and they were right next to me and their phones worked.  Then a big issue started happening in which the \'voice\' part of the phone only worked intermittently.  I use Bixby & Google Assistant, and even though they were set up properly, they only worked sometimes and not others.  Bixby would perhaps hear and pop up on the screen, but not respond to my voice for the request.  Other times it worked correctly.  Just yesterday and today alone I have had to reboot my phone 3 times when I could not use either of those or my talk to text as the microphone and speaker were not working.  I contacted the seller first - never heard from them.  I next contacted Amazon two days in a row and was told there is nothing they can do.  I just finished with my last chat being told this once again.  I told them that had I known I was paying $200 for a phone that would only work a few months - I never would have purchased it.  This is what was erroneously in their item description:  About this item  This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors.

They don't care if it is missing features, even if you are a 25-year customer, because you did not buy it from them. That is what I am dealing with now. In my initial review I indicated you have to visit a store to finish setup because that's what I was told through a Verizon chat. They did swap out the SIM card , but could not do anything else. I was told they do not do any software flashing, they are not even sure what that means, and there was nothing they could do at the retail store to help me.  I had to call the call center again which I literally did from their parking lot because I told them it was the second time I had visited a store and they're representative had told me to go to the store! I spent 2 hours working with, or on hold with, the call center, and still did not get the correct functionality!  They really don't care and don't want to help you unless you pay the astronomical amount of money to get a phone directly from them. My phone still drops calls, does not always call out, does not have voicemail, and does not have the spam filtering. So now I am stuck with either living with that, or paying to upgrade to another phone. The whole reason I bought this one off Amazon is because it still has the micro SD slot and that is what I want. I'm going to try to make it work, I'm very upset with Samsung that they are doing away with the SD slots and hope someday they will bring it back.The bottom line for me is the phone works okay. I have to dial in to get my voicemail now and had to have all of that reset, there is no voicemail icon. There is no way for me to know I have a voicemail I just have to call to see if I have any messages. So if you are okay with a phone that doesn't quite have perfect functionality, then this is a great one. It is decent for the money. If you want a phone that works just like one you would get from the store, bite the bullet and spend the money and go to Verizon.  I have gone to two stores, I have done one chat, and been on the phone with them, multiple agents, for over 2 hours. Apparently this is as good as it's going to get for this phone.Feb 23 initial review:  I read a few of the reviews, somehow I miss the part where if you get a phone off of a site like amazon, you do still have to take it into your provider for setup? My provider is Verizon. I happened to go in there yesterday and said I had a different phone (had both with me) they told me just to move the SIM card and the SD card over and they did not have to do anything. Today only half of the phone functions, and through a chat they told me I have to come in to have their software flashed onto the phone. I was already there and took the time to drive there and wait etc, only to find out that was not necessary. Now it is necessary because the phone doesn't function correctly. Hopefully once that is done it will be fine.Facial recognition does not work as well as I had thought it would. I will probably erase and try again but it consistently does not recognize my face. I did try to put a screen protector on and I adjusted the touch sensitivity but the phone still did not recognize a touch so I had to take that off. I'm a little nervous about having a screen without a protectorI am a Samsung Galaxy lover, I have the s4, the s5, and the s9. I stuck with the s20 because it has the SD card slot.

I really didn't expect it to be this nice, knowing it was priced below $100. If you are wondering where they saved the money, I'm thinking it's the camera but let's talk about it.Presentation: It arrived well-packaged with the battery charged at 98% so I didn't have to wait to set it up.Quality: I was pretty blown away but the solid, high-quality feel and appearance of the phone. The slightly opalized, matte-finish of the back of the phone is just beautifully done. The camera optics are not expensive, so it won't be as good as an iPhone, but they're not terrible either - certainly well-worth the price point. The camera software is really nice with lots of modes and options including a night mode and a pro mode. Not too shabby!Features I like: I LOVE that this came with a screen protector already installed - thank you! I also love that it came with a nice silicone case.Bottom line - Altogether, this phone is a truly outstanding value for the <$100 asking price. It's a great option if you are on a budget, want to use a different phone for business, or if you're looking for a decent phone for a teenager who will inevitably shatter and/or lose said phone.

It took a few minutes to turn itself on after I changed the setting.  It offers unlocking with face recognition as well as fingerprint, and both work well so far.

It seemed like a decent phone and not too expensive. Everything else on the phone worked as it should except for the service/data. When putting in a sim card it would not locate our carrier and not connect to data. It would show all the other info that is related to the sim card like the # on it. When trying to manually add a carrier no service provider would show, only thing it would show is raoming. We tried multiple sim cards too. At one point with a different sim card it showed something about at&t so we thought it could be locked into their network. I ended up doing some googling and came across a website called ""Direct Unlock"" and if you provide the imei number that belongs to the phone, you can pay to see if it\'s locked to a network. Paid $6 for that for it to tell us it\'s locked to a region, and that region was ""Open Mobile"" which is in Puerto Rico. We decided not to pay more money to see if it could get unlocked from that and just decided to return the phone and get a refund. Tried contacting the seller but they failed to respond. There seems to be other good reviews on here so it seems it\'s a hit or miss on if the phone you buy comes unlocked or not.

Came from an S9', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn\'t even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I\'m happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I\'m a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I\'ve watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I\'m not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don\'t recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I\'ve taken pictures of people and shown them, and they\'ve been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don\'t think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven\'t had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M Mullins', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Love love love! Best phone I've ever had! Came from an A series phone!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022', 'Review Body': ""My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'james gettle', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Like how easy to use.

Si questo perché non solo è praticamente super protetto e resistente a qualsiasi interperia ma è alquanto potente , infatti convince non solo nel design ma anche nell’hardware e nel software, insomma un buon compromesso tra potenza e prestazione.All\'interno della confezione troviamo:1- Lo smartphone con pellicola protettiva già applicata1- Alimentatore1- Cavo di ricarica/trasmissione dati type-c1- Estrattore sim1- garanzia e libretto d\'istruzioneUn prodotto con prezzo di fascia media ma con prestazioni premium adatto non solo a chi cerca uno smartphone indistruttibile e ben protetto ma anche\xa0 a chi cerca un dispositivo di qualità e di sostanza , infatti convince nell’hardware, nel software e anche nel design , tanto è vero che\xa0 esteticamente è molto bello , ben protetto in tutti i lati , una beckcover in policarbonato leggermente ruvido in modo che non c\'è rischio che lo smartphone possa scivolare dalle mani in caso fossero sudate o bagnate , inoltre\xa0 è ben assemblato oltre ad essere super protetto in tutti e 4 lati , infatti è resistente all\'acqua ,\xa0 resistente sia a basse temperature che ad alte temperature,\xa0 resistente agli urti , resistente alla polvere e resistente alle cadute accidentali,\xa0 questa scelta ha fatto sì che lo smartphone risultasse abbastanza pesante\xa0 in mano , ma comunque è un peso accettabile \xa0considerando che si tratta appunto di un rugged phone e tenendo in considerazione anche le dimensioni del display e della batteria oltre che il rivestimento protettivo.Per quanto riguarda il display monta un HD+ da 6,52 pollici in grado di restituire immagini vivide , buon bilanciamento cromatico ed è utilizzabile senza problemi anche sotto la luce diretta del sole. Nessun problema anche per quanto riguarda la visuale laterale ( su più fronti) , nessun riflesso , nessun effetto "" sbiadito""\xa0, i colori restano vividi e la visuale del display resta chiara e ben visibile. Inoltre ha\xa0 anche un trattamento oleofobico eccezionale , nel senso che non trattiene le impronte sul display , una caratteristica da non dare per scontata. Inoltre sono presenti anche diverse modalità di sblocco , oltre a quelle tradizionali,\xa0 vi è anche lo sblocco tramite riconoscimento facciale , che funziona una meraviglia,\xa0 in quanto la fotocamera frontale da 5 megapixel permette uno sblocco veloce e reattivo , per cui davvero molto funzionale , inoltre nel comparto fotografico vi è anche il sensore per lo sblocco tramite impronte digitali, anch\'esso molto funzionale e soprattutto reattivo.Per quanto riguarda il lato reparto imaging,\xa0 monta una fotocamera principale da 48 megapixel ad alta risoluzione\xa0 , che è una garanzia sia in condizioni di buona luce , sia quando l’illuminazione diventa critica. Un aiuto lo offre anche la stabilizzazione ottica dell’immagine, preziosa negli scatti notturni. Ho effettuato diversi scatti,\xa0 e vi assicuro che la fotocamera principale cattura tanta luce , restituendo così foto naturali , dettagliate e assolutamente non plasticose , mentre la fotocamera frontale è\xa0da 5 megapixel con che assicura buoni selfie il tutto ottimizzato dall\'ottimo AI integrato. I video vengono registrati ad alta risoluzione , garantendo un\'ottima qualità così come la stabilizzazione, ottima anche la velocità di messa a fuoco.Ma il punto forte dello smartphone è il processore,\xa0 infatti monta il T606 Octa Core con una frequenza di 2.3GHz con GPU integrata\xa0 , che permette di rendere lo smartphone veloce e mai titubante infatti il potente processore permette un rendering grafico rapidissimo e fluidissimo , il tutto ottimizzato dai 6 GB di memoria RAM e dai 256 GB di memoria interna ( espandibile tramite SDcard fino a 1T). Inoltre la GPU integrata rende lo smartphone ottimo anche per il gaming , comportandosi egregiamente anche con titoli di spessore che richiedono un framerate alto e stabile , non si può chiedere di più.Dedico qualche riga alla memoria RAM, viene indicato 24 GB di RAM , in effetti è così, questo perché 6GB sono installati direttamente sulla soc con la possibilità di aumentare la ram installata con ulteriori 18 GB di RAM virtuale, per un totale di 24 GB di RAM, operazione che consiglio vivamente , sarà poi il processore a regolare l\'utilizzo della RAM in base alle esigenze dello smartphone.Buona anche l’autonomia che con una batteria da 10600mAh permette di utilizzare per molto tempo lo smartphone anche con un uso intenso , personalmente lo ricarico una volta ogni 3 giorni , semplicemente perché lo utilizzo spesso e in modo intenso. Mentre se viene utilizzato in modo moderato l\'autonomia aumenta fino a 4 giorni senza essere ricaricato.Per quanto riguarda la connettività , troviamo\xa0il real dual sim ( due sim più micro sd) , 4g plus e LTE ,\xa0\xa0\xa0 Wifi , GPS, NFC\xa0 Bluetooth , OTG\xa0e slot per microSD card fino a 1T.Infine,\xa0 per quanto riguarda il software,\xa0 è installata la versione di Android 14 con patch di sicurezza aggiornate ( e che vi chiederà di aggiornare alla prima accensione) inoltre poiché lo smartphone è\xa0 nuovo alla prima accensione vi chiederà diversi aggiornamenti da fare , infine\xa0 per quanto riguarda l\'interfaccia utente,\xa0 resta intuitivo e user friendly.\xa0In conclusione penso che sia uno degli Smartphone più prestanti ed eccellenti nella fascia rugged medio-bassa\xa0 , in quanto vi è un\xa0ottimo equilibrio tra potenza e prestazione.Spero di esservi stato utile. 👋\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gorka', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on October 7, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nEl resultado de este Móvil rugerizado es bastante bueno , tiene una batería de muy larga duración , sobrado de RAM y rom y con reconocimiento facial , está preparado para mover cualquier aplicación por pesada que sea ya que tiene muy buenas prestaciones , va muy fluido y suena genial , este tipo de movil soporta muy bien los golpes y el agua , la pantalla se ve genial y es de muy buen tamaño de imagen para ver cualquier plataforma de streaming sin problema , me gusta mucho el chasis y los botones , que vienen muy bien protegidos .la memoria de 256gb no es fisica , sería de 12 GB así que hay que activar una opción para disfrutar de los 256gb de espacio virtual  , lleva android 14 que funciona realmente bien en este modelo , en definitiva el punto fuerte de este tipo de móviles es su batería que es eterna y el buen resultado que da para golpes y salpicaduras , eso sí  para hacerlo tan robusto le penalizaun poco  el peso aunque en pocos días te acostumbras .\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Oli', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on August 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es ist schon krass wie wenig Geld man ausgeben muss um ein Top Handy zu erhalten, dass sich hinter den iPhones nicht verstecken muss.

Except that every so often, a text message shows up that says ""not available"" and when I touch the download icon, it just spins forever.According to Visible Wireless, my Verizon MVNO, my specific phone is NOT COMPATIBLE with the Visible network.  This is because it is targeted for European markets; hence the European charger and U.S. adapter taped to the side of the phone.Turns out, it is almost nearly compatible except for problems with texting.

It was nothing like the smart phone I was used to, the ""Quick Start Guide"" and the ""About Your Phone"" were inadequate (to say the least) for someone like me who had never had a flip phone (I am an ""older adult"").TracFone tech support wasn\'t much help either.  First of all, there was the language barrier - I\'m guessing Tech Support was in India, and it was very difficult to understand the heavily-accented English (Note to Verizon/Tracfone:  try hiring native English speakers - you will save money in the long run, because it will take a fraction as long for a tech support phone call with someone that speaks native English).Secondly, tech support assumed that I knew how to navigate the phone (NOTHING on the ""different-kind"" of navigation used on this kind of phone in the aforementioned manuals), which I did not.  So that every thing they said I should try on the phone, I had no idea how to do.NOTE TO VERIZON/TRACFONE:  Understanding NAVIGATION on this phone is **KEY**.  If a person - like me - does not understand how to navigate on this phone, they got nothin\'.After 1 1/2 hours talking to tech support I was frustrated beyond belief, enraged even, I told the rep to cancel my TracFone subscription, because I was going to return this ##@@!!$$ phone.Two days later I had calmed down a bit, and realized that the TracFone subscription had NOT been cancelled, so - being in a calmer frame of mind - I decided to see if I could figure out this darn thing without benefit of tech support.PLUS I still needed a cheapo phone with a cheapo monthly access as an emergency backup to my regular smartphone.And. . . I DID finally figure it out.  Took me a bit, but I got \'er done.And - guess what - I think this phone will do just fine for what I need, which is mostly making telephone calls (remember those?), very little texts, very little web access.So I am upgrading my rating from one stars to four stars.  This phone ""is what it is"", which is not a smartphone.  But I don\'t need a second smart phone.I would go with five stars, except for the fact that information on how to navigate around on this phone is almost totally lacking in the manuals, and also because heavily-accented tech support was so difficult to understand.Some Kudos to tech support, though:  they were unfailingly courteous and polite, and patiently repeated what they had said - sometimes three or four times - until I could finally understand what they were saying.SO, in conclusion, I would say that this is probably a good emergency backup phone - if one has the patience to learn how to navigate around on it.______________________________________________________________________________________________I I should have believed the other reviews on this phone when I read them.  Instead, I ordered it.  It arrived, brand-new and shiny.To make a long story short, after ONE AND ONE HALF HOURS on the telephone with TracFone tech support (3 different tech support people!) tech support could not get this phone to work properly.  They said to turn it off for an hour, and then to turn it on again and try the same steps that had already been tried 10 times.Um. . . no.  Just no.  I was done.  Processed an Amazon return for this phone the very same day it was received.  One and one half hours gone from my life that I will never get back is MORE than enough.Save your money and buy something else.  You\'ll be glad you did.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kimberly G', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""3 months old, phone doesn't work anymore"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Bought in June 2023 for my elderly father who has always had Tracfone instead of a regular ""billed"" cellular service. This was to replace the ""Smart"" Tracfone that he lost, so we decided to go back to an old-fashioned flip phone like he had previously as the smartphone just wasn\'t a good fit and he felt he managed with his previous flip better because he thought it was easier to use. Plus, it was relatively inexpensive, this is his 4th phone in as many years (he loses them) so replacing cheaply is a plus.Well, I wouldn\'t put THIS flip phone anywhere in the easy-to-use category. It just didn\'t work ""logically."" He\'d make a call, close the phone to hang up and instead of it going back to a main menu it STAYED on the last call he made or received. Which is not a huge problem for us in the ""younger"" generations as we know how to navigate to the other menus, but an elderly man in his 80s just can\'t figure these things out. Initially I thought he was doing something wrong, but it wasn\'t user error, it is 100% how the phone functions. You must exit all the way out to the main menu each time you use the phone otherwise when you engage the phone next it opens right up to wherever you were last. None of the menus seemed ""easy"" to get to. There is no ""home"" type key so it\'s a matter of backing out multiple times to get to ""the beginning"" again. Maybe I\'ve had a smartphone for too long and I don\'t remember this kind of difficulty going back to the analog days. But then I started to think there WAS something wrong with the phone in general when it just seemed to get stuck in particular menus and the only way to get out was to force a restart.Fast forward to September 2023, he asks me to come look at his phone (a weekly occurrence in the last few years) because ""It\'s just not working."" He\'s complaining because the small outside screen on the flip will not ""turn off."" So I look at it and he\'s right, the outside screen was staying ""on"" instead of timing out when inactive.  So I start looking through the menus to see if there is a time out setting for that screen that may have ""mysteriously"" been changed. I can\'t find anyway to adjust that particular feature. So I figured I would power it all the way off then back on thinking maybe it would reset. I can\'t power it off at all. The ""red"" button won\'t engage at all to force the restart. Strike one. So I start checking other things I grab my own cell and call his number, it never rings and he gets a notice of a missed call. And not that it\'s on silent or vibrate, the phone never indicates an incoming call just the immediate indication of a missed call. Strike two. So I try to make a call FROM his phone, it tells me it is unable to connect the call. I try to call 611 to connect to Tracfone support, tells me it is unable to make a call. I reset the network. Still says it\'s unable to connect the call. Strike three. The man literally keeps this phone in his chest pocket on his shirt or on his nightstand. It hasn\'t gotten wet or been dropped or used beyond calling his lady-friend 5 times a day. It\'s all but brand-new and ""dead"" already.So this phone is three months old, nothing but a useless paperweight now, and I\'m stuck looking for another easy to use phone for my father. This is a exercise in futility in today\'s world because ""easy to use"" is subjective.I will not buy this one again and would advise anyone against buying it if looking for a reliable and easy to use phone, particularly for an elderly person. We are stuck with Tracfone now because he paid for a whole year of airtime up front and they don\'t prorate/reimburse if you ""cancel."" Which is bad business. Stay away from from this phone, honestly I\'d say stay away from Tracfone in general.  Further, the multiple times I have had to get on the phone with my father to Tracfone in the last few years is a struggle, customer service is ""overseas"" and difficult for him to deal with (language and hearing issues and the lack of the CSR understaning that they are dealing with an older person who is not ""tech savvy"").Get your grandparents a Jitterbug or the ""Alzheimers"" phone.\nRead more'}]",,B09X7F2GCG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09X7F2GCG,4g

This new Razr has all the benefits of it's folding predecessor, while sporting an amazing assignment is improvements that make it superior in every way.- my old Razr' Achilles heel was it's tiny 2800mah battery; it was as bad as an Apple, requiring a charge every few hours, and getting worse as it aged.

No slips, no fingerprints, no back glass shattered.The 2020 was fast, but this thing, with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1, is screaming fast, over 660kb on Antutu!- both have a super high quality feel, crazy good looks, and the benefits of the foldable design cannot be overstated. It just ROCKS.- Better colors. Mine is the super lavender/purple, looks terrific.Highest recommendation.** Update ** after two months, just about everything above still holds, only one negative/ caveat to add: in two months of heavy daily use, I have pinched my index finger twice upon opening. Ouch! In two years of ownership, that never happened once with the old Razr.

No issues at all. Thanks guys! (F.Y.I.) Edit, BE VERY CAREFUL WHO THE SELLER IS WHEN PURCHASING!! The reason say this, is that I bought this phone the first time everything with it was perfect I still have no issues with it at all it functions how it should. So I decide to buy it again for my mom for her birthday. This one I bought from a different seller that had it a little bit cheaper, when I got it I first looked at the phone before giving it to my mom. It had came with a lock on it called a google FRP lock. This lock is on because the tech left there google account login when it was reset. I had to make a decision to refund it or figure it out myself. So with a little research I figured out how to remove it legally. There are programs for removing it, you cannot go to a Repair store because they will over charge or wont do it because the amazon receipt doesn't have your name and Phone MIEI number on it. Use Tenorshare's its the first googled one the others work to but this one is ridiculously easy to do. After that you'll have to pay unfortunately for a registration License for the cheapest is $20 its worth it. This process is worth it better than sending it back and deal with a loss of anyway.Also there are NO repercussions from unlocking the FRP yourself. It will NOT blacklist the phone unless it has been clamed lost or stolen then the phone was already blacklisted(don't let anyone even a repair tech tell you different, they are lying, trust me, I have been lied to by many of them, and found out myself they were wrong) and then amazon WILL compensate you but don't mention unlocking the FRP if you do have to send it back they may not refund you at all even if it was sent to you faulty. I even talked to samsung they are okay with what I'm saying but they told me to mention I'm not telling you to do this just giving a option that nobody tells you.

It actually appears to be in new condition. It came with the OEM charger and cable. That's a first for me and I've been purchasing my cell phones second hand for years.I downgraded from a Samsung Note 8. There is no Samsung Note 8 or above that you can get for under $100, so your only choice will be the Moto G Stylus 2022 (4G). The sensitivity of the stylus is worse on the Moto G Stylus, but you still can take notes. The note app itself is simple. The camera is decent and you can take better night photos with the night vision option in the camera app. The rear camera is 50mp, but there is no image stabilization. You get the same amount of RAM - 6GB and more storage - 128GB than on the base Note 8 (6GB ram, 64GB storage). The phone is fast enough for your tasks and handles basic games well too.So far so good. The phone has crashed once, but it could be a software conflict. I will try to come back and do an update in the future.If you are on a budget and need a replacement for your Samsung Galaxy Note series, this is a decent phone.Update: 3/6/24 - I've had this phone now for a while. No new crashes thankfully. I'm almost certain it was some kind of app conflict. The battery doesn't last two days as advertised, but not a problem for me. It will last for a day with heavy use (Watching videos for example). I didn't mention sound. It's good. I don't think it's like on the flagship phones, but there is Dolby Atmos if you plug in headphones. It actually has a jack. I'm not sure what else to add. The display is good. No, it's not like a high end oled phone, but that's not a big thing. I like the IPS LCD. It is more than adequate. The colors seem very realistic. I don't use saturated colors, but if that's your thing the option is avaliable. You can also select the color temperature.

This was a $300 phone! My trusty note 5 was a wonder for the 7 years it lasted. Android system stopped updating at android 7. Storage was only 32 GB/4 ram memory which was probably a lot 7 years ago. The battery started draining faster and it kept rebooting itself frequently. No troubleshooting fixed it. The moto g stylus does almost everything the note 5 did but not as well. Almost everything involves using Google account. Had to navigate numerous settings to get to what I like. Face recognition is really great but only works half the time so I use pin as finger print set up did not like my dry skin fingers. The chop, chop gesture for flash light was cool but stopped working after several uses. Mostly wanted another stylus as I use for on the fly notes. Pen is NOT as good as Samsungs but better than nothing. Everything transferred over via Google account. Only Samsung notes and pictures of my contacts flowed over. I have not yet found a way to connect a photo to my contacts which uses google. One thing I don't like is it mixes my Alexa reminders with text messages. Not separated like samsung. To its advantage it has a bigger battery which lasts longer but..no fast charging. Limited to 10 watt charger. No wireless charging but it does have SD card for extra storage and headphone jack which many higher end phones are doing away with. If you know what you need and do your research, this phone is a great value. It will not get updates for 5 years like Samsung phones but cost so much less and meets my needs.

They usually have a good price/performance ratio, okay reliability, and low levels of bloat with a mostly stock Android experience. This phone does everything I need it to, and does it pretty quickly thanks to the 6GB RAM. The relatively large internal storage also means that I shouldn\'t really have to offload stuff, other than maybe photos/videos, to an SD card.All the basic features work pretty well. Good reception, decent speaker, fast GPS, etc. Very few real complaints with this phone. Battery life is just okay. I used to have an older G Power with a massive battery, with a very long battery life. This G Stylus still has good enough battery life, especially if you ""trim the fat"" a bit, app-wise, and listen to music more often than watching HD videos. Days where I spend a lot of time watching stuff often leave me with 10-20% battery by bed time.However, nothing really stands out as amazing about it. I\'ve never owned a flagship phone, so I don\'t know if there\'s some magical experience there, but this Moto phone is perfectly adequate for basically everything other than maybe extreme graphics applications/gaming. It\'s a great deal at under $200, in my opinion.Now if Moto/Lenovo would just make their phones easily serviceable, I\'d wholeheartedly recommend them. Planned obsolescence sucks. Just make the USB-C port and the battery replaceable and I\'d sing Moto\'s praises to the world.Did you know that officially the USB C port is actually rated for fewer insertions than Micro USB? Sure, that\'s partly a limitation of making it reversible (more pins in a similar form factor) but it also means, gee golly, our phones will break even faster. I wonder why the standard was adopted so quickly? It\'s too bad that phones are essentially expensive disposable toys these days.Basically, this Moto phone is me making the best of a bad situation.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'policarpo linan', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on August 26, 2023', 'Review Body': 'caja origina con su sello intacto!,cargador turbo original.version global que funciona con cualquier compañia de mexico y de cualquier pais!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Carlos', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Singapore on February 5, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This phone is fantastic value for money.Can't go wrong for a 4G phone.Get it...\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Anthony', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Australia on July 14, 2023', 'Review Body': 'I like all the features the phone offers, in particular the 48 mega pix camera.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rafael Bustamante García', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 30, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Ya tengo varios meses de usarlo y no me ha fallado.

Better alternatives', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2023', 'Review Body': ""As a Handset Enthusiast, I find hard to hold the BLU G33 in high regard. The hard-specs are lacking, with only 2GB of RAM, the BLU G33 is going to be slow & incompetent at performing multiple tasks at once. The 16GB of Storage is tolerable, but due to the inability to format Micro SD Cards as internal storage, you're restricted on how many apps you can have on the G33. The Outward Camera & Inward Camera are capable of taking comprehendable photos, but they are certainly low quality & grainy in resolution. The Software is modern by 2023 Standards, running Android 13 Go Edition, one can expect a clean interface, albeit choppy & slow. The IPS LCD display/screen is clear, with very acceptable viewing angles, but don't expect it to be crisp & high quality.BLU has always done a good job including accessories with their unlocked handset devices, the G33 does not disappoint. The clear TPU case is sufficient & charging equipment are included unlike modern big label phone manufacturers. Although not mentioned, the G33 comes with a pre-installed Screen Protector, albeit a cheap plastic film instead of the tempered glass ones they include with their high price models.The G33 is a usable phone & built quite nicely, solid in the hands with nice heft. Yet unfortunately, due to it's internal hardware, using this device will require patience as it is slow in almost every aspect. If you MUST have a phone/handset cheaper than $100 USD with modern features such as Type-C charging & Android 13, this can be the device for you. But there are better options for your money if you are willing to use an older version of Android & Micro-USB charging. Even BLU themselves makes better alternatives to the G33, if you are willing to pay $20-$30 USD more, you can acquire the BLU G61S or BLU S91 which are slightly older but better performing handsets. The compromise with these phones is the fact they run Android 11 & will not be supported in terms of software updates, therefore may feel less modern.In the end, the G33 is a modern but slow phone, it is usable with patience, performing basic smartphone features. There are just some better options if you are willing to spend slightly more for a more enjoyable user experience.Edit: Spelling Typos.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rubeneast', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""It works so well it's the best cell phone that I ever had."", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Nothing it works perfect at all times\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fatimadlc', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'STOP WORKING!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Phone is not loading, stop working, i thought was a battery problem but not it simply doesn't start. bad quality phone\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Greatness', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Terribel product, only worked for one day!

After reviewing my choices in lower cost phones, I decided to buy this renewed Samsung A32 5G.  I\'m not going to go into a lot of detail about the features on this phone because you can find video reviews on YouTube for that.  I\'ll say that at this price level you will be hard pressed to find a phone with so many features, especially one that is just two years old.  Oddly enough, the 4G version of this phone (simply called the A32) has lenses with a higher resolution that this one, but I think 48MP resolution is pretty good, and a definite improvement over my previous phone.  The fingerprint scanner built into the side button is a nice way of unlocking your phone.  I requested a phone that was in ""excellent"" condition, and that was what I got, with absolutely no visible marks or damage to either the case or the screen.  I use T-Mobile (prepaid) for my carrier, and I was able to take the SIM card out of my old phone and put it into this one and use the phone right away without any issues.

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I\'m happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they\'re not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I\'m committed to the new phone, don\'t want to lose it, but don\'t want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I\'ll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don\'t run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it\'s all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here\'s the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it\'s good, we\'ll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I\'m no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Eric Sullivan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Too easy…', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'On my journey of ordering a refurbished iPhone and it can be a journey this was an excellent purchase.  Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Joshua A.

I paired it with a case (ASIN: B0BR6ZBQGD) and have been very happy with it. Honestly, I like the compact size relative to my previous Galaxy A12 more, and while downgrades in terms of the smaller battery, slower charging, missing Samsung apps, and lower resolution camera are noticeable, I don't really mind them, since all the essential features for me are still present in this phone and all my apps and contacts were easy to transfer over.UPDATE (September 2023): I work a rough and dirty job, and an accumulation of dried mud in the charging port eventually rotted out the silicon component of the micro usb, meaning the phone could no longer be charged. I might attempt some hobbyist electronic repairs on it down the line, but for now I decided to shell out the money for a rugged military-grade phone with wireless charging capacity as a replacement.

On my WiFi I'm easily getting full 500 mbps through two walls.

After looking at some benchmarks though, I was comfortable enough to switch and I have to say that I am very impressed with the speed and functionality of this phone. It is super sleek, very responsive, the UI is quick, and it's got a TON of AI features. The best way to go about this is to give some context to each feature on the product page so here goes.AI: The AI abilities on this phone are nothing short of incredible. Photo Assist is incredible. I thought I took great photos with my android phones, but enhancing each photo brings them to the next level. The instant slow mo is also amazing. Using your video, it instantly slows the video down simply by holding the screen. Searching with google by circling what you're looking for, my mind is blown. It is surprisingly precise. I don't really have a need for translation in my everyday life, but if I ever do, I'm eager to test it out.Physical Specs: The specs are awesome on this phone, at 120Hz and a 6.7 inch display, the screen itself looks amazing and videos look amazing as well. I was a little apprehensive to get a phone that didn't use a Qualcomm chip, but this chip is certainly faster than what is in the S22+ I was using before. AI functions are easy. Pictures and video look awesome as mentioned before, assisted by Photo Assist of course. The cameras can capture up to 8K video, that's crazy! I personally think that the sweet spot is 1080P/60FPS between quality, smoothness, and storage.There's a ton of other things to go over, but these are the ones that stuck out to me. My only negative is that Samsung took away SD card storage. Samsung, bring it back!Overall, this is an awesome phone for anyone looking for a mid-range phone that feels like a premium flagship.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'A.

The weigh feels great. Quality build but not too heavy or big.  Same size at s24 plus and weigh feels same in hand but a little more rounded and comfortable.  The haptic feed back is the best I have ever seen.  And it is integrated everywhere in the os. Super awwsome experience.  I can type like a pro on this better than iPhone due to the haptics and keyboard smarts.  The os is great no duplicate Samsung apps and confusion with Samsung  account etc.  that can lead into a hot mess.  the speakers in this blow Samsung's out of the water.  a perfect balanced sound with bass.  Not tinny like Samsung.  Speakerphone actually works well.  Build quality is apple level.  Screen is stunning.  And the CAMERA.  Rank #2 in all mobile cameras.  See Dxo reviews.  Yes iPhone 16 pro is ranked below this.  No shutter lag like the samsungs.  It just knows how to take the picture Everytime.

So far I am very happy with the phone. It replaced a Sony Xperia 1III, but as Sony was not releasing the latest version of their flagship in the US, I was happy to give the Pixel a look. I see no negatives thus far, and will update my review with more use. So this review is after a only few days of use, and coming from Sony.Set up was SEAMLESS, copied everything over from my old phone, just up to me to set up as I want it. The screen is amazing. Super bright and contrasty. The software is excellent, very clean version of Android.For me, the camera on a phone is very important and this one has not disappointed, at least in the very limited use I have put it through. Have used the add me feature, and it worked very well. Macro focus is an outstanding feature and one I will use frequently for close-ups. Telephoto images are bit soft, but I would love to use it with some kind of stability (tri or monopod) to see if the softness is due to user movement rather than lens quality. I miss the Sony software as it really feels like you are using an SLR camera in a phone. So I am in a bit of a learning curve here. But getting there quickly. I look forward to exploring and learning more of the camera software/hardware.Charging lasted easily over a day with very heavy use. Charge with the 45w Google charge ""brick"" was 5% to 75% in 45 minutes. Not bad at all. I have found the speed of the phone to be quick and responsive. Of all the devices in my house (computers, iPads, phones, etc), this has by FAR has the fastest Speedtest results on our home wifi. I mean it is not even close! Face and fingerprint recognition has been flawless.A lot of reviewers out there have talked about build quality and aesthetic. I remember handling an earlier pixel (no idea which model, maybe 4 years ago?) and thought it felt lightweight and ""toylike."" That is NOT the case here. The phone is gorgeous and substantive in design and feel. Coming from the Sony 1 III the phone does not feel too big, nor heavy.For these reasons, I give 5 stars.\nRead more'}]",,B0D7HWR5QG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D7HWR5QG,5g

Since then I have had waves of negative experiences with the software on the phone, and today capped it off with something that defies logic.When first setting the phone up, I was informed my PIN was too weak, and now needed to be 8 digits long. Alright, a bit weird but I can handle it. Then it maxed out at 3 fingerprints instead of my previous phone's 5, which has caused me minor grief because I've found that the fingers I chose to forego, index and thumb on my left hand, I actually used a fair bit more than I realized.Next up was the One+ UI, a disaster of an interface that took me hours to figure out how to bypass in favor of my typical layout. This comes packaged with an obscene amount of bloatware, and there's a hardware-based warranty void if you attempt to root to remove any of those apps, which I will never use and only take up space on the device. Fine, whatever, I'll adapt.Then it decided it wasn't going to connect to my PC with a transfer protocol, choosing only to charge itself from the connection. This was the first major issue with the phone, as I frequently moved files between my PC and previous phone and now am unable to do so directly, making file management a pain. There was one option I had left to work around this, a thumb drive with USB-A on one side and USB-C on the other, so I could connect it to my PC, drop desired files onto it, then connect it to the phone and offload them. A pain, but a workaround for the time being.And then it decided it didn't want to do mobile data after disconnecting from a Wi-Fi signal, requiring a full reboot to register that, yes, I do in fact pay a significant amount extra on my mobile plan for unlimited data and it should be using that. This would reproduce every time I disconnected from a Wi-Fi signal, until finally I opened the developer options and forced it to keep mobile data on even when on Wi-Fi.And then today I noticed the thing that finally bothered me enough to say something. I was transferring an album to the phone and happened to check the notifications pane, and it said it was charging the connected USB device. Let me repeat that: it was CHARGING A FLASH DRIVE. The drive was concerningly warm, and there was no way to disable it as the USB settings were apparently controlled by said flash drive. I checked online for any sort of solution or workaround, and found that this has apparently been the case since at least 2017 and Samsung has done nothing about it. This absurd misunderstanding of basic hardware is so far beyond what any QA should have caught, and if it's been part and parcel of Samsung devices for SEVEN YEARS then I'm done with Samsung's ecosystem. Y'all can keep your bloatware and atrocious programming; see how many customers it wins you.Editing this review on account of new developments; I now have grounds to take off the last pity star I was willing to give. The phone has started refusing to recognize its mobile data as an option every time it connects to Wi-Fi. I went so far as to order a new SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the symptoms have started to recognize on the new card as well. Given that I use this phone for work on the go, this is absolutely unacceptable. One star, fix your useless OS.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'mike dewitt', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Came on time\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Bulky and slow, but very cheap!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023', 'Review Body': ""This is a decent budget phone, but I really wish I spent a bit more and got something thinner (check the measurements!!!), smaller, and with more performance.

My last phone was a BLU F91 5G, which if it was still available I would have just bought another.  I can\'t reconcile mentally why there is no wireless charging.  Seriously, all the reasonably priced options don\'t have it any longer.  The only reason I ""upgraded"" was because the battery in my old phone got hot enough to off gas and blow the back of the case off on my old phone so I did not have a ton of time to wait around looking for a new phone.I have been using this phone for a week and here are all the things I have noticed so far.1. It does have a dual sim card slot, but an odd one.  Its on the bottom of the phone, and very difficult to get out even with the tool they provided, it took a bit of a hook to get it out.  Its thicker than usual and the sim card kind of snaps in, because its double sided.  You put one card facing out on the top and bottom, new to me after having dozens of phones.  Nowhere could I find if it was dual sim in the documentation (Sim1 is on top).2. Its big enough storage to justify not having an SD card slot.  I know nobody is doing it these days, but I have had more phones die than SD cards and a good waterproof SD card can save the day if you have a whole trips worth of pictures on the phone when you dunk it hard enough to kill the phone.  But, with 256GB its got enough storage for all my MP3\'s and lots of pictures (I travel a lot and am on the water often where I have no service but want to be able to have music on board) plus all my apps.  There was a bunch of unnecessary bloatware but not terrible and it was easy to clean up.  I am at 41% used before I start taking pictures so its a bit dicey for long term usage.3. The onboard storage is slow.  Unbearably slow.  Transferring my files from my Windows or Unix PC was maddeningly slow, regardless of USB cable or which port I used.  These are the same devices and cables I use for my old phone as well as an even older BLU G91 Pro and they are both 100 times faster to copy files over USB either to the SD card or the internal storage.  It was so slow and unusable that I had to try multiple cables and ports before giving up on moving my MP3\'s over by USB and installing an FTP client on my phone.  That was the only way I could move anything more than a few small files on or off the phone.  Its something that I can overcome but its maddening.4. It came with a screen protector on it.  Its good because there are not a lot of options yet, but I didn\'t see that anywhere.5. The case it comes with is laughable and there are not many options currently and you never know if there ever will be.  Honestly for this to be in the Bold line and not have a better case than this is a bit odd.  My last 2 phones had the black lightly armored cases that were good enough not to need an upgrade, this one is going back a few years and its a throw away if you can find something better.  The first one I have tried doesn\'t even come close to having the right openings for this phone even if it fits the general form factor and camera lens so if you need a decent case maybe this is not the right phone for you.6. The fingerprint scanner is adequate but not great.  Its in the screen which is the new hottness, but it doesn\'t work as well as my last several low end phones.  I have 7 or 8 fingerprints registered to try and help my two fingers work but I have to hold it just right to get it to unlock.  It works and I am getting used to it but the back panel and power button scanners both work better for me.7. Battery life is fantastic and it charges well.  It does take a bit more power to do a fast charge but it is very fast and the battery easily lasts me all day.  No complaints at all, other than damn I wish it had wireless charging, I mean its 2024 and many, many cars have wireless charging and it would be great to be able to use it. I know it adds heat and I wouldn\'t really use it in the summer and its not that fast but if you are driving its nice to just keep it topped off if you don\'t want to deal with wires.8. The screen is just lovely.  I really should have lead with this.  its the nicest looking screen I have every used, and its very bright and very clear.  It is so easy to read I might be in the market for a second one because my wife\'s phone screen is terrible compared to this one.9. Its fast enough most of the time.  Fastest phone I have ever had, very responsive nearly all the time.  The ram is plenty for an old dude who has way to much open and way to many notifications all the time. The only thing slow so far is the camera, and I wonder if its because the storage is slow.  That sucks for me, I have missed several candid shots already and experience has told me this is as fast as the phone will get. I am going to have to slow down myself and see if lowering the resolution will help but as of now the shutter speed is slow enough I have taken several pictures of my feet.  I have only taken few a dozen pictures and a couple videos, and while they look really really good on the screen I haven\'t tried them on a big screen yet.  The camera would also benefit from some form of stabilization but it works well enough for the price point from a quality standpoint.Overall its a good phone, I wish it had a decent case, and faster camera and storage.  It wouldn\'t hurt to have an SD card slot.  It still sucks to not have wireless charging.  I hope BLU brings that one back.  Its a great phone to look at and feels good in my hand and for the price its very good.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'tien phan', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very nice phone but two problems', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is a very nice phone in quality, screen Super AMOLED.

I took it to Europe and back, dropped it a gazillion times, the back battery is exposed in one corner, and yet it still works today.My second and third phone where Moto G Power 2020 and 2021. They are just too heavy. I drop one face first, cracked the screen too hard that I can\'t safely touch it. The other one is still working today but stutters like crazy.My forth phone is Moto G Pure. This phone is pure garbage. Once I synced up all my apps it runs slower than a PS2. Absolute trash of a phone that should have not been release.That brings me up to this phone, the G14. I\'ve owned it for 2 days, transferred all my apps, so far so good.The key points that make this a good purchase,1. It is $130 bucks. If you buy an iPhone or flagship android, you are easily spending 10 times this amount. Now with your $1000 phone, you got to add a case to protect it, maybe you add a screen protector too. Now your phone is 2 milimeters thicker, which probably makes it bigger than this phone.2. It looks like a shanzhaied iPhone 11. Shan Zhai means mountain fortress which just sounds very cool. If people ask you what phone it is, you can say it is motorola and they will go oh, I haven\'t heard that names in years.3. It\'s got 2 Sim slots and a SD card slot. You heard that right, you can combine 2 numbers and add gigabytes of storage into this baby.4. If you shop online with this phone, the seller will data mine your phone and give you better prices because it thinks you are poor.5. It is MOTOROLA. Do you remember the days when you heard that ring ""toon dee deet do doot Hallo Moto"". Well it is on this very phone so you can feel like when you were using razer back in the early 2000s.6. It is a hundred thirt bucks man. If you dropped this phone, or lost it, just buy another one.7.

Here's the review with a bullet-point summary of each critique added at the end:---The Blu Bold K10 phone has proven to be a solid choice for my needs, earning a commendable 4-star rating from me.This phone offers 4G connectivity, ensuring reliable and fast internet access. One of the standout features is its beautiful display, which provides vibrant and sharp visuals. The inclusion of a screen protector and case cover is a thoughtful addition, offering immediate protection right out of the box. Priced at just $99.00, the Bold K10 delivers impressive value for money.The phone boasts a generous 128GB of storage, with the option to expand it by an additional 128GB using the dual SIM and memory tray. This flexibility is particularly useful for managing both personal and professional communications.However, the phone does have a few drawbacks. The absence of NFC means no Google Wallet support for tap purchases, and the phone can sometimes take a long time to boot up. Additionally, it only offers 16 setting features compared to the 26 on my old phone, and the resolution and screen alignment can be off-center when switching between portrait and landscape modes. The volume isn't as high as desired, and hacks to increase it are suppressed.Despite these minor issues, the Blu Bold K10 meets my current needs effectively. I'm comfortable using this phone until I decide to upgrade to a more fully featured model. Overall, the Bold K10 is a reliable and cost-effective option that I would recommend to those looking for a budget-friendly smartphone with ample storage and a beautiful display.Critique Summary:- Sometimes takes a long time to boot up.- No NFC feature, so no Google Wallet/tap purchases.- Only 16 setting features compared to 26 on my old phone. The Motorola 5G Stylus is a lackluster phone  and in many ways the Blu Bold K10vhas several superior features.- Resolution and screen alignment issues in portrait vs. landscape mode.- Volume is not great and cannot be increased due to suppression of hacks.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Geoff Tate', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Won't connect to 4g network"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It won't connect to 4 g network and the battery life is rubbish\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Raildig', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very Poor Battery Life, Glitches, Nasty Sound', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I recently bought a pair of the BLU View 5 phones for use as Wi-Fi devices around the house instead of cheap tablets, and have been very surprised at how good they are for the price.

The phone was not unlocked as the seller claimed in the description. Also the phone was not a refurbished phone.Upon booting the phone it was not fully charged, where it already had an account on the phone.  The seller claimed the phone was unlocked, however, the phone booted with t-mobile software and was not factory reset.This prompted me to reach out to Samsung to confirm if the phone was unlocked or not where I was told by the rep after providing the IMEI information that the phone is locked to T-mobile carrier.I next contacted t-mobile and the rep stated that the phone is not eligible to be unlocked, which rendered the phone unusable.This ordeal has been a huge inconvenience due to the fact I spent money on the phone with guarantee it would be unlocked and working.The seller had responsibility to ensure the phone was wiped of all previous user data, as well as ensuring the phone was not restricted to any carrier.  If so, I would not be writing my review to warn others.I should not have had to go through so many hoops to confirm the validity of the phone when the phone should have been in the \'unlocked condition\' as described on Amazon.I am recommending that AMAZON put in place a system that requires the SELLER to verify that the phone is unlocked by loading IMEI info before we as the CUSTOMER complete the purchase to prevent this from reoccurring.I have reached out to the seller to resolve this issue and have sent the phone back to receive a full refund.This experience has made me question Amazon\'s standards in regards to electronics where I do not have confidence or faith in purchasing any phone that is claimed to be unlocked from its Amazon sellers.  Not until Amazon can guarantee that sellers will be true to their listings.In addition, the seller should be more mindful and considerate of the phones they are selling to people as we are spending real money and trusting that they will send us a phone that works and is truly unlocked with no restrictions as described.Please be aware of the risks you are taking when purchasing a ""refurbished"" or ""renewed"" phone from Amazon as you may not recieve the item as it is described on Amazon.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'alias4jazz', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Things I know now and wished I knew before re Samsung Note20 Ultra purchase on Amazon', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023', 'Review Body': ""So I bought a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra via Amazon on 4/30/23. This was my first refurbished phone purchase and I was unsure of how it would turn out. Why? Because the reviews were sufficiently mixed with happy people and people who received less than what they ordered. Amazon is great for returns if the item is faulty, so that's why I bought here.In short, I wanted an android phone with a pen, and the ability to add in my own memory card. This is the last Note with the option to add memory. I read lots of reviews on this model and while it's not perfect, it fit the bill for me. Overall reviews were good on Amazon. Yet there are an abundance of sellers with varying performance ratings, while the reviews are gathered all together. Add to that many of the listings said condition would be excellent or good or whatever, but didn't indicate which condition I would receive. Also prices vary between listings. Not a whole bunch, but there are differences. So I kept looking.Ultimately I found a listing that stated the condition I wanted (I went for excellent). But here's where it gets interesting -- to the right of your webpage, under checkout, lists the name of the refurbishing provider with a hyperlink. I often check this before I buy because the provider's background informs me how they do business. If they have many complaints. Or if they're located out of the USA. In my case, the company was located in Colorado and they had sold a number of phones, most with positive reviews. So I went with them. Here's their name, just in case you're interested: Macalegin Electronics, LLC. Fort Collins, CO.My phone arrived timely. It was well-packed and included a SIM release tool, charger plug-in and wire. The plug-in was, or at least looked, new and OEM. The cord was iffy, so I used my own. They work well together. The phone looked like new. No scratches I could find, charged quickly, and at the time of this writing works problem-free. I also bought a camera scratch protector and case from Spigen (thru Amazon) and both arrived directly from the manufacturer. I am a happy camper.I have 90 days to test this unit. If anything goes wrong I'll edit my posting. I highly recommend this provider.My suggestions are to make sure the listing you're buying from promises you the condition you want. Also check to see who or what business is providing it to you and how they deal with returns and/or complaints. It just makes like easier.

Awesome.  If you are looking for a phone straight out of 2005 that you can use on today\'s networks, this one is it.  It doesn\'t lag.  It not some Kai-os sudo-android interface running on slow hardware causing lagging and crashing.  It\'s a true dumb phone.  The software feels like a true dumb phone.  But it also has a few tricks up it\'s sleeve:- Bluetooth- Dual Sims- Calculator- Flashlight- Micro-SD card slot- Something like 32mb of onboard storage- Plays Mp3\'s.  They can play in the background, so you can have music going while texting someone.  Yes, this WORKS WITH BLUETOOTH headphones or your car, and yes, it actually sounds good.  Play them off the tiny internal memory or a Micro-SD card.  You can also plug the USB cable it comes with from the phone to your computer and access both the Micro-SD card slot and the phone\'s internal memory as separate drives.  So you don\'t need a Micro-SD card reader on your computer.- FM Radio (doesn\'t work with bluetooth headphones for some reason, but you can play it through the speakerphone)- Upload your own ringtones and notification sounds.  You can store them on the Micro-SD card or the internal memory.- Camera.  It\'s garbage.  Even by early 2000\'s standards its garbage.  But it does exist, you can send and receive pictures, store them internally, upload them to your computer through USB, etc.  I don\'t plan on using it, but if my wife wants to send me a picture of something, at least i can see it.  You kind of need a camera phone to do that with.  Non-camera dumb phones typically don\'t receive pictures of have screens capable of rendering pictures.  This one will do it.It is a little big and cheap feeling, but I don\'t think dropping it will break it.  It has kind of that ""jitterbug"" old people phone aesthetic more in real life than in the pictures.  But as a millennial who\'s first cellphone was a Kyocera K7 Rave running on Virgin Mobile for 25 cents per minute, this phone has my approval as an official dumb-phone if you\'re trying to take your life back from phone addiction.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Customer', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Terrible product.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This phone is not very good.

Playing the radio or MP3s ate up the battery quickly, so I didn’t use it, but I tested it for the team. :-).One feature I constantly use is the cool flashlight. This is a dedicated flashlight, not just a backlight screen masquerading as a flashlight. It is a bright LED, and being on the top of the phone, it points very naturally.At 115g, the phone fits in any pocket.The AGM has two SIM slots, which are ideal for travelling. The battery is removable and easily swapped. Spare batteries cost less than $20, and replacing the battery takes less than five minutes. The phone is loud, the LED screen bright, and the buttons large with a tactile click.I live in an area with poor cell reception, and the AGM works well making and receiving calls. Texting is possible with the numerical keypad.There’s a calendar, calculator, and camera—all basic but all working.A fast charger and a USB C cable are included in the box, and the manual is easy for even a boomer like me to understand! :-)A basic phone has much to recommend it. They are very affordable and less prone to damage than a smartphone. The AGM can go three days between charges, and an old battery doesn’t require expensive service work to be fixed. A basic phone also carries less personal and financial data than most smartphones.With an IP68 rating, it is waterproof and dustproof, so makes a perfect work phone.In conclusion, the AGM M9 is a rugged phone with easy-to-use features.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The best basic phone ever.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Good product with large buttons, speaker volume and simple menu options with rugged construction.

Darunter z. B. den „Nörgler“, wenn nur eine Funktion oder Kleinigkeit abweicht oder nicht seinen persönlichen Vorstellungen entspricht, ist das ganze Produkt „Schrott“. Dann gibt es natürlich auch noch den „Lobpreisenden“, alles ist toll, das Produkt kann quasi alles. Seine Euphorie steht über allem und es gibt stets volle Punktzahl.Welcher „Rezensionist“ bin ich?

There are so many things they could have done to make phone calling easier.  This is actually better than other flip phones, but not as much as hoped for.  I\'d suggest they make the call menu top priority for the phone, scroll down and have the contact names right there, then press okay and it immediately calls that contact.

It’s hard to set up and the results leave something to be desired.First you have to link your Lively and Amazon accounts which is understandable, but then you have to add the Lively ‘skill’ to Alexa on this device.The big disappointment is that even after jumping through the hoops to successfully set it up you can’t say, “Alexa, call Tommy.”  You have to say, “Alexa, ask Lively to call Tommy.”  My father in law is having the darnedest time remembering that or even pronouncing the new words for him “Alexa”, “ask”, and “Lively.” You can’t deviate, you have to nail it! Apparently he never uses the word ask it’s always tell, and Alexa was an obscure name in 1945 but Alexis was fairly popular!If we could get it to call me when he says, “Alexis, call Tommy” or even, “Alexis, tell your buddy to call Tommy” that would be great.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M.Martin', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect for my granddaughter', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Flip phone is safer for young teens and the price was much cheaper on Amazon; the company actually told me this.

So can\'t rate the hi tech features. Phone is mostly for occasional or emergency use, and don\'t much care about camera capabilities. My last phone was a budget phone, so this was a quantum leap upgrade. This one seems to first and foremost to have MUCH better reach to the tower, granted the 5G capability likely has something to do with that. First cell phone ever which works at my house, and I\'m using the cheapest service provider there is here in the States, which I can\'t name here. Battery charges up fast, standby time is a lot better than my old phone ever was when new.Touch screen when scrolling and virtual keyboard and reorientation is snappy. Really like the adaptive brightness. Know most all phones now have wi-fi enabled calling, even my old phone once did but when changed service providers they no longer supported on the antiquated handset. Wi-fi enabled calling works GREAT on this phone. When my antiquated DSL isp was down recently, I actually used the 5G Samsung A54 as a hotspot for my computer.Like the size, personally find the glass back to be very slippery, I\'d been just as happy with a hi quality plastic back.One thing worth noting is Samsung promises upgrades for several years. This was a new phone model in March of 2023, AND Amazon offered a 90 day return policy. Very important as needed to make sure would work with my service provider. Thought was they might need to send a new SIM card, and by that time return window could close. Happily, no problems old SIM card plugged right in, and presto phone was working within minutes.Also for a great price, this is brand new handset, not one which was supposedly ""refurbished"", used, customer return whatever.  Has a recent Android version, so wasn\'t buying some phone already out of date when I got it, like my last one was. (Samsung Galaxy J3, was a good little phone for the money and served well).Note the charger brick is not included, although the type C charging cable is. Most people probably have a spare charger or two laying around, but not in my case. Work around was: used the AC adapter for my MacBook Pro until got to the store and picked up a charger brick for the type C cable. Also got a legacy USB2 cable to Type C usb cable which allows the use of older AC charger bricks or older car cigarette lighter adapters.All in all two thumbs up, I mean what is not to like!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'S.

The fingerprint sensor, and modem were supposed to be improved over my old Pixel 6, but sadly, I didn't see it. That is when I decided to try this A54. While it may not be quite as fast as the Pixel, and it doesn't have voice type, or phone monitoring, it is an extremely well-balanced phone. It feels premium, and the software has a very smooth fluid feel to it. Also, the fingerprint scan has never failed me, and the cell signal is about 10% better than both the Pixel 6, and 7a. The bonus is that I got it on Prime Day and saved about $130. Features are nice, but reliable unlocking, and great cell signal with a smooth OS are priceless.Update 8/26/23: I've had this phone for a tad over 5 weeks now, and it is getting to be my favorite phone I've had. It is very smooth, super reliable, and does everything I need. On paper, this phone is no powerhouse compared to flagships, but I don't miss the extra power one bit. I'm not a gamer but I play games and I'm not a photographer but I shoot very nice pictures. Not once have I missed the extra power. That said, my biggest complaint with Pixels was the biometric security. Fingerprint sensors, and face recognition for me was 85%. This A54 has never failed to open on the first try since I've had it.

I'm an unoppressed minority...  one of the few that try to get as much life as possible out of my mobile phones and I think I found a good option here.For a mid-range smart phone, the camera is very competitive.

I also like that the operating system does seem to be managing app behaviors to improve battery life, although this feature does cause a few minor problems now and then.This is not my first Samsung phone. I moved away from Samsung years ago, mainly because their better phones dropped support for memory cards and because of the preinstalled bloatware. Some of the Samsung apps are very useful, other's not at all. I would prefer that the customer was given the option to install the apps from the Samsung store, rather than bog down the device with apps that never get used. I'm disappointed there is no headphone jack. This would be easier to swallow if Samsung included a USB C headphone adaptor - unfortunately that was not the case. And speaking of things not included... no charger is included. The lack of a charger didn't bother me though, since I have a large assortment of USB chargers and the phone does seem to take advantage of industry standard fast charging on the chargers that support this. The price tag made some really wild swings during the time I purchased. Fortunately, I was able to purchase at a low spot.In summary - The camera, the memory card slot, OS/security update support, and the price tag (at times) make this phone a winner in my opinion.\nRead more""}]",11.1358574610245,B0BSLR2L5R,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0BSLR2L5R,5g

It would connect for a little bit, the won\'t receive signal. It will keep you connected to wifi, but will act as if you have no internet. I keep my wifi off for best data performance, which is great for me. For those looking to stay connected to wifi, this may be a deal breaker. I\'ve looked on Reddit and this seems to be an issue with the 8 series. Hopefully it gets patched, but considering it\'s been over 6 months, it\'s unlikely.I left Android for iPhone about 5 years ago, and I always missed the freedom Android gave me. The ""major"" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that\'s a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (""chugged"" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).I won\'t explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won\'t let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn\'t notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to ""pass the aux cord"" XD.The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it\'s primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can\'t compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you\'ll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you\'ll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn\'t matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn\'t use it, anyway.Tl;dr:If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'GBustin', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything about it is amazing.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024', 'Review Body': '2nd UPDATE on 8/7/2024:Somebody asked if the Redmagic 9S Pro was compatible for Bend Oregon? To begin with, I have a 8S pro, the model before. I have not heard of ANY incompatibility issues. I have T-mobile and it works perfectly. It has a double sim tray and I could have 2 phone numbers on it if I wanted. I still don\'t game, but I use it extensively to watch videos and run my Powerpoint presentations (in Google Slides). Everything runs perfectly, and extremely fast, never a gliche. I know my phone is over-powered for what I do, but it\'s like owning a Lamborghini to run everyday errands. And the battery is the best thing. I still charge my phone every 3 days, and I use it a lot. I also use my standard 3.5mm phone jack a lot too and would have gotten it for that one thing. The antenna is great, never a gliche using google maps. It is just an awesome phone. I worried that it\'s 6.8"" size might be too big, but with a slim case, the thin phone fits easily in the front pockets of my jeans. I assume the 9S pro is the same or better.UPDATE ON 3/24/2024:This phone is amazing for what I need. Most amazing is the 6 amp hour battery that never seems to run out. I used to charge my old phone every day, sometimes twice a day. I charge the new redmagic phone every 3 days (still at 20%), and it only takes 18 minutes to fully charge! That one thing alone makes it worth the  money. It is extremely fast for video & powerpoint files, and the usb3.2 jack allows me to connect to my PC and easily and quickly move big files back and forth. You don\'t need to play games to make good use of an extremely powerful phone.INITIAL REVIEW:First I\'m not a gamer, but I need a powerful phone with big screen, USB3.0 or better data transfer and most of all, a 3.5mm headphone jack! This has it all. It has an awesome big screen with graphics subprocessor system that makes it extremely fast, which wasn\'t absolutely necessary, but it plays my powerpoint files breathtakingly fast. The USB 3.2 connector connects easily to my PC because it is important for me to transfer large data files to and from the phone. It works great. It has 12GB ram and 256GB rom, the minimum for this phone. That is more than I need but you can upgrade to much more memory and storage. I use the 3.5mm headphone jack nearly every day to play music and videos, and absolutely would not have a phone without one. The BATTERY is a monster. It has two 3,000 mah batters totaling 6,000 mah. What that means is the way I use it, I only have to charge it every 3 days! And after I run it down below 20%, it recharges all the way to full in about 15 minutes. Amazing. I had heard that the camera wasn\'t the best, but it is plenty good for me. It has Sony lenses and takes great photos and videos, in high resolution if you want, and even has a pro mode for mini picture adjustments that I will never do. And it costs literally half what a flagship samsung or iphone cost, half. I cannot comment on games which this phone was designed for, because I don\'t play games. The simple cheap case I bought for it looks sleek and great. The only possible negative is that it\'s heavy, because of the huge battery that lasts forever. SUMMARIZING: this is one awesome phone that any older non-gamer will be thrilled to own. BTW, I am a simple consumer, I don\'t work in the tech field.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mcfire', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best upgrade', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Had the Red Magic 5G for 4 years, so I was due for an update.

I spent many hours trying to activate this phone.  I had the miniscule nano sim card that is required, and it is just that:  miniscule.  Make that VERY miniscule?  I must have dropped it 10 times.  The instructions say to ""insert it"" and show a diagram of WHERE, but they don\'t say HOW.  To anyone who is as ignorant as I am about such things, please stick something sharp and thin down in that metal ""pocket"" where the nano card goes, and lift it slightly, or like me, you\'ll struggle getting it inserted!  I kept just laying it on top of that pocket, because it looked like that was where it went in the diagram.  I\'d put the back on and then discover that was WRONG.  I defy you to remove that back 5 or 6 times like I had to, and have any thumbnails left.  I finally wised up (?) and used a dull knife to slide in between the front and back to open it, and there were little pieces of the plastic all over the counter from cutting pieces when trying to prize it loose all those times.The phone is NOT easy to use, once you get it activated, (activating it is another whole ballgame, btw.  That was fun... NOT!)  I\'ve spent hours trying to discover just how to make a call and type a text on the thing.  Still not sure how either of those is done.  I will say, the sound seems to be good and even with my hearing aids, easily heard.I use a p.c. and an iPad for hours every day, and have no problems with either.  This phone is a very confusing, strange piece of technology, but I had to have it for certain tasks after my old cellphone became obsolete.  It did everything, and never a problem till I couldn\'t use it anymore.Edit:  I\'m finally fed up with this NOT Easyfone, and am returning it.  It wouldn\'t make even a simple call without problems--like letting Walmart know I was there to pick up my grocery order.  Simply refused. Final straw was when I placed a call to a friend, and she said I sounded like I was underwater--and so did SHE!  Then a few seconds later, the phone cut out completely and she had to call me back on my landline.  Maybe it was just this phone or perhaps me, but I can\'t recommend this Easyfone.

This feature phone has no internet capabilities which is one of the special securities. But it could still get minor hacks through the SS7 Protocol Phone System like screen hacks and a shutdown the phone hack will turn into either a shutdown the mic hack or shut down the speaker or disrupts the speaker but for smartphones it just  shut it down and the only way to override that is to get pair of wired earbuds with a mic to put it in the 3.5 mm jack. To help keep these minor hacks down you can when have too  shut it down immediately which also reduces the chance of an illegal program from getting a trace. A feature phone can be turned off with the SIM card in it versus the smartphone. Because the smartphone has to be shut down and the SIM card is be taken out because it\'s standby mode it\'s still actually gets power .Bluetooth does work on the this phone but if you turn it on it can compromise  the feature phone.  Granted it has different Operating System than IOS or Android. It\'s Operating System is called an Interface. The feature phone will work with different GSM cellular SIM cards. The catch is to prevent cellular phone account erasings by not accepting cellphone providers app because that puts your phone account online to be erased. Only certain cellphone providers like AT&T (GSM) have two authentication to keep this from happening. Verizon wireless has three authentications but they\'re CDMA  which won\'t work on this feature phone. The texting is still very old school , it\'s not like a smartphone. I wish I could find either a wireless keyboard or USB wired keyboard to override that to make it easier but I haven\'t been able find one yet that\'s compatible. It can send receive text including receiving picture text but it\'s very small you can only see it with a really times 10 powered magnifying glass or if you have a computer hook it up to a computer to go through its files. It does have a micro SD slot I haven\'t checked that one out. Also once in awhile they\'ll be a light clear screen saying it can\'t find files on the side of the screen All you have to do is pop one into the battery out and then put it back in and then it\'ll actually function again. That doesn\'t happen a lot. Yeah you can set up ring and vibrate but some of these phones once in a while it might be touchy and you\'ll be wondering why it won\'t ring you got to look for the icon if there\'s a speaker with a slash through it and then go in there and turn it back on with that occurs. It does have alarm clock alarm clock settings and they do work. It does have a phone book that you can put contacts into. You could read missed calls through the green phone icon. Certain types of metal siding buildings prevents you from making calls in, you have to go outside the building to get a signal. If you make a phone call and for some reason it says, ""You\'re unable to make calls to this phone number."" just hang up and just redial again and it\'ll just make the call so long it\'s not international. The FM radio does work. It just has to do a search and it just starts working or preset FM radio channels to be saved. There\'s an option to play in background and you can manually search channels also. It does have an SOS feature for elderly people. people. It has a future called human voice which reads out phone numbers to you. Now if you don\'t want that playing to so people here phone numbers make sure it\'s shut off. And settings you can always reset the date and time and settings, set language, set sound settings, display settings, call settings and it has a setting for network settings and security settings. Overall for for basic functionality it does work but it can protect you long enough till you can get portable internet and a portable internet phone number from Vonage if your smartphone you doesn\'t have Wi-Fi calling. Vonage does have a two authentication process to log in to its app to prevent account erasings. But but some smartphones have to wait for an update and who knows when the update will come. If you have Wi-Fi calling as a feature built into your smartphone phone then you can go to Ooma home Wi-Fi and get an app and have home Wi-Fi with with Wi-Fi calling. It\'s about abandoning the cellular providers SIM card because it has a lot of vulnerabilities and going to portable internet which you only have a data only SIM card which drops the the SS7 protocol system keeps the SS7 protocol attacks from happening.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent mobile phone for basic calling and senior use', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Easy setup, great features like speed dial, large keys, lightweight.

The case has small lips that protects the camera and screen when you lay the phone down.Camera:  Gobs of megapixels but whatever, the most important thing to me is that photos come out very well (to me, a casual user), from close-ups to low-light indoor shots to brightly-lit outdoor shots (sample photos attached).Performance:  With 8 GB of ram and a decent mid-range processor, I have not had any slowdowns, freezing, or stuttering as I play Royal Match and browse web pages.

As a family we used to use the Asus Zenfones up until around the 5 series and then we made the switch to Umidigi and have owned at least a dozen of their phones since that time.  With few exceptions, they produce bang for your buck winners.We ended up ordering this phone because my wife decided she wanted to prepay for a year of Visible service after her Mint Mobile contract was up.  Our older Umidigi devices that we\'ve tested have all worked fine on Visible (Verizon).  Unfortunately, her A15C had been working great on T-Mobile\'s network but would not work at all other than for data with Visible.  I got into the phone diagnostics screen and it showed that it was not provisioned on their network for VoLTE, which has been required for service on US carriers for around two years now, so we had to look for a different device.I saw that Umidigi had a new A15 variant out (this one) and it was based on a MediaTek chipset whereas the 15C was a Unisoc.  Our older phones that work with Verizon are MediaTek based, so I assumed that was the difference.  I also saw in early reviews that a lot of people were praising the camera, which is usually one of the weaker points of an Umidigi phone and has been my wife\'s only complaint over the years about them.  I was intrigued.You get a clear silicone cover, a power brick, and a charging cable in the package.  The Umidigi power bricks are high quality.  We use our older ones all over the house for a variety of devices and we\'ve never had trouble out of one.  You can charge from 0 to 100% in about two and a half hours, so it\'s fairly speedy.  It will also charge surprisingly well plugged into any 5V source.A usual strength of Umidigi devices since we\'ve been buying them (~5 years now) are really good batteries.  My Power 3 from 2019 is probably my favorite smart phone ever (the BB 8310 being the other contender).  When it was new it would go up to four days between charges and can still make it over two.  This has one of their usual 5000mAh paks (probably 5150? That\'s what\'s in most of their mid range lineup) and it doesn\'t disappoint.  It lasts my wife more than a full day per charge, and she has a bonkers amount of apps installed and running on her phone.  It would probably last me at least two days.The other strong point for them are their screens.  In my opinion Umidigi is best in class when it comes to their smart phone screens.  They are also crisp, clear and bright.  I have never had problems using one outside in full sunlight and they dim to a pleasant level when indoors.  I have had a life-long vision impairment so the clarity they offer is a big selling point for me.  This phone is no exception.  It\'s a big 6.7"" screen that\'s 720p which in my opinion is enough for a device this size and helps save some battery.My wife reports that the bluetooth radio in this phone is better than what it is in the 15C and she\'s not had any interruptions or dropouts leaving the phone sitting somewhere in the house and doing chores wearing her earbuds.  The phone does have NFC, but we have not tested it as of yet.One area where this phone struggles compared to our other devices is GPS antennae strength.  It can take a decent amount of time after turning on an app that requires GPS, such as Google Maps, before it gets a strong fix.  30+ seconds sometimes.  I\'ve been able to improve similar situations in the past using the re-calibration feature of the GPS Test app, but I haven\'t had time to test that with this one yet.  Also, it does not appear to have a compass built-in.One tiny side note is that it has an FM radio app that doesn\'t require anything to be plugged into the phone to work.  That is kind of cool.  You CAN still plug 3.5mm headphones into this phone (as with I\'m pretty sure all Umidigi phones).  The external speaker is adequate.  It\'s nothing special but it\'s not horrible, either.The other caveat for this phone, though I\'ve come to the conclusion that it has nothing to do with the phone itself, is that it\'s unreliable for Verizon service due to their \'white list\' (more like blacklist).  As mentioned at the start, my wife is currently using this with Visible\'s service.  It does work, and it should work since it has all of the required hardware, but I\'ve learned that Verizon is now implementing a \'white list\' for their network that only allows phones they sell OR models from Samsung or Apple (and maybe a handful of other specific phones) on their networks.  So, you boot up the phone with a Verizon sim card and it will work just fine until Verizon does a network sweep, sees that the device doesn\'t have an approved IMEI, and sends a bullet to disable service.  You can then re-enable the service (usually by toggling airplane mode, sometimes by rebooting the phone) and the service works again for anywhere from a day to a few hours.  Pretty annoying.  I\'m fairly certain AT&T implements the same sort of system.  Therefore I can\'t recommend this phone for anyone using a service other than one that\'s based off of T-Mobile\'s network.  Or maybe I should amend that to say that I can\'t recommend any US service other than one that\'s based off of T-Mobile\'s network.  They are happy to let you use unlocked phones so long as the hardware supports what it needs to, as it should be.  I\'d like to see Umidigi make an effort to get their phones whitelisted, but I\'m guessing it involves the equivalent of bribery to do so, which is unfortunate.If you find yourself in this situation one thing you\'ll need to do is enter the phone\'s diagnostics menu (from the dialer call *#*#4636#*#* or download the ForceLTE app from the Play Store) and under \'Set Preferred Network Type:\' select \'LTE only\'.  Reboot the phone and go back into this screen to make sure the setting stuck.  You may have to change this again after a Verizon bullet.My wife reports that call quality is good, including when using speakerphone.  She has not experienced the above network dropout when on a call, thankfully, since she uses the phone a lot on her work from home days.The MediaTek G95 octa-core processor and 8GB of RAM is pretty good for a mid budget device in this range.  As I noted earlier, my wife loads her phone up with an unbelievable amount of detritus, and it runs snappily right along despite this.  The phone also has the linux (underlying kernel for Android) ZRAM option \'Memory Expansion\' which will compress/decompress data going into a specified amount/region of your memory to let you trade additional memory that is way faster than anything outside of RAM itself for some of your CPU cycles.  It\'s behind all this (4+4) (8+8) nonsense you see in the advertising recently.  It does work well but these companies should be careful how they\'re presenting it.  It also comes pre-loaded with Duraspeed, which will nanny your apps and keep them from hogging system resources in the background.  It is configurable on a per-app basis, and is another pretty handy addition.This is the first Umidigi device I\'ve seen come with something other than a basically stock Android install outside of the two features mentioned above.  This one has a custom launcher app, \'DDU Launcher\'.  It looks like it\'s actually available on the Play Store for other devices.  My wife hasn\'t had any problem adjusting to it and likes the app auto categorization it offers on it\'s right-most pane.  It has been stable and doesn\'t seem to be resource heavy.So, the camera.  I had a pretty good idea of what I could expect with the rest of the phone, but I really wanted to see if improvements had been made in this area.  I would say yes, there have definitely been improvements compared to our other Umidigi phones.  I included a couple of random pics and a video.  Our older phones had \'ok\' cameras.  If you took pictures at the right distance and with the right lighting they would look pretty good.  I noticed with my new A13 Pro Max that they had made incredible strides with the low-light capability of the camera, and those improvements carried over to this model.  Unlike the A13 Pro Max, this model has also noticeable improvements in it\'s digital zoom quality and overall consistency.  This thing does not have a camera to rival a Samsung or Apple flagship, but I can honestly say it\'s now pretty good, probably really good compared to other models in this market segment.After a month of use my wife is really happy with the phone.  The Verizon whitelist is a thorn in our side that we\'re trying to figure out how to work around, but that\'s not the fault of this device.  Hopefully this trend reverses with AT&T and Verizon and doesn\'t infect T-Mobile.  People should be able to choose what device they want to use, not be artificially restricted in the name of corporate profit.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lee', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on July 17, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I recently got the UMIDIGI A15T, and I'm really happy with it. This phone offers a lot for its price.First off, the performance is solid. It runs on Android 13 and the MediaTek Helio G95, making it smooth and fast. Whether I'm switching between apps or playing games, it handles everything without slowing down. Plus, it's energy-efficient, so the battery lasts longer. The memory is impressive, too. With 8GB of RAM (expandable to 16GB) and 128GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and files. There's also an option to add up to 1TB via a TF card, which is more than I'll ever need.The camera is another standout feature. It has a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro, and a 16MP front camera. The photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light, which is great for someone who loves taking pictures. The 6.7-inch screen is big and bright, perfect for watching videos and browsing. The resolution is sharp, and the colors are vivid, making everything look great.Battery life is excellent. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day, and the 18W fast charging is a bonus. I never have to worry about running out of power. Extras like NFC, a side fingerprint sensor, and face unlock are nice touches that make the phone easy to use.Overall, the UMIDIGI A15T is a great mid-range phone with solid performance, a good camera, and long battery life. It’s a fantastic value for anyone looking for an affordable, capable smartphone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'VB', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This is. Budget phone that appears to punch well above what you would expect for it\'s price point. The 6.7"" screen is clear and bright although legibility is slightly difficult in direct sunlight, although not enough to be illegible due to the large screen.Included is a case, charger (not always a given these days), SIM removal tool and a USB C cable. The case is of good quality and should be more than up to protecting the phone from scratches and the odd drop.The design of the phone is understated, with minimal bezels on the front with a teardrop for the camera. The back reminds me of an iPhone for better or worse, with a triangular camera arrangement. Speaking of the cameras they are good for the price but understandably fall short of the flagships, the zoom was particularly impressive given the lack of telephoto although the macro camera was of middling quality.Charging isn\'t especially fast, but is standard on budget phones. The 5000mAh battery easily keeps the phone going for a day or two depending how heavily you use it and the phone always felt nippy enough, although I never tried any demanding games. The fingerprint sensor also works as expected and is quick to unlock the phone.Overall I\'ve come away very impressed with this budget phone, it has everything you need including a big screen, good battery life, NFC, and decent cameras. You can get improvements in the screen, charging speed and cameras with mid range or flagship options but those often cost at least 4x times the price of the A15T so this is a right bargain at £139.99  (at the time of review, a £14 voucher was also available making this am even bigger deal).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Roberto Matilla Augustinus', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on August 13, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es muy bonito, bien diseñado.

Using the Samung 4.0 battery saving feature I have the phone set at 85%  maximum chargeNote: I have the cable plugged into a UPS and not directly into the electrical outlet in the wall.  Charging might be faster if charging directly from an electrical outlet.3 Discharging - Maybe six or so hours of battery with continous video and audio streaming.  A full day\'s use of mixed use depending on how many hours you actually use apps on your phone.  Updating apps especially if you have a lot of them in addition to the Google and Samsung apps that come with the phone could use up to 5% of your battery charge during a single update session if you don\'t update daily.  Google app updates are big battery users.Overall the battery is okay.  Not great and not awful especially if you take the time to optimize your phone using Samsung\'s optimization features including Sleep and Deep Sleep.  I don\'t know how much the use of the phone app drains the phone as I am not a big phone talker so no point in checking.On a personal note.  I am not a big talker nor do I stream video or audio from my phone though I keep the phone on 24/7.  I am getting several days of use from a single charge to 85%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I received the phone on Saturday three days ahead of schedule.  Also received the case on Saturday, one day ahead of schdule.It was clear from the box the A52 5G came in that it was a renewed phone.  I didn\'t see any scratches on the display.  Since I keep the phone is a case like I have all my phones I didn\'t bother looking for scratches or marks on the back,  The seller has a 98% rating on AmazonAnyway.  I used Samsung\'s switch app to move all my stuff from my Tab A7 to the  A52 5G.  It took a while, a little over an hour.  Not all the apps moved over so I manually added the few that didn\'tThis morning the phone received Android 12 along with Samsung UI 4.0.  A definite improvement over Android 11 and UI 3.1.  One of the new features of UI 4.0 under Settings is a hardware test app.  Since the phione is renewed I was glad to see that.  I used it to check out all the hardware componentsm except facial recognition, which I am not using at the moment and they all checked out fine.Interesting, that all the Samsung apps on the phone udated from the Galaxy Store after 12.0 x 4.0 were completely installed.Now for a few comments about the A52 5GSo far no problem with my ISP accepting the phone.  Just switched the sim card and also the SSD card from my A12.  Both the phone and the card worked fine right after intalling them in the A52 5G.Not overwhelmingly fast or slow.  A nice speed for what I use a phone for.  I am not a gamer so I can\'t comment on that.The display while not great in the bright sun is more than readable outdoors in the bight sun.  The adaptive display feature works fine and doesn\'t dim the display too much in the dark.The audio without headphones or a bluetooth speaker while not the quality you get with those is loud enough without themI can\'t comment on the battery life at this time since I just got the phone along with an included fast charger brick and cable.  Charged it when I got it and again during the update to 12.0 x 4.0,  So in the less than three days that I have had the phone it has done heavy work on two of those days which obviously affects the battery drainage.As far as the  in display fingerprint scanner goes.  I knew before hand that it has gotten a lot of unfavorable reviews.  I am using it regulary even to open apps.  To wake the phone tap once to bring up the location of the scanner, then place your finger on that spot.  It works fine though it is a bitt slow.  You have to hold your finger on the scanner for a couple of seconds before it opens up whatever.I expect the battery will be fine since the phone is less than a year old and how many charges can one do in less than a year?  As the phones sytems softwarew learns and tunes itself and with some tweaks I imagine the battery life will be more than good enough.One last thing.  The A52 5G though it has the same display size 6.5"" as the A12 is lighter and narrower than the A12.  I have small hands and it is a comfortable fit.  I can\'t speak about one haned use since I have never used only one hand on any of my phones.  Hold the phone tight and secure from dropping it with my left and and operate it with my right hand.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lisa Reineke Tsolis', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone- no surprise!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I always had a Samsung phone that I would buy at the Metro PCS store.

You have to activate it with Lively, it cannot be used on any other service.It is large enough for most people to see the screen well.  It has a clear and simple menu, which can be adjusted as needed in the options. For a Senior who can learn, it will not take much effort to master the phone. Since it is an android, some features from google are available. An account from google will help transfer contacts to the phone. It is able to share location with other users of Google Maps without purchasing the Lively upgrade to track the phone location in a separate app. We are not using the advanced emergency response services from Lively yet but expect to in the future.For Seniors who cannot learn there are a couple of issues. It does not have a lift to wake feature, requiring the push button on the side to be pressed. This can be confusing for a person with some dementia to learn if they are transitioning from an Iphone to this phone.  Another issue is the contact list provided through Google contacts permits favorites which are displayed on the top of the list if you open contacts, or if you open the phone app, but not if you open texts. These minor differences may be hard to learn for someone without a memory. The solution is probably to delete all of the contacts except a few critical ones, and eliminate the favorites.  It is also possible to turn off the lock screen to make access simpler, but it will have no security at that point.We will see how it works, and I may update this review. At this point it appears to be the best option for a simple phone with actual features.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dean C.', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': '100% Scam', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this phone (& I use that term lightly) for my elderly Mother with cognitive issues due to MS.

Quick button presses should not be causing multiple reboots.Then we have the speaker and microphone. The sound coming out of this phone is like an AM radio from 1970. The microphone is just as bad. I used to be able to drive hands free but now I can\'t because anyone I try to talk to tells me they can barely hear me. It doesn\'t matter how close I get to the microphone or how quiet my surroundings are. They simply can\'t hear me.I also read someone else complaining about this phone and 5ghz Wifi. They are absolutely correct. When this phone was on the 5ghz frequency of my Wifi, it constantly dropped the signal. It would repeatedly flip back and forth between strong/weak signal, then drop it all together. Then reconnect and do the same thing over and over. The wireless access point was only a few feet away and not obstructed by anything.I\'m *very* disappointed in this phone. This thing is a nightmare. I do not recommend buying this phone at any price.2 month update:It\'s gotten worse. Now the WiFi randomly drops out on the 2.4ghz range. No warning. One minute it\'s connected, the next, I\'m on cellular. When I reconnect to my WiFi it displays ""!"" next to the WiFi status and has no Internet access. I have to restart my phone or it will stay like this no matter what I do.Speaking of restarting the phone, I still suffer from random reboots, and more recently, have noticed that it\'s been getting laggy. I don\'t install much on my phone. I don\'t game, and I don\'t use any resource intensive apps - so there\'s no reason for this phone to be getting laggy. None.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing. It is absolute garbage. Do NOT buy this phone.Final update:Had this phone a total of 5 months, 16 days and it\'s done. The WiFi on 5ghz or 2.4ghz is so bad, it\'s almost useless. I live in an area with very poor cell coverage so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. I just ordered a new phone today because I had no choice. It\'s money I really did not want to spend but, I need a phone that\'s capable of maintaining a solid WiFi connection. You can say it\'s a pretty safe bet that I won\'t be buying anything from Blu again.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'House', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone Great Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Wonderful phone I bought on sale at 40 on Amazon used “ clean no scratches “As soon 🔜 I installed the sim card and turn it on start working,But be prepared and patience because you will need to do at  leat 4 software upgrade until you reach Android 13What I like the most is that sim tray you can put 2 sim cards and the SD card at the same time, not like the other phones that offers you 2 sim but is a sim card and  SD card or 2 sim cardGreat I Like a lot and for that price is great\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'DARYL AKER', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Fast charging', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It's big, easy to use, lots of storage.

Bien entendu tout va dépendre de la façon d'utiliser le téléphone (appels, vidéos, internet,...) et de la fréquence, mais on peut compter en moyenne sur 2 à 3 jours d'autonomie.C'est énorme !◾ mémoire :on est sur du 8GB et sur du 256G en capacité de stockage. C'est fluide, rapide, l'ouverture et l'utilisation de plusieurs applications en même temps se fait bien entendu sans problème. Et on a un bel espace de stockage.◾ caméra : c'est du bon niveau aussi sur ce point. Accrochez-vous, puisqu'on est sur une triple caméra 48MP + 32MP. Et c'est appréciable d'avoir de la qualité sur photo avec un smartphone incassable.◾ robustesse : il résiste à une profondeur d'eau de 1,5 m pendant 30 minutes, il résiste aux chutes de 1,5 m et il résiste à la poussière. Les normes supportées sont les suivantes : IP68/IP69K/MIL-STD-810H.◾ autres points : en plus de tout ça, le téléphone a 2 emplacements de carte SIM, une caméra de vision nocturne et possède des haut-parleurs performants.📊 Mon verdict :⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Pour ce smartphone incassable, complet et avec des caractéristiques de très bon niveau.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M.G.B.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the Netherlands on February 23, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Video camera is NIET 4K.Ik heb Doogee gevraagd om duidelijkheid.Alleen De S96 Pro, V30 en Vmax hebben een 4K video resolutie.

Conocía la marca Doogee por ser una de las famosas en el sector, aunque un poco más caras que otras opciones rugerizadas. Sinceramente, tras morir mi último teléfono creo que el extra de dinero merece la pena. Estamos ante un móvil grande y pesado, pero que rebosa resistencia y batería por todos lados, la batería me ha llegado a durar 3 días, 2 días con un uso normal, aunque la velocidad de carga es normalita tirando a baja. En lo referente al apartado multimedia, destacaría sus altavoces, suenan muy muy fuertes, y su cobertura, que nunca me ha dado problemas por las rutas que tiro. Eso sí, la pantalla me parece regulera, tanto en tonos de colores como en resolución. El móvil viene con Android 12, una de las últimas versiones, y es bastante potente, he podido jugar a juegos como call of duy, slay the spire y genshin impact sin problemas. Se me ha caído un par de veces y sin rasgo alguno, además los puertos vienen protegidos por unas gomitas, que le da una protección extra frente al polvo y agua.En general, estoy muy satisfecho con la oferta de black friday que conseguí en Amazon.

They\'ll be excited to have a real Samsung Galaxy to show off to their friends, while not being able to download just about anything that their peers or an ad recommends.If the item description isn\'t clear enough, let me help: you absolutely CANNOT get away without activation on this phone. It is super-locked, both to the carrier and to Samsung\'s ""Gabb OS"" which provides a ton of safety features and parental controls that are above and beyond what you get with just the default Family Link app that\'s available on all Android devices.Technically at its heart this is a Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device with added Device Management controls that are very similar to a managed corporate-issued phone, except that the settings are geared toward child-safe restrictions and the ""Device Admin"" is Gabb itself. **There is no way to unlock/remove this.** Be sure that the Gabb network, features, and rules are what is right for you and your child. If you aren\'t interested in the Gabb OS, a plain old unlocked Galaxy A15 has identical hardware and MSRP without the extra software guardrails.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Chris doddato', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Cost, Quality and peace of mind', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I saw the brand new Gabb Pro 4 listed on Amazon for only $49 when the Gabb site has it for $199.

Can\'t tell you how the phone will work yet, as there are absolutely no directions or paperwork included.  As for ""excellent"" condition, yeah, not so much.  I\'djudge it as fair to good condition.  There is a great deal of obvious pitting and scratching all around the edges, although not on the screen itself.  It is definitely visible from more than 12 inches away.  I\'ll be putting it in a case to protect it, so hopefully that won\'t matter if it\'s just cosmetic.  I just worry that this phone went through the wringer with it\'s previous owner. It definitely looks like it\'s been dropped a few times...I have to say, compared to my current phone, a Galaxy Note 9, also purchased as a refurb over 4 years ago, this one is a disappointment.  That one was pristine when I received it.  Still looks great due to it being in a case, but the battery is starting to go, doesn\'t hold a charge very long, and gets really hot, really fast.  Also the speaker is going and since I use it for work and do a lot on speakerphone, that\'s critical for me.I too chose this Galaxy Note 20 as it\'s the last in the line that has the SD slot.Now I just have to go searching for a user manual online so I can figure out how to transfer all my data and memory/sim/etc.  Once I actually, hopefully, get to use it, I\'ll come back and update my review.Update: I\'ve had this phone for a couple of months now, and to say I\'m underwhelmed is putting it mildly.  Cosmetically, it definitely was NOT in perfect condition.  Very obviously used hard by previous owner.  But I can deal with that.  What I can\'t deal with is the poor volume control, the fact that it cuts in and out, and locks up.  I find I have to restart it far to often to get it to work.  Not what you want in a phone. I use my phone a lot for work and not being able to rely on clear sound is a deal breaker.  And it\'s not like I\'m walking around and the signal is fading in and out.  I live in an urban area, and talk to others in same area, and half the time I can\'t hear them or they can\'t hear me, or the sound cuts in an out.  So very annoying.  It\'s going back.  I\'d better get a full refund or I\'m going to be even more ticked.  This one was a rip-off in my opinion.  Completely opposite experience from my first refurb phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ragnorok', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The last Note with an SD card slot...', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I don\'t use face recognition so I can\'t say how well it works, but for the first week at any rate, the on-screen fingerprint reader has been amazingly easy to use.  I don\'t use my phone super heavy and it\'s not uncommon to have 70% or more battery when I put it on the wireless charger at night, and it\'s *significantly* less picky about placement on the wireless charger than the old phone (note 8).  The car has wireless charging and it\'s also much better charging there; the old one would often not be in the right place and not get any electrons, where this never fails to juice up.I got the Note 20 because it\'s the last Note (currently) that has an SD card slot; I\'m absolutely against some company gouging me hundreds of dollars extra for a 256GB phone when a 512GB SD card is under 50 bucks.  The drawback to that is this phone came with pretty much nothing at all but a charging cable, which isn\'t really adding any value.  It took me some time to find a way to get the SD card slot open, without their custom tool, because on this phone at least the hole is waaayyyy too small for a paper clip.  I finally unwound the spring from an ink pen, which was small enough and stiff enough to release it.  Seriously leave out the cable that probably everyone in the world has by now and put that tool in!  It\'s needed for the SIM even without an SD card.Speaking of SIM, moving my line to this phone was trivially simple.  The phone was apparently on T-Mobile previouisly and I\'m on Verizon, and everything worked flawlessly right from the phone.  Put the SIM in, turned it on, and followed the instructions.  Done.I got a Note because, well, I\'ve been a Note fanboy since the 4, when my old Droid with the hardware keyboard gave up the ghost, because of the S-Pen.  It\'s not something I use every day, but when I do use it, there is literally no alternative that works like the S-Pen.  If Samsung ever stops putting that on their phone I\'ll probably move on to something more affordable.This is my first ever refurb, and this one at least is exactly what one would hope; it physically indistinguishable from a brand new phone.  Even close observation in the light reveals no scratches or blemishes, it hasn\'t crashed or exhibited any wonky behaviour (knocks on head), and it\'s significantly snappier than the old one.  That\'s not just because it has more resources, I think it\'s because the UI has been tweaked.  For example when scrolling a long list this phone\'s ""inertia"", how long it scrolls untouched after a flick up or down, is much higher than the old phone, so it\'s considerably faster to browse by scrolling.  I\'m sure other improvements have been made as well, and together they translate into a much more responsive feel.The OS itself is similar to the Note 8, really, but it has even more bloat and unremovable cruft in it.  For exampe there\'s ""AR"" functionality now, but even though I have nothing AR, and if I do it\'s highly unlikely I\'ll use this phone in conjunction with it.  There\'s an ""AR Zone"" that can\'t be disabled, can\'t be removed, can\'t be told not to nag me with notifications, can\'t be managed in the slightest.  Seriously Samsung, get off your high horse.  You don\'t know what I want my phone to do; fine if you want to have that enabled by default, why do I care?  But can\'t disable it or remove all the massively huge list of permissions?  Want to rub some salt in there for me?  It\'s also considerably more in-your-face nagging about things; like I haven\'t figured out how to get it to stop nagging me to save passwords for web sites, as if the last fifteen times I\'d change my mind.  Stuff like that isn\'t helpful, it\'s obtuse and rude.Migration was a PitA, but that\'s normal, so I mention it anecdotally.  Samsung\'s ""Smart Switch"" does make it less than heinously atrocious, but ""Everything"" isn\'t (everything), and it still took me days to get all my appointments and other things loaded in.  Once I find my browser bookmarks and get them in I\'ll finally be done.  Least favorite part of getting a new phone is setting the @*% up.  I can back up and restore a computer with trivial ease but no phone maker yet is smart enough to do that with a phone.  Pathetic.I considered only four stars because of the missing SD card tool.  Not sure how many folks would be able to figure out how to open it with the hole being about 2/3 the diameter of a paper clip, which is by the way what Verizon recommends using if one can\'t find the tool.  I have no straight pins so I don\'t know if they work, but if I did I\'d still want to file the point off to be sure I didn\'t damage anything.But overall a VERY happy camper.  If you like Android it\'s likely you\'ll be satisfied with this phone, and if you\'ve never had an S-pen you\'ll probably be hooked.  lol\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ANGEL FLORES', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Me encanto el Cel, en muy excelentes condiciones en general, como dicen por ahi ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡Ni el patinado de una mosca!!!!!!Valio la pena la espera despues de haber tenido muchas complicaciones para obtenerlo en mis manossaludotes\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Emil', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 26, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I'm very happy with my Samsung note 20 ultra works perfect just the battery is draining a little bit to fast.

It came new in box with Android 13 on it. Was a bit leery because of bad reviews concerning the fingerprint reader and issues concerning the  battery getting very warm, but for every bad review there was a good review so I decided to give it a try.  At first I thought the fingerprint reader was a bit wonky but I re-registered my print and as some others suggested I added a second set of prints from the same finger and now have very little problem with the finger print reader and am happy with it.Another concern I had the first week of ownership was battery life. It seemed to go down pretty fast  and by the end of the day it was down to about 15%. The battery did get warm a couple times but by no means did it get hot. By the end of the second week I noticed battery life was still around 50% at the end of the day. The adaptive battery function seems to take several days to work. I'm not a gamer and am just using the phone for calls, texts, reading news, web browsing, taking photos and maybe a couple of short videos.  I use Android Auto in  my car and this phone works terrific with it. Much better than the Moto did.  I'm just using a regular USB C cord to charge it up.  Most the time I charge it overnight when it automatically does a slow charge and a message on the screen says it will be fully charged by 6am.  I have charged it up during the day using a wall wart from my old moto phone and it takes about 2-3 hours to charge.  As others have mentioned there are a few Google things to deal with like the  search bar that cant be removed from home screen.  The display is nice and is pretty good when looking at it in the sun.  Adaptive brightness has been working good.  Android 13 runs fast and no problems there.  Using the same plan as when I had the Moto but signal strength is better with this 6a.

We live in a ""cell phone world"" and there are many choices out there and I wanted a phone that I would be happy with for some time to come.Fast camera, quality OLED screen, Gorilla glass, 5G, water resistance rating and a decent livable size.  Phones can be huge making it difficult to manage in your day to day. How and where do you put it? This size can be put in your pocket or be worn on the belt.More about the ""Always On"". I appreciate the fact that when the phone is beside me, I can glance at it without touching it and it gives me information; Day, Date, Time etc. Not all screens/phones can do this.It has only been a week and I am still getting used to (and surprised by) all the features. I can recommend this phone without hesitation.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Cliente Amazon', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on October 2, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Fácil de instalar\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Luca', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on September 8, 2023', 'Review Body': ""Sto ancora discutendo con google per il problema del riconoscimento delle impronte digitali, al momento le legge una volta su 10.

It is so important to have a way of communicating with mother\'s condition, I was not sure I could wait for the replacement phone delivery and what if I had a problem again.  I agreed with Amazon and confirmed I would send back the phone immediately and wait for new phone.  Amazon said to me that they would take 100% responsibility if the I had a problem with the phone.

I used it for a day or two and it seems based on my usage (internet browsing, checking messages, light use of Youtube, etc), the battery drains by 15% in a day and almost doesn\'t drain at all when I am not using it. I can go for a while without charging, which is what I want out of a smartphone.* Comes installed with Android 14. A lot of midrange phones tend to be one generation behind in OSes and not all of them get updates to the current OS, so i was pleasantly surprised to see this phone come with the latest Android OS. It still needed an update or two, but that was mostly for the latest security patches.* Decently sized and good build quality. It\'s a little bigger than the average smartphone, but it\'s thin enough to fit in my pockets and it\'s not too heavy. The larger screen size makes it easier to read things. The build of the phone itself does feel rugged as it claims to be. The back has a diamond pattern, making it easy to hold and won\'t retain smudgy fingerprints.* Camera is pretty good. I took a few pics and they\'re pretty decent for what the phone boasts. It also has a macro option for super up close photos and night vision mode to take pics at night. They\'re ok, but I don\'t really use them since I don\'t need them.THE BAD:* No headphone jack. While I am not personally bothered by it, I know a lot of people will swear by a headphone jack and this can be a dealbreaker. There are USB to headphone jack adapters out there at least.* No SD card slot. You\'re stuck with the phone\'s 256GB of internal storage. If you use a lot of apps, take lots of pics, or record lots of videos, you might want to find another phone that lets you expand your storage.* Screen near impossible to see under sunlight. If it\'s a bright sunny day outside, it\'s hard to see the screen even if it\'s set to max brightness.THE MEH:* Almost useless custom/smart key. The phone has a red button the left that the manual dubs as a ""smart key"". It\'s basically a custom button that you can assign any gesture or action towards, but by default, the OS doesn\'t have an option to let you customize it. There are apps out there that can let you assign a command or the like for the button.* Fixed grid size. By default, the grid size on the screen is 4x5 and it cannot be adjusted unless you use an app that lets you customize your home screen, such as Nova Launcher.* The default clock. It\'s set to a 24 hour format, but it can be changed to 12 hours. The date format it shows is DD/MM/YYYY and it can\'t be changed unless you want to use a different clock app.* Bleh speakers. They\'re at the bottom of the phone and they don\'t sound too impressive, almost tinny-like.* Fingerprint sensor is on the power button, making it a bit finicky to activate. Would have preferred to have it on the back of the phone instead.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alton Gurney', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Works with Metro by T-Mobile!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I ordered this and then I read on here thatsomebody said it doesn't work with Metro by T-Mobile well I couldn't cancel it so it came anyway and tried it and it worked perfectly this is a fast phone on the best plan with T-Mobile\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'KRB', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone for the money.  one is not compatible with T mobile upgraded Network', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I purchased another brand of phone because it had everything I wanted in a phone.

I used 3 days without connecting to the charger. It allows me to no longer worry about charging issues frequently. It can last long time after one single charge.However, even with all the advantages, first of all, due to a large capacity of the charger, the overall weight of the phone is relatively heavy, which makes it inconvenient to hold by one hand for a long time. I need to switch hand or hold by 2 hands after a while.Overall, I've had a great experience with the phone, and pros clearly outweigh the cons.

Unfortunately, I never bought a Pixel because Google chose, at first, to compete with the expensive flagship phones that cost $800 or more being put out by Apple and Samsung every year. That has since changed, and I\'m a welcome convert back to the Google fold.My last phone was a Moto Z Play, which I purchased for $400 about three and a half years ago. I loved the battery life, but the bluetooth died almost entirely when the phone was two years old, and the camera was never great. By the time I had had it for three years, I couldn\'t run more than two or three apps without experiencing issues with crashing. Likewise, if I opened more than 50 or so tabs in the web browser, it would typically crash. It\'s a relief to no longer have those issues.COST: I purchased this phone when it was $320, so I already saved $80 over my last phone purchase. This phone does everything you need and looks sharp. It doesn\'t have 5G, but the amount of features you get for less than $400 more than justifies the price.CAMERA: Google has really outdone itself with the Pixel 3a\'s. The camera is fantastic; I no longer need to bring a dedicated digital camera when I\'m traveling or attending major celebrations like graduations that need a good camera. It\'s performance in low-light conditions is fantastic and really something to write home about. Sure, my  brother\'s iPhone 11 Pro has a better camera, but he paid over $1000 for it, so that\'s not a fair comparison. I\'d say that the Pixel 3A\'s camera and camera software is every bit as good as my wife\'s Galaxy 10, if not better.BATTERY LIFE: A full charge doesn\'t last the 2-3 days that my old Moto Z Play did, but the rapid charging feature makes it not matter as much. In my daily commute of 20-30 minutes to work, I can add about 30-40% to my battery, which means I never have to worry about my phone going dead, even if I forget to charge it at night. A full charge tends to last a little over a day with heavy use. For the record, nearly every day I browse the internet for hours, play Sudoku, listen to Spotify, and post and browse on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.HARDWARE: It\'s not a flagship phone, so it\'s not going to hold up to intensive use. That said, nothing I\'ve thrown at it so far as crashed it. Like I said, I\'m a heavy phone user. I don\'t have to close my apps before switching to another one like I did with my last phone to avoid crashes. I also have experienced hangs like I did with my last phone either. This really does everything you need it to do. I don\'t think that a normal to heavy phone user needs much more power than this unless they\'re gaming or photo editing on their phone or something. The bluetooth works a lot better than my old phones did. I have an aging 2013 Prius that does not like to play nice with bluetooth in a lot of my devices. I get in the car, and the phone automatically hooks to the bluetooth and brings up my last Spotify podcast without me fussing with it past the initial setup. I forgot how nice it was when things just worked, you know?LOOK & FEEL: I really like that it\'s lighter than my last phone even though the screen and the screen\'s resolution is much larger. It doesn\'t  have a trendy notch, but I don\'t really care. The fingerprint is located in a nice place in the back that feels very intuitive. There is a feature that lets you squeeze the phone to bring up Google Assistant that I could see some people enjoying, but I never use it because my hands are too small to put enough pressure on the phone to bring it up. Some people may dock a point or two for this, if it\'s important to you. I don\'t because I can just shout ""hey google"" at the phone to the same effect, and perhaps the feature works fine if you don\'t have tiny baby hands like me and buy a phone that\'s over 6 inches. The phone itself is mostly metal and glass and doesn\'t feel cheap. I don\'t think it looks like you spent less than $400 on it at all. Most importantly, it still has an aux port. Not all of us want the hassle of charging and keeping track of bluetooth earbuds that can cost more than your phone and don\'t sound any better than a $10 wired headset you can get at the pharmacy. The screen is absolutely huge and the resolution makes everything tiny. I don\'t have bad eyes and I\'m not an old maid, but I had to set the text size to ""large"" otherwise every website looks like those old Myspace profiles people made back in 2002 with size-6 font. It\'s very comfortable to read on; I don\'t feel like someone would need a dedicated tablet with a phone with a screen this big.SOFTWARE & OS/UI: If you\'re getting an Android OS, you\'ve probably fine with the OS. That said, Google\'s UI is so much better than everyone else\'s (I\'ve used UIs by Asus, Samsung, and Motorola in other phones). The home screen is easier to customize, the app launcher makes sense, and the app switcher is intuitive and quick. Since it\'s Google, you\'ll have the newest Android OS\'s at launch and support for longer than other manufacturers. That was one thing I missed dearly about my old Nexus, and I\'m glad Google is finally back in the sub-$500 market again so I can take advantage of it. I think my favorite feature about the UI is that I can turn on ""dark mode"" 24/7 so that I never have white bars or menus anywhere, just nice black ones. It\'s really saved my eyes. I also like that the volume and brightness on the phone has a very wide range of levels, much moreso than any other phone I\'ve had before, which always had ""silent,"" ""soft-ish"" and ""extremely loud"" with little in between. I can turn down the volume to almost-silent and the brightness to actually quite dark without installing third party apps. Also, there\'s no bloatware on the phone when you purchase it. That\'s really nice.All in all, it\'s a very solid phone and I\'m honestly thrilled with how nice the screen and camera is at this price-point. Everything else I\'ve looked at with comparable specs and features is at least $100 more. I\'ve been using mine for the past couple of weeks, and every day I like it more. Full five stars from me.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'C. Okamuro', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'I have a full Pixel 3 XL for work, and was excited for the 3a XL hit the market.  Highly Recommended', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2019', 'Review Body': 'After several years of growing tired of my Samsung Galaxy work phones getting slower and more bloated with the Samsung UI, I was convinced by coworkers to go to a Pixel.  I got the Pixel 3 XL and instantly loved it.  Seconds, rather than minutes, to boot.  A fast UI experience.  Frequent and comprehensive OS updates that aren\'t lagging months behind the Android updates.  A fantastic camera.  What\'s not to love?Even though I refer to my Pixel 3 XL as my work phone, the truth is that I haven\'t had a personal phone in over a decade... who wants to carry two phones?  Then again, there is something to be said about having a healthy work/life balance.  With that in mind, I was curious when I heard about the 3a coming to the market... as much as I love the 3 XL, I can\'t say that I was super excited to spend $900 on a phone.  When the 3a XL dropped below $300 (after the deal that gave you a $100 GC), it seemed like a no brainer.As someone that has both a 3XL and a 3a XL, here\'s what I can tell you:SCREENUnlike the 3 XL, the 3a XL has no screen ""notch"".  Where there are some parts of the UI that take advantage of the notch, there are just as many applications that leave an annoying color (non-black) artifact in the notch area when watching landscape full-screen video - it\'s SUPER annoying.  The 3a XL\'s screen is slightly smaller than the 3 XL, and while it\'s also a little lower resolution, the density (as a result of the smaller diagonal measurement) doesn\'t drop that much.  In general usage I don\'t notice any difference.  The 3a\'s screen is OLED, but it appears to be a quality tier below the 3 XL\'s... you can see it if they are side-by-side, but you wouldn\'t notice it if you were going from memory.CAMERAPixel phones are renown for their camera performance.  While the raw specs tend to be behind other flagship phones\' optics and CCDs, the actual picture quality tends to be at or near the top of the heap.  The Pixel 3a XL is no different, as the rear camera is the same as the one on the 3 XL.  The front camera (which I really don\'t care as much about) goes with a single, rather than a dual, camera setup.  It\'s not the same as either front-facing camera on the Pixel 3 XL, but the software (which is largely responsible for the picture quality), is the same.  Both cameras appear to be excellent.FORM FACTORThe Pixel 3a XL is slightly larger than the Pixel 3 XL.  Some of it may be due to the notch-less screen causing the speaker and camera to be mounted above the screen.  Some may be due to the larger capacity battery.  Perhaps it\'s also influenced by the case material on the back being made of plastic, rather than glass.  Regardless, the phone is about 10% lighter, which is enough to be noticable.  An omission that I don\'t love is that the 3a XL does not support wireless chaging... it\'s not the end of the world, but it is missed.PERFORMANCEThe 3a XL does have a significantly slower CPU than the 3 XL.  The layout of both processors is to have 4 high speed cores, and 4 slower cores.  The general idea is that the system workloads can be managed by the OS\'es thread scheduler, and be placed on to the lowest power consuming core that is still adequate for the job.  Both phones are fine with multitasking.  I didn\'t actually notice any performance difference is the UI or in application speeds, but I also am not a mobile gamer... I would expect for the difference to be most obvious there (assuming there is one).  I was a little surprised when the 3 XL came out with 4GB of RAM (since I didn\'t know if that would be enough), but that worked out well.  The 3a XL has the same 4GB of RAM and therefore has similar performance.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES NOT ALEADY MENTIONEDOddly, the Pixel 3a XL has a headphone jack.  That\'s noteworthy because the 3 XL does NOT have a headphone jack.  I know there are some ""purists"" that are anti-bluetooth, but I\'d say that a phone is not an audiophile platform anyway.  Even if you have awesome $1500 headphones, I can still tell you that the DAC in your sub-170 gram phone is junk (comparatively).  One of the really nice features of the Pixel 3 XL is that it\'s waterproof... the 3a XL is not.  It\'s not a dealbreaker for me, but I can see where this would affect some peoples\' choices.In conclusion, I thought the deal I got on Amazon when I bought my 3a XL was so good that I bought the phone without even knowing if I\'d get a service plan for it.  Now that the 3a XL is at its ""normal"" price I still think it\'s an incredible deal, and I really question anyone who would buy a different phone at this device\'s price point.  Highly Recommended.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tracy Jones', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on July 18, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I switched from Samsung Galaxy to the Google Pixel because I wanted a better camera, and I definitely got better quality photos though it seems I don't have as many options for editing the photos on the Pixel, like adding stickers, etc. Reading the reviews, the notch was a big deal to some people but I don't notice it at all. I found it awkward to take screenshots - how do you hold the power and volume buttons at the same time when they're on the same side of the phone? On the Samsung they were on opposite sides so much easier. I accidentally discovered that I can just swipe up and get a screenshot button to press. I didn't find that tip in any of the help sites. Adding the emoji icon to the phone keyboard shortcuts was something else I figured out by accident. You'd think it would be there already. I like the call screening feature! It's easy and works great. I find the battery doesn't last as long as I would like, but I guess that's to be expected from a new Pixel 3 XL that I bought more than three years after it was released in 2018. It does charge very fast and it was super easy to transfer apps from my Samsung using the cord that came in the box.

Had been using a Galaxy S8+ the last few years and was looking for something new, with better battery life (I was usually get 12-14hrs on my S8). So far the 3a XL hasn't disappointed! Yesterday I went to bed with the phone at 37% battery after being unplugged for 17 hours and had over 5 hours of screen on time (still had another 8 hours in the tank according to the phone). My only complaint is with the Pixel launcher which forces you into having the Google search bar and what's happening widget in your homescreen all the time. Can't be removed.... Considering I was looking for the 'true' Android experience I was floored that they won't let you change that. Oh well, went to the Play store, grabbed Nova launcher and all is well!

No se dejen engañar por el hecho de que su competencia tiene 3, 4 o hasta 5 lentes para fotos, o que si tiene 64 megapixeles etc. Honestamente esos son trucos de mercadotecnia, y este Pixel 3a XL lo demuestra con un único sensor, pues toma fotos que incluso supera celulares que valen hasta el doble, se nota que Google optimizó muy bien el software de la cámara para que tome fotos a la altura del Pixel 3XL que es su hermano mayor a pesar de que este último cuesta hasta $150 dlls más. El único punto ""débil"" que le veo al celular es su diseño, que a muchos no les gusta porque en las tendencias actuales los celulares poseen pantalla completa, y los marcos superior e inferior son algo vistosos, pero al menos a mi parecer hace al celular más cómodo de usar ya que evitas tocar la pantalla accidentalmente mientras juegas o ves videos, pero eso es completamente personal. En cuanto a la pantalla, es de 6 pulgadas OLED y también es de muy buena calidad, (full hd+) para el precio, tiene sonido estéreo que se escucha fuerte, pero no recomiendo subir todo el volumen ya que se saturan las bocinas (aunque es normal, pasa incluso en celulares más caros) basta con bajarle 2 puntos al volumen e incluso así se escucha fuerte, cuenta con jack 3.5mm para audífonos, la carga rápida es de 18 W y entrada usb-c, posee lector de huellas digitales en la parte trasera. La batería dura bastante y les anexo mis estadísticas de uso para tengan una perspectiva de la duración (Mi record fue sacarle 7 horas de pantalla con brillo al 75%) y en el caso de Call Of Duty Mobile funciona con los gráficos en alto y nunca se me ha atorado o cerrado inesperadamente en el uso cotidiano, sólo una vez me pasó pero porque intencionalmente abrí como 20 aplicaciones y otros juegos porque estaba cambiando a cada rato entre los mismos para poner a prueba la potencia del celular. Un punto fuerte que para mi en lo personal es muy importante es que tienes 3 años de actualizaciones tanto del sistema operativo como en parches de seguridad, y como plus el celular cuenta con el chip titan de Google, el cual se encarga de integrar bien la seguridad del software y hardware. Por lo que en cuanto a sus datos personales pueden estar tranquilos. El sistema operativo está muy bien pulido y funciona muy bien, ya que Google tiene control total tanto del sistema operativo como del hardware, y el celular funciona bajo al idea de como Google visualiza que debería funcionar android en los dispositivos con este sistema operativo. Si algo es seguro es que no se van a equivocar si deciden comprar este smartphone, les hará sentirse satisfechos con su compra.\nRead more'}]",73.06889352818372,B07R5CJDD7,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07R5CJDD7,4g

It's designed for being outdoors and people that have jobs that are maybe more physically demanding, such as in building trade or similar.There are several great features here that you don't normally see under the $200 price range. This has a huge and I mean HUGE 10600mAh battery. That's around twice what you'd find on a modern regular phone. I find this carries me for two days easily with moderate to heavy usage. It's super speedy and I haven't encountered any lag or slowdown and that's likely down to it having 16gb ram. This phone is also loud, not that loud that it will replace your bluetooth speaker but I will happily play Spotify on this and use it while I work. You need to keep the speaker on the back facing upwards.There are other good features here too such as it running on Android 13 and it's also a dual sim phone, so you can use it for business and personal.On the negative, this is only compatible on the T-Mobile network in the USA. I tried my AT&T sim and it didn't work. My work sim is T-Mobile and that worked without issues. Having no support for AT&T and also Verizon could be a dealbreaker for a lot of people. The 6.57 inch screen is also only HD+ which means a subpar 720p. That's not terrible on a screen this size but it's a far cry from the majority of phones out there today.

However, I've encountered a significant issue with the speaker functionality that's impacting my experience.About 7-10 minutes into using the speakerphone, the sound abruptly cuts off. I can't hear anything through the speaker until I manually toggle the speaker button off and on again on the screen. Fortunately, the other person on the call can still hear me during these episodes, and once reset, the speaker works fine again for another short interval.This recurring issue is a dealbreaker for me. A reliable speakerphone is essential for my needs, and having to constantly monitor and adjust the speaker during calls is not acceptable.

I would not use this as a personal phone that I carry with me, it is no better than my iPhone SE 2 from several years ago.The worst aspect of the phone is the camera. I don\'t know enough about cameras and smartphone cameras to make an informed assessment of why it\'s bad based on technical specifications, but it is simply a poor camera. The photos are nowhere near as good as what I would get on my main phone or, as another example, the Pixel 6! They look flat and like they have poor lighting, regardless of how you take the photo. It just generally produces poor output.Second, for the price, this is definitely a GOOD phone. This is about as good as it gets for a smartphone at this price, and honestly I am surprised they\'re capable of making phones like these. Support for 2TB of a ""TF"" card (I believe this just means MicroSD) alone is a GREAT feature you\'re not going to find on a lot of other phones out there. The battery life is good as well.So, overall, I think this is not a bad smartphone for its market. Clearly this is aimed at customers who are not willing to spend $350+ on a phone.

I still recommend getting a screen protector and case, because not everything is full proof. Kids can still do the impossible. So bare that in mind.It's a shame that the main company Bullitt Group went out of business and is no longer supporting this device which means the proprietary apps provided won't work. However, the proprietary apps were redundant anyway. You can get the same features just by downloading apps from the Google Play Store.Please note that this device runs on Android 11 OS which is no longer being supported by Android as of Feb 2024 which means you'll won't be getting future security updates anytime soon. However many apps will still run from the Google Store which I have trial and tested. Therefore, you'll have many years of good usage. In addition, I will state that we were able to get the last updates of Android 11 and related security features.I do love the fact that this device has a reprogrammable button where you can set it to open or use any feature. The camera is a bit slow to focus, but takes good quality pictures. The sound quality is good, but not very loud in a noise environment when listening to apps. Speaker phone however is perfect. It has good reception, wifi and bluetooth connections.The price is affordable with plenty of additional storage options. I am able to use a 256gb Micro SD.

It’s actually made of metal to help with the ruggedness/durability.  The camera lenses are also recessed slightly from the body by 0.6mm to provide added protection if you lay your phone down flat either face up or face down.There are 2 contact points on the back cover.  I believe these are charging contacts when placed into a dock or some sort.The sides/edges are all aluminum.  It provides a very premium look/feel to the phone.  Unfortunately, the aluminum feels smooth/slick in the hands and therefore not very secure when held, but the rounded edges does make it comfortable to hold.The back cover is made of plastic with a knurled patch on the lower half to provide added grip.  I do wish the same material wrapped around the sides so the phone would feel more secure in my hands.The phone weighs approx. 258g, which is actually not that bad as my Samsung S23FE with case is actually 259g, so it’s not as heavy as expected.The buttons all feel like metal, which adds to the phone's premium feel.  They have knurling on the power and feature button to provide a different feel vs the smooth volume buttons.  It may provide extra grip when pressing, but I think it’s more to differentiate between the buttons.The position of the volume/power buttons seem to be reversed vs other mobile phones I’ve used/seen.  The power button is on top while the volume is on bottom.  This is definitely a bit confusing and something I will need to get used to.All the buttons are very tactile and provides a slight click when pressed so you know when you pressed a button.The bottom of the phone contains the USB-C charging port as well as the single down firing speaker.The left of the device houses the cover for the SIM & MicroSD tray and an orange feature button.  When I took the phone out of the box, I noticed that the SIM tray cover was open.  I just thought it wasn’t closed when shipped but found out quickly that it automatically reopens on its own after 20-30mins.  Seems there’s a slight defect with the product as this will affect the water resistance of the phone.  The feature button can be setup for different functions depending on how it’s pressed.  It can be setup to open specific apps and the system provides a list of options.Comes with a USB-C wall charger, which is rare to see these days.Boot-up/Setup:On first power on, you see a T-Mobile logo.  Setup is similar to any other Android phone.  Once setup is complete, reboots/power on only takes approx. 30secs to get into the OS, which is significantly faster than current flagship phones.The screen is clear but does seem a bit dimmer than other rugged phones I have tested even with the brightness at 100%.The phone came with Android 10, but it did detect and installed Android 11 without issue.When checking the settings, it indicated that the phone was locked to T-Mobile.  When I selected the option to permanently unlock, it unfortunately produces a “Server Error: Error Code 255”.  I inserted my active SIM card and still shows as locked.  I read some other product reviews, and someone indicated that the phone showed locked but was still able to make calls and access cellular data.  I didn’t even try to test, but with the SIM installed, it actually worked properly.  I was able to make calls and surf the internet without issues, so it does look like the phone is unlocked even though the phone reports it as locked to T-Mobile.It was able to achieve an LTE+ connection and running a speed test was able to hit over 30mbps download speeds.I’m not a fan of the stock Android OS interface as it feels clumsy (to me) vs the custom interface provided by Samsung, including the applications.  Customization is a bit limited in some areas (e.g. changing the lock screen wallpaper & home screen wallpaper to match).Fingerprint Reader:The fingerprint reader on the back detects my fingerprint very quickly and approx. 98% of the time.  There were a few times it did not detect, some because I didn’t contact the full sensor while others just didn’t read it.  Overall, detection is good and the screen unlocks quickly.I find the actual fingerprint sensors better than the on-screen sensors.  This is a defined location that is fairly hard to miss while you may miss the on-screen sensor depending on how you hold the phone.  They’re also affected by screen protectors.  I would probably prefer if the sensor was on the power button as that doesn’t require the phone to be picked up in order to unlock like the sensor on the back of the phone.Speaker:The single down firing speaker at the bottom of the phone is surprisingly powerful.  It doesn’t contain a lot of bass, but depending on how the phone is positioned, you can get some very loud audio.  Holding the phone in portrait (upright) the speaker will blast the audio towards you.  Placing the phone flat on the table in portrait or landscape (upright/sideways) will cause the audio to reflect off the table and back up at you making the audio louder.  But, if you hold the phone in landscape (sideways) with your hand (not on the speaker side), it won’t reflect the audio back at you and you lose a good 25% of the volume level.  And, if you accidently cover the speaker with your finger, you lose a good 75% or more, so be careful not to cover the speaker grille.Cameras:The rear of the device shows 2 camera lenses, but the system only reports as 1 camera mode, so I’m not sure what the 2nd lens is for.  I went through all the modes and found that only the bottom lens is real & functional.  Another bad item is that the lenses are made of plastic.  It’s more shatter resistant in a fall, but prone to scratches.The product specs indicate the main camera is 48MP, but the actual camera’s settings indicate it’s actually 12MP using quad pixel technology.  Basically, it uses 4 adjacent pixels to make 1 image pixel called pixel binning, so the image quality is supposed to look better using a lower megapixel camera sensor.  The front camera is correctly labelled as 8MP.Taking pictures with the main camera and I found that it doesn’t handle exposure correctly.  When focusing the camera on a brighter light source, the entire image will dim and depending on how bright it is, will dim down to the point the surrounding image is so dark you can only see the bright source.  I found later that this is when in room light situations.  When outside on a sunny day, it does a better job.Pictures are surprisingly decent.  I compared images with my Samsung S23FE and took a photo of a seat cushion, I found this phone capture clearer/sharper images of the surface of the cushion while the Samsung blurred the surface via its software processing to give it a softer/blurrier look.Videos on the main camera are not the best only recording at only 1080p @ 2MP.  As mentioned above the auto exposure is not great and darkens videos when you don’t want them darkened.  You can see a lot of shimmering/noise around surface edges (trees, buildings, cars & people) and pretty much anything that moves.The front camera is spec’d at 8MP.  Selfies are ok but contains a lot of noise throughout the image.  It looks to be over sharpened to try to increase the detail levels.  Something in a pinch and it’s fine, but I wouldn’t use this for my main camera while on vacation as permanent memories is where you want as much quality and detail as you can get, and this front camera will not provide that level of detail.  Again, this mainly depends on how much light there is, the brighter it is the sharper the image.I did notice that for some reason when recoding videos with the front camera in Portrait orientation, my head/face is squished down so my face is wider than it should be.  Details around me seem OK, but there’s no real comparative vs a face.  I placed just my hand and the same issue.  I tested in Landscape orientation and found everything looked correct, so there’s definitely something wrong with the camera or software that just doesn’t like portrait mode in the front selfie camera.  That’s a disappointment as this is probably the orientation most will use when taking a selfie as it’s the easiest position to hold the phone.Main Camera Photo Details:- Dimensions: 3000 x 4000- Mega Pixels: 12MP (Quad Pixel)- Resolution: 72dpi- Bit Depth: 24- File Size: 4.42MB- File Extension: JPGSelfie Camera Photo Details:- Dimensions: 2448 x 3264- Mega Pixels: 8MP- Resolution: 96dpi- Bit Depth: 24- File Size: 2.36MB- File Extension: JPGMain Camera Video Details:- Dimensions: 1920 x 1080 (or 1080 x 1920 in Portrait Orientation)- Mega Pixels: 2.1MP- Video Bit Rate: 9671kbps (may go up/down depending on environment lighting conditions)- Frame Rate: 30fps- Audio Bit Rate: 101kbps- Channels: 2 (Stereo)- Audio Sample Rate: 48kHz- File Size: 8.54MB for 7secs of video- File Type: MP4Front Selfie Camera Video Details:- Dimensions: 1920 x 1080 (or 1080 x 1920 in Portrait Orientation)- Mega Pixels: 2.1MP- Video Bit Rate: 8962kbps (may go up/down depending on environment lighting conditions)- Frame Rate: 30fps- Audio Bit Rate: 94kbps- Channels: 2 (Stereo)- Audio Sample Rate: 48kHz- File Size: 15.5MB for 13secs of video- File Type: MP4Performance:I ran a few benchmark tests to see how it stacked up.  I was surprised to see it didn’t perform that well vs other older model phones.- 3DMark Sling Shot Test: 1863 (a Samsung Galaxy S7 from 2016 had a rating of 2908)- AnTuTu 3DBench Lite v10.2.1:  o Marooned – OpenGL ES 3.0 (Onscreen=9.54fps, Offscreen=8.81fps)  o Coastline – OpenGL ES 3.0 (Onscreen=9.89fps, Offscreen=8.71fps)- GeekBench6: CPU-Single Core=318, Multi Core=1239 / GPU=252- PCMark: Work 3.0 Performance=6178 (Samsung S7 from 2016 had a rating of 5021)The performance numbers weren’t great as it has trouble outperforming a phone released 2016.  Yes, it was a flagship phone at its release, but I would have hoped something released in 2021 would beat something that came out 7 years earlier.Based on the gaming numbers, the phone is not meant for gaming.  Very basic stuff will work, but not more graphics intensive games as it was only able to get just below 10fps.Using it to view videos on YouTube and surf the internet is perfectly fine.  There is some lag when loading additional videos/graphics but is still ok.Moving around in the phone, swiping screen, taking photos, switching menus all seem fine.  There is some lag for the camera to load images from the gallery and open the editor, but again, this is not a flagship phone.Using my USB-C power meter, I was able to find out that the phone will draw a maximum of approx. 17W while charging.  It’s not a fast-charging phone, but still reasonable.Battery runtime on the phone dropped approx. 10% when performing the benchmark tests.  After approx. 4 days, with light usage taking photos, moving around on the phone menus and setting it up, watching YouTube and listening to music, the battery finally dropped down to approx. 14%.  All that time the phone was connected to WiFi but had no SIM card.  The phone seems to drop almost 6-8% every day while on standby with the screen off and minimal to no use.Durability Test:I tested the ruggedness of the phone by performing a couple tests, a water dunk as well as a drop test.  This always makes me nervous but it needs to be done.I was probably more worried about the water dunk test because of the issue with the SIM tray cover popping open on its own after some time.  If water was going to get in, this is where it will happen.  Luckily, the cover has been staying closed for longer with more use and me pressing down on it every time I use the phone.  This is definitely something that needs to be addressed in the factory.For the water test, I filled a container full of water and dropped the phone in while it was recording a video.  I was happy to see that it successfully passed the dunk test.  The touch screen worked but did have some recognition issues when I touched the screen while there were water drops moving around on the screen.  I needed to wipe off some of the water before it registered my swipes.  The speaker was probably the only thing affected by the water as it cut the audio volume way down.  Luckily, this was only temporary as once the water was cleared out (or dried up) the output volume returned.The drop test was next.  This is always an iffy one, if the design is lacking then that means the phone will crack/break and that’s it for the phone.I setup the phone in my kitchen at approx. countertop height (36”) and started the recording on the phone.  I held it on the corner to try to get the phone impact the hard tile floor on its edge.  The phone drops and it struck the corner and survived.  Looking at the phone I could see a ding on the corner/edge.  On closer inspection, the dent was at the top edge towards the screen and there was a dent.  It moved closer to the glass, but not enough to cause an issue.  The phone was still working, and the video was still recording, so it looks like it withstood the abuse.Pros:- IP68 & MIL-SPEC 810H Certified for water/dust resistance and drop/impact resistance.- Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen glass.- Very nice looking design with an all-aluminum frame.- Comfortable to hold with the rounded edges.- Durable, can take a drop from at least countertop height onto hard tile with only a scuff/dent in the frame but the phone was still 100% functional.- Supports a MicroSD card up to 256GB for added storage.- Surprisingly comes with a USB-C charging adapter & USB-C to USB-C charging cable.  Not only that, it also comes with a small USB-C to USB-A dongle so you can plug your phone into any computer/wall adapter using the USB-A connector.  This is definitely a welcomed bonus.- Not as heavy as expected at only 258g as current flagship phones are slightly lighter but can’t take a hit like this phone.- Photo quality from its main 12MP camera (not actually 48MP) is actually not bad.- Audio is fairly loud for a single down firing speaker.- Decent battery runtimeCons:- One major QC fail is with the SIM Tray cover.  It’s supposed to keep the device watertight, but unfortunately, there’s a design issue or a problem with the one on my phone as it doesn’t stay inserted into the phone.  I noticed this when I opened the box but just thought it was left that way during packing, but after approx. 20mins, the cover pops completely open exposing the innards to water, dust and dirt.  QC definitely needs to be improved at the factory to prevent major issues like this.- The back cover is plastic, which helps its impact resistance, but I found knocking on it, it sounded a bit hallow.- OS is limited to Android 11 and doesn’t look like it will be getting any more security updates.- Processor is a few years old, so not the best performer.- Front selfie camera quality lacking in normal light conditions.  Photos are usable but has a lot of noise.  Better quality appears when photos taken on a very sunny day.- No 3.5mm headphone jack that is available on other rugged phones.- Camera is marketed as a 48MP camera, but it’s actually a 12MP sensor, so a bit misleading.- Videos taking using the main rear camera only records at 1080p @ 2.1MP, which produces average quality images with a lot of noise.- Front camera can’t take proper videos in Portrait orientation.  The video is compressed so items seem wider than they should be.  It does work fine in Landscape orientation, so a problem with the camera or software.Final Impression:Overall, the CAT S62 rugged phone worked well.  Comfortable to hold, doesn’t look like a rugged phone, but capable of being dunked in water and dropped onto the floor without major damage (slight ding).  It’s not a gaming phone or anywhere near a flagship but if you don’t have a flagship phone next to it to compare, the phone does work fairly well opening/switching apps, watching videos and moving around on the phone menus.  Photos aren’t the best but is actually ok.  Videos on the other hand are a bit sub-par in my opinion.  The major flaw for my phone was the issue with the SIM slot cover opening up on its own after some time.  This can really affect its waterproof status and damage the phone, so better QC is definitely required.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Olivier', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on April 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Nice phone.

I purchased the Nokia for the sole reasoning to improve my habits of staring at that shattered glass screen for an unnecessary amount of time when I need that time to be productive and, well, connect with the world. But anyway, here are my pros and cons I noticed while using this phone over the weekend. (And some things to clarify after reading other reviews)Pros:-Calls sound good and you sound good on their end-SMS/MMS texts pop up on their end-All the advertised apps appeared and work decently (YouTube, Google Search/Maps, WhatsApp, QR Reader)-Snake is a classic as well as Crossy Road and Doodle Jump-FM Radio works well and sounds good too-Loaded music files via microSD storage all play seemlessly either with headphones or BluetoothCons:-No physical volume buttons, which kinda bothers me a little-Internet browser is very limited even when loading simple websites-Your group text responses send to each group member individually instead of the group (bug?)-Google Maps is text/manual navigation only for those who only rely on its voice assistant-Camera quality is fine but not the best for indoor photos-The promised apps will only show up if you insert the SIM card to the phone (makes sorta sense but not so much for WIFI only users)Transferring the SIM over from one phone to this one was simple. Since I have an iPhone, before using your SIM on the Nokia, go to the settings and uncheck your number to receive iMessages from (on Messages tab in the main Settings menu). After that, you should be able to send SMS and MMS messages from your Nokia at an ease.Well, that\'s about it! This phone, overall, is a 4/5 in my book. It is not entirely perfect, some flaws to be aware but a good phone to use overall. A good way to disconnect from the loud world every once in a while, or to slowly improve screen time. Probably both. I\'d recommend this to anyone, like me, who wants a backup phone to use, a replacement to ditch your smartphone entirely (you brave soul), or to parents who want their kids to get their first phone. Get yourself a cheap prepaid phone plan and begin that journey with this beloved little gadget.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nataly Marentes', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Eficiente', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Mi mamá necesitaba un buen celular que tuviera forma de conectar a internet y este fue el indicado no es difícil de manejar al contrarios es fácil para cuando no sabes manejar un celular táctil recomendado\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'abeer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on June 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Good price with good quality\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rechot', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very good\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 27, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Bought this phone as advertised with WhatsApp, wanted to reduce my social media use with a more basic phone.

Priced at less than £130, it offers a feature set that’s hard to beat in this price range. It’s definitely on the chunkier side, which gives it a bit of heft, but that\'s a good thing for a phone that\'s built to withstand the rough and tumble of outdoor adventures or demanding work environments.One of the standout features here is the durability. The phone is IP68/IP68K rated, meaning it\'s both waterproof and dustproof, and it boasts MIL-STD-810H certification, so it\'s designed to handle drops up to 1.5 meters and withstand extreme temperatures. If you\'re the type who’s constantly on the move or working in tougher conditions, this phone is built to take it.In terms of performance, the 12GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage ensure smooth multitasking, and if you need more space, you can expand it up to 1TB with a memory card. The 6000mAh battery is another strong point, providing ample power to get through a full day of heavy use, which is a must for a phone designed for outdoor use. Plus, the OTG reverse charge feature means you can use it as a power bank in a pinch, which is a handy bonus.The 6.53"" FHD+ display is clear and bright, making it easy to use outdoors, though it\'s not quite on par with more premium OLED screens. The 20MP camera is decent for general use and takes good photos in well-lit conditions, but don\'t expect it to match up to higher-end phones in terms of image quality, especially in low light.There are a few trade-offs to consider. The phone only supports 4G, and it uses older Bluetooth 4.2 technology, which might be a drawback if you\'re looking for the latest connectivity features. Also, the extra weight and size might not suit everyone, especially if you’re used to slimmer devices.Overall, the UMIDIGI BISON X20 is a great option for those needing a tough, reliable smartphone without a hefty price tag. It has its quirks, but the combination of rugged features, solid performance, and a very reasonable price point makes it a strong contender in the budget rugged phone market.I’d give this product 4 out of 5 stars. It offers excellent value for money and does what it promises, though it comes with some compromises in terms of weight and some features.\nRead more'}]",,B0DHRN8421,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0DHRN8421,4g

Located just above the USB port and doubling as your home button, this is a nice touch, it's easy to find and unlocks your device quickly as well as allowing you to authenticate purchases using Google Pay and the Google Play store and for any other apps that require biometric authentication.I love the leather feel on the back, which gives it that premium feel without the premium price tag.  I went for the Marsh Mellow Blue colour, but the red one is also very fetching and the clear case that comes with it is a clear pastic, so nice to show off without the back getting finger marked or scratched.Just beware the plug that comes with this though, mine came with an EU plug in the box and is meant for retail in mainland Europe, however Motorola assure me that regardless, software updates will come through at the same time as if I'd bought it in the UK.  One nice touch is that mine also came with a car charger, so if you're planning to hit the road, you'll be ready for that too.All in all very happy apart from the EU plug thing, though genuine Motorola chargers are available on Amazon, my recommended option is the 50W charger with dual port USB C and USB A, that way you can charge an extra accessory like headphones from the same socket.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'smarttvminix', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Singapore on February 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Overall robust performance.. volte supported for starhub network.

Bark has that of course but this one also does monitoring of stuff like their text and photos which is great. Thats a plus cause I don\'t have time to check my sons device every day. And I\'d like him to have some freedom and accountability so he can learn to make good choices and manage his time well with some extra guide rails. Since the Bark phone is a real phone I let him explore the real world but still know what he\'s up to and help him create healthy boundaries and limits for his use.Got a case for it as well because...you know kids. But since its just a Samsung A14 there are lots of options out there - even an Otter Box if I have to thought thats a bit pricey.The only bummer is in group chats with friends he\'s the ""green kid"". Of course thats true with all of the kid phones out there - thanks Apple! Hopefully one day Apple will be more compatible with the rest of the world.Also should note, it doesn\'t come with a wall wort/brick/butt. Its got a USB-C to USB-C cable which is compatible with most USB charging bricks and laptops.

Of course. I dare say, it\'s better than the ""haha"" I had hoped it would give me, and gave me the ""please be more than useable"" I really wanted.The TL;DR is IT WORKS. ITS FUN. ITS TINY. ITS AMAZING. BUY THIS PHONE, THE PRICE IS WORTH IT. Seriously. I\'m so extremely elated to own a tiny phone like this that can do most everything I expected from it.To start, the screen. It\'s tiny, yes, but it\'s also looks pretty good. Peel off the manufacturer\'s fuzzy screen protector, and you have a serviceable screen. At that size, you need a high enough resolution that gives you clarity, and this phone delivers. Also, the text all seem to be manipulated by a custom android OS made to give legibility and formatting to work on the small screen. Chrome and other apps were all sized and formatted in a way that everything was easy to read, no need to zoom.You might think typing is difficult on the screen, but my secret weapon for you is Gboard. Download the keyboard from the Play store, and turn on Glide. Boom, you can now swipe/Swype/glide with ease. I typed my typical book-long messages to my viewers in Discord with ease. Hangouts? No issues. Side note: there is a custom keyboard in it, it might have glide/Swype, but I didn\'t use it. Gboard is my jam, so I went with that.I downloaded quite a few apps for this phone, and some intensive games. They all ran acceptably, but a few stuttered. Honestly, if you want to game hardcore, you\'re looking at the wrong phone. Emulating with a Bluetooth controller, though? Chefs kiss, babay, it handles the classics of the 16 bit era quite well. Definitely a nice teeny pocket handheld. And, hey, Alto\'s Adventure ran beautifully.Quick tip: use Nova Launcher and give it a more traditional Android look, it\'ll make the phone feel more complete. It runs perfectly with a custom launcher.The typical features of a phone were all FINE on this. Great volume, strong vibrate, the Bluetooth worked wonderfully to make this an MP3 player, and so on. The cameras on the front and back are pretty low quality in low light, but they snapped acceptable pics. You\'ll be wanting a different device for higher quality photos, come on. Battery life is great. Full charge in an hour, idled on for three days without dying. I left it sitting at 75 percent, from me playing on it for about 45 minutes. It might not be an all day phone using it nonstop, but the faster charge is nice.Phone calls were great. If you don\'t want to hold a tiny phone, use Bluetooth. I used it, with zero issue, perfect call quality. Any bad areas in town were still bad areas with this phone, but that\'s to be expected.Oh, also, it came with all the goodies. A screen protector. Charging cable. Sim card slot puller. AND A CUTE LITTLE CASE.I use a Note 20 Ultra as my daily phone. I used this for 5 days straight, and will keep carrying it around, along with that behemoth. I\'m in love with it. It\'s ridiculous, you know this. But, it\'s actually serviceable, if you need a small alternative. Will it fit every situation? Maybe not. But it\'ll most likely fill yours, if you\'re here. The price is about right, in my humble opinion.I will be posting a video of my time with it elsewhere, keep an eye out for Havok Versus Everything, or find me just to chat. I will yell about how much I love this thing.If you have any more questions, ask in the question section and I will answer the best I can. There\'s too much to say, and a lot of intricacies to owning a phone I might not have thought of off the top of my head. I got ya, just ask.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MW', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'DOES NOT EORK ON CRICKET OR AT&T AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT IN ENGLISH', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The words on the phone screen are NOT in ENGLISH!!!!

This really is more of a fun thing I like to do for my long term clients whom I'm also fond of.The beauty of AOSP is that it is basically the Open Source side of Android development that any Phone Maker or Carrier can custom configure for their purposes which lean, in some cases, pretty heavily towards personal Data Collection, by running many things in the background which cause most cell phone to constantly be active thereby oft running hot and emitting constant EMF (microwave) frequencies, reducing battery life, reducing their lifespan and well, in essence frying us a little bit to hear it told.So the beauty of AOSP based cell phones is that many of the Apps that otherwise run in the background, can be disabled for the most part, leaving only Apps that each user needs and thus lowering EMFs, reducing temperature, increasing battery life and duty as well increasing phone lifespan. Ok enough tech talk...Enter the NUU A25. This is a lovely phone with good specs, a beautiful screen and priced at what I think makes it one of the best dollar values for a phone of this caliber to be had here in the States at $150.NUU states that the phone will NOT work on Consumer Cellular but where I abide, Consumer Cellular is on the AT&T network and so my test NUU A25 works beautifully without an issue I can find. The phone instantly and perfectly activated the moment I powered the phone back on after installing the SIM card!I personally loved AOSP Android 10 due to it's simplicity, configurability, beauty and ease of use etc > fast forward to today and the latest Android OS' have so many silly waste of time things as well a big reduction in Beauty and attractiveness in the Interface but this NUU A25 with Android 13 is Lovely! Crisp icons, visuals are excellent and then add to this the AMOLED screen and you've a wonderful phone that is most enjoyable to use for the most part. NUU even thru in some attractive theme options that add to the improved use and attractiveness of the device. Also fixed up the phone with what looks like an excellent camera with lots of configuration options and pretty high resolution!I know this is a sticky topic but in my area, most people are NOT in favor of 5G, feeling that it does not serve the spread out nature of the area as well is considered quite toxic in terms of EMF and personal health. I can't site an studies around this but because my clients are concerned, I am also concerned and the NUU A25 appears to be a 4G phone without ability with 5G and I noticed when working on the phone that my hand does Not ache the way it does when I have to work on a 5G phone.Overall, I am very pleased and consider this one of the best Phone values at $150 there is and encourage you all to give it a try, remembering that there are a lot of carrier issues everywhere so your experience might Not be as good as mine so please consider NOT diss NUU if this happens to you. Fact is cell phone makers can only accommodate so many carriers in each device.And NUU, you all did a great job on this phone, well done but please keep the price so it stays one of the best values there is and please keep making these and offering them on Amazon with Android13!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Zed', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Bought this for gaming, love it.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I got tired of my daily driver, a Pixel 6a, being crammed full everytime I updated PubG and CoD. I saw this and decided to take a chance and it paid off immediately. As long as you care about keeping the highest frame rate, it's competitively responsive.My Pixel 6a Google Tensor hardware has it outmatched in picture quality, but the Nuu A25 has twice the framerate (60 fps vs 120 fps). The touchscreen on the A25 is more accurate and responsive than the Pixel 6a's weird touchscreen.Because of this, games are just fun now. The frustrating days of a small screen and questionable touch sensitivity are behind me as I can give my Pixel 6a a break.I was also very pleased to see the clear case in the box and noticed that it came with the screen protector factory installed. I wish all manufacturers did that because I detest how prone screen protectors are to trapped bubbles and show dust/lint despite fastidious pre-cleaning.I haven't bothered to put a sim card in. I use it on wifi or mobile hotspot.My only complaint is that there is no stereo sound output from the phone itself. It has a single speaker at the bottom edge of the phone, so I recommend headphones. It plays well with my Anker Soundcore earbuds so I'm satisfied with that. If I do decide to use the 3.5mm jack, I will just use a headphone preamp anyway.That being said, it does what I want it to do and meets my needs. It's an impressive piece of kit at an excellent price. Five stars for the capabilities at the price point.I recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable mobile phone to scratch the gaming itch. You can't find better at this price and it's got enough hardware grunt where it counts in FPS type games.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'RhythmJunky', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A lot to like, a few niggling faults', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The good: Battery life is good. Fairly heavy use gets through most of the day. Light use could go 2 - 3 days. Wifi and cellular connectivity is good. I got this when I gave up trying to fix my old phone, a Moto G Stylus 2022 4G. It kept disconnecting from my network and I sent it in for warrantee repair. The Nuu a25 has a much brighter and more vivid display than the moto G Stylus. The phone is also quite snappy, having a good responsiveness in most cases.What could be better: The touch input has had issues here and there. If I touch the power button to turn the display off and on again it fixes this issue. The fingerprint reader is iffy sometimes. And there have been a couple of times when I had to enter my pin due to too many attempts even though the phone was only in my shirt pocket and I wasn't attempting anything. Then there is the speaker. It is certainly adequate but not as loud as the Moto G Stylus. Sometimes voices sound just a tad muffled.The verdict: This is, in my opinion, a better phone than similar offerings from Motorola in the same price range. Definitely a solid 4 stars.

Mein Mann ist insgesamt zufrieden mit dem CUBOT Kingkong X, da es ein robustes und leistungsstarkes Smartphone ist. Der riesige Akku hält durchaus 2-3 Tage, und das große Display macht die Bedienung angenehm. Ein kleiner Nachteil ist, dass er entweder zwei SIM-Karten ohne Speicherkarte oder nur eine SIM-Karte und eine Speicherkarte verwenden kann, aber nicht 2 SIM Karten und eine Speicherkarte gleichzeitig. Die 100MP-Kamera liefert ordentliche Fotos, auch wenn die Bildqualität nicht überragend ist – für den Preis ist das jedoch absolut in Ordnung.

Da sottolineare le foto in notturna che sono ben oltre la media.Il display secondario nella parte posteriore del telefono, molto raro in prodotti di questa fascia di prezzo, è utile e lo rende elegante ma anche da avventura. Ci poi vedere il calendario, vedere le notifiche ma ti offre anche la possibilità di controllare la camera anteriore e quindi fare selfie a 100 megapx.La batteria usando il kingkng X in maniera intensiva dura circa 5 giorni.La memoria Rom di 16 + 16 lo rende velocissimo in tutte le operazioni e 256 gb di Ram ti fanno scordare la necessità di inserire una memoria SD.La connettività è 5G e la velocità di connessione a internet dipende dal posto dove ti trovi e dall'operatore telefonico.Il software è Android 14, praticamente, Stock e non contiene app non richieste e disinstallabili come in molti altri prodotti di questo tipo.Decisamente interessante anche il prezzo per uno smartphone di queste caratteristiche.L'unica cosa alla quale bisogna abituarsi è il peso ma con una batteria da oltre 10000 mAh e tutte queste caratteristiche è più che normale.Posso finalmente fare passeggiate con il cane in montagna e passare nei corsi d'acqua senza la paura di rovinare il telefono.Spero di essere stato utile.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mamen GF', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on August 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nEs un verdadero monstruo de rendimiento y resistencia.

Well, I broke it trying it myself. LOL. So I needed a new phone, and didn't want another Moto (it already got its one and only Android update) so I heard good things about this Samsung. It has 5G (though not at my house, but I never really leave, and on US Mobile w/their Verizon SIM, wifi works perfectly for calls, SMS, & even MMS).This Samsung has a lower resolution display than the Moto had (720p vs. 1080p), but I don't even notice. This phone is MUCH brighter (the Moto was so dim, even on high, so awful when outside). The cameras are very nice on this, with fun features, & the macro camera is much better then the Moto's. I did prefer the tiny hole punch front facing camera on the Moto, though.The fingerprint reader works quicker and more accurately than the Moto. And this has a bigger battery, which is nice.The Moto came with Android 10 and upgraded to 11 (and that's it). This came with 11, 12 will be here in a couple weeks, and it will eventually get 13, so even though this phone came out a year ago, I'm happy about the updates it'll get.

The quick start guide is pointless.  For example, I got this so that I could expand the memory with an SD card.  The ""quick start"" has NO mention of where that might go.  No hint at all.  The first thing you\'re supposed to do, according to the front side of the quick start guide is put in a SIM card.  Um...  huh?  Where is THAT? The reverse of that page tells you if you want help, get premium care service.  Go to THAT page and they won\'t let you go further until you enter numbers that you can ONLY obtain by turning the phone on and going to another page (which they do NOT tell you how to get to).  This is not a phone for anyone who doesn\'t set up phones for a living.UPDATE, hour later:  I managed to find a number to talk to Samsung.  The first person gave me a couple of not very helpful factoids, then pretended to  no longer hear me and I think hung up.  She also could apparently only speak in mumble, despite pleas to speak clearly.  A survey came on, asked about my experience, and refused to take the lowest score (so don\'t believe Samsung customer satisfaction ""results"").  The second person -- and be aware that each of these calls puts you through a wait period -- was helpful at least, but the jargon was pretty dense and I\'m more confused than ever and don\'t feel there were very many straight answers.  He might have thought they were...  but the jargon made it very difficult to figure out.  I finally just gave up asking questions.  We did ""set up"" the phone, but skipped a LOT of steps which he assured me I could take care of later...  but it is something I\'m going to have to figure out, apparently, on my own.  I am facing an extremely steep learning curve.  I have no idea how anything is supposed to get from the old phone to the new one -- he says maybe but I don\'t think we did anything to  transfer any data let alone files or apps.He claimed that they don\'t send out instructions in order to protect the environment.  Balderdash:  he told me also to print out the instructions he emailed.Finally, this is pretty slow -- much slower than my old Motorola.  And the touchscreen is mercurial.

You can also go the used phone route and pick like an iPhone or Samsung that\'s about three to five years old for this price range (under $200). But if you want something brand new and shiny, then there is pretty much one option, and that\'s generic phones from China. I have already reviewed a couple Doogee phones, and find them very decent phones for their price range, and this one is no different. What is different though, is that this phone right now as of me writing this review, has a $60 off coupon which turns the phone to only $130 plus tax. And for all the features and ""phone"" that you get from this, this is such an excellent value.First, I really like that they did not skimp on the specs, so you get 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of memory. Don\'t be fooled by the 20GB faux advertising - the extra 12GB is just virtual memory and doesn\'t behave like a phone with actual 20GB of RAM would. To sum it up simply, it allows you to have more apps open without them having to refresh/restart when you switch back to them, but doesn\'t make the phone any faster.The camera is decent if you shoot during the day or in situations with really good lighting. At night, it gets very soft and ""smushy"", or pixelated like a bad quality video stream. Good for posting on Facebook where they will smush the heck out of your photos anyways.I would extra recommend this phone if you have a business or situation where you wouldn\'t need this phone is your primary phone. It can be your business phone where the main goal is communication, and not like all the extra fun stuff you\'d do on your expensive phone. Or perhaps you need a burner phone for your nefarious ways and lifestyle. Then if something were to happen, being out $130 isn\'t so bad. It\'s especially great if you need to travel overseas and want that second phone as a peace of mind.\nRead more'}]",15.07537688442211,B0D41NPTN6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D41NPTN6,4g

It can do so much.  I was an Apple products user for 14 years.  Had the iphone, Macbook, ipads, and apple watch but decided to get a new phone.  My iphone is still working, just wanted a change, and after doing lots of research, I came to find the Galaxy Z Fold 3.  I did my research on that but did not want to spend money on the full priced new version if I did not like it, so I decided to look for refurbished and new ones.  I got this one as like new, and when I got it, other than two little dents on the edge of the phone, the rest of the phone looked and performed as close to new.  I love this device.  It is great for multitasking, for design and art, and for reading or viewing purposes.  The camera quality is not the greatest but it is still really good compared to other phones.  The sound is amazing, and the screen quality is good, plus gaming on it is a blast.  The only downsize to the device is the battery can drain pretty quick when unfolded which is to be expected from a device with two screens that operate in that manner.  Other than that, the charging takes less than two hours with the right wire and charging port.  Amazon did a top notch job with the resell of a used electronics.  If the dents were not in the phone, I would honestly think it was brand new.  But the small dents to me were something I barely cared about because I put a very durable case on it as soon as I could and I barely take it off to see the issues on the phone.  I highly recommend to anyone who wants to get one, to do so through Amazon refurbish, or used selections.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'The Magic Hands Man', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Let's play SPIN THAT WHEEL!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Okay folks, today marks day 1 of ordering a refurbished phone. On the one hand the primeday price was a sweet 800 bucks, not bad at all. On the other hand it seems we are spinning the wheel and here are some of the choices.1. You get a phone that does not charge2. You get a phone does not turn on3. You get a phone that is still locked4. You get a phone that comes damaged5. You get a phone that is actually fine. It looks great.Based on the averages MOST people get a perfectly fine phone. You are just unlucky if you get a busted on. That said you have to be vigilant when you order one of these suckers. First thing inspect like crazy, and try to charge. So far there was a slight scuff near the center of the hinge, looks just a bit dirty. Also it charges, so win so far. I am going to attempt to tranfer some data and move my number over, so in the next few days I will see how it goes and will probably come back with more updates.Do note that it is good of us to TRY and recycle phones and stuff. It\'s better for the world and all that jazz. Me I just wanted to save some money, which may or may not bite me in the ass later.Oh and just to let everyone interested in this phone know, google searches will confirm that these phones do have issues with the middle screen getting cracks and dead pixels regardless of what you do. Samsung is also TRYING ACTIVELY to not pay for any of these. It seems if you buy the samsung care plus they take care of it MOST of the time. That said their website providing information on the care plus is confusing and seems pretty useless.I did splurge on a heavy duty case because I just want to make sure that I am protecting the screens as much as possible. I am also going to try a stylus and see how that goes.Day 1- Phone looking good, turns on, charges, samsung transfer app works well android to android. So far so good.Day 16- Very glad I bought that heavy duty case because this phone is attracted to the floor. Stuff did manage to get under the case but overall it\'s working well. Battery life on the phone is okay overall. If you use your phone a lot, you will be charging it everyday. Tablet mode drains it pretty fast it seems. I charged it to about 90, then read novels in firefox for about 3 hours and it dropped to 50 percent. This is not a phone you want to use if you are going to be away from a charger for a long period of time. Don\'t get trapped on an island with it. Besides that I am really enjoying the phone. It has a super awesome refresh rate, I picked up a stylus which was pretty nice for the big screen (note the small screen doesn\'t accept any stylus). It is amazing for reading books or comics, watching movies or tv shows. It feels like a really nice small tablet.One of the problems I can already forsee is that this is a 1-2 year phone as opposed to 3-4 phone like I normally buy. You are most likely going to want the newest one when it comes out assuming it doesn\'t explode note style. Also having a protective case is nice, but man this phone is now Thiccc. Also some apps do NOT like going from the small screen to the big screen and will literally crash because resizing hurts their brains. Most are of mine are fine but a few do crash.On a plus side besides the awesome refresh rate which makes this feel like a real fancy phone, it is a big talking piece and even without me shoving this in peoples faces like pictures of my children, people come up to me and say ""Oh, you are making me want a new phone.""  Let\'s hope my luck keeps going.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Anthony L Jordan', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Z fold 3 is supposed to be waterproof', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024', 'Review Body': ""the phone I got was not properly refurbished which eliminated the waterproof feature the phone is supposed to have...

The screen is sharp and readable even in the sun.  It's a very snappy phone doesn't seem to lag or hang up etc.  The camera is amazing.

Parker', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The camera is the main reason to buy this phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2022', 'Review Body': ""Pros: The camera is one of the best on the market and consistently delivers very nice photos, sometimes amazing photos. If getting high quality photos with your cell phone is important to you, that is the primary reason to own this phone. Since it is made by Google, it offers top of the line support for all Google products and apps.Cons: for some inexplicable reason, this phone consumes a lot more battery life with certain apps like Life 360, than other phones. My family was all using that app and my phone was just getting crazy battery drain compared to all the other phones using that app. So I had to actually stop using that app with this phone. I will say that when playing games and using most normal apps the battery life is fine but certain apps can drain the battery in a bad way. So you have to be careful and keep an eye on battery usage. If you notice your battery is going low and see if certain apps might be the culprit.Another con is that this phone actually can get really hot when you're taking video or doing other things like heavy GPS use with some apps like Waze it heats up also. The heat up when taking video is so bad that you really don't want to use it out in the sun when it's over 95° f. Because it could actually get so hot. It warns you it's overheating and it's actually uncomfortable to hold in your hands which is not good for the life of the phone I'm sure. So living in Texas this maybe isn't the best phone if you want to take photos or videos outside during the day in the summer. But if you live in a colder climate, that's probably not an issue.The on-screen fingerprint reader honestly sucks and normally I just have to renter my pin since it only recognizes my fingerprint less than half the time. I don't use that facial recognition unlock since it's rather insecure.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Henry Przygocki', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Google Pixel 6 - A Hidden Gem at an Unbeatable Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023', 'Review Body': ""Despite the initial negative buzz surrounding the Google Pixel 6, I took the leap and purchased this smartphone, and I'm thrilled with my decision. The Pixel 6 is an incredible device that offers remarkable value for the price. Due to the device's rocky launch, its price has been lowered, making it even more attractive.Let me assure you that this phone performs flawlessly. I've been using it for several months now, and it has never let me down. The battery life is impressive, easily lasting me a couple of days depending on my use. The overall speed and performance are exceptional, and the software is top-notch. The camera is a standout feature, capturing stunning photos and videos. Additionally, the ample storage of the 256GB version is more than sufficient for my needs.While some people have complained about the fingerprint reader, I find it to be a minor inconvenience. It may take a fraction of a second longer than flagship phones, but it quickly becomes second nature. As a power user who enjoys customization, I appreciate the versatility of the Pixel 6. It handles demanding tasks and even some gaming with ease. For the price, I couldn't find a better smartphone on the market. It's truly a hidden gem.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Donny L', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on January 23, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The Google Pixel 6 is a flagship phone that offers a lot of value for its price. It has a unique and attractive design, a powerful and custom-made processor, and an impressive camera system. It also runs on the latest Android 13 OS, which is fast, smooth, and secure.The phone has a 6.4-inch OLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 1080 x 2340 resolution. The screen is bright, sharp, and colorful, and it adapts to the ambient light and the content. The screen also has a hole-punch cutout for the 8MP selfie camera, which can take wide-angle shots and supports face unlock.The phone's back is made of glass and has a matte finish that resists fingerprints. The most distinctive feature of the phone is the camera bar, which houses the 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultra-wide camera. The camera bar also has a metal accent that contrasts with the color of the phone. The phone comes in three colors: Stormy Black, Sorta Seafoam, and Kinda Coral[^1^][1].The phone's performance is powered by the Google Tensor processor, which is the first chip designed by Google for Pixel phones. The processor is optimized for AI and machine learning tasks, such as image processing, language translation, and voice recognition. The processor also works with the Titan M2 security chip, which protects the phone from malware and hackers. The phone has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which are enough for most users.The phone's camera is one of the best in the market, thanks to the Google Tensor processor and the software features. The main camera has a large sensor that captures more light and detail, especially in low-light situations. The ultra-wide camera has a 114-degree field of view, which is great for landscapes and group shots. The phone also has a 4x optical zoom and a 7x digital zoom, which are decent but not outstanding.The phone's camera has many modes and features that enhance the photos and videos, such as Night Sight, Portrait Mode, Magic Eraser, Motion Mode, and Cinematic Pan. The phone can also record 4K videos at 60fps, and 1080p videos at 240fps. The phone's camera can also recognize and translate text, identify objects, and suggest actions, thanks to the Google Lens feature.The phone's battery is 4614mAh, which can last for a full day of moderate use. The phone supports fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging. The phone can charge up to 50% in 30 minutes with the 30W adapter, which is sold separately. The phone can also charge other devices, such as earbuds or smartwatches, by placing them on the back of the phone.The phone's software is Android 13, which is the latest and most advanced version of the OS. The software is clean, smooth, and intuitive, and it has many features that make the phone smarter and more helpful. For example, the phone has a Live Translate feature, which can translate speech and text in real time, even without an internet connection. The phone also has a Hold for Me feature, which can wait on hold for you when you call a customer service line. The phone also has a Personal Safety feature, which can detect car crashes, falls, or emergencies, and alert your contacts or emergency services.The phone's connectivity is also excellent, as it supports 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, and eSIM. The phone can connect to the fastest and most reliable networks, and it can also share its 5G connection with other devices. The phone also has a dual SIM feature, which allows you to use two different phone numbers or carriers on the same phone.The phone's drawbacks are minor, but they are worth mentioning. The phone does not have a microSD card slot, which means you cannot expand the storage. The phone also does not have a headphone jack, which means you have to use wireless earbuds or an adapter. The phone also does not have a fingerprint scanner, which means you have to use face unlock or a PIN code. The phone also does not have a water resistance rating, which means it may not survive a splash or a dunk.I think the Google Pixel 6 is a fantastic phone that offers a lot of value for its price. It has a unique and attractive design, a powerful and custom-made processor, and an impressive camera system. It also runs on the latest Android 13 OS, which is fast, smooth, and secure. It has some minor drawbacks, but they are not deal-breakers. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars rating.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mariel Rivera', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'En éste momento hay aspectos a considerar, por el precio recomiendo buscar opciones como el pixel 7 o 7 pro, ya que no hay mucha diferencia de precio.

The phone was in excellent conditions almost like new. It has very minor scratches on one corner of the screen, but they are almost invisible.

Mine is charging perfectly, but just to be on the safe side, I ordered on Amazon a wireless charger, so I don't have to worry about the charging port, it was only $17, so worth it! As soon as I turned on the phone,  I received the Android 11 update and other security patches, this was a pleasant surprise. LG has committed to update this phone up to Android 12. I am using the LG V60 on the T-Mobile network and it works beautifully. I have wifi calling and I get connected to 5g when it's available. I use the cheap prepaid T-Mobile Connect plan and I haven't experienced network deprioritization just because I am on a prepaid plan. I presume this phone will work just as well with Mint mobile or other GSM MVNOs.  I also happened to have a European SIM card and tried it on the phone. I can attest that this phone is truly unlocked, as I immediately got the network using a SIM card that I bought in Italy. If you are on the fence about buying this phone, just order it, you won't be disappointed and if for some reasons you don't like it, you are still covered by the 90 day return policy.

Baek', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'BTS theme + mini SD slot', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2021', 'Review Body': 'Welp, as we all now know, Samsung is experimenting with going the way of Apple with hard limits to storage space. Shame. I originally bought this phone to upgrade from an S9+ which had been working fine until I dropped it and the screen cracked. I could probably have replaced the screen easily but the BTS theme was enough to convince me to upgrade. The hologram purple back is a beaut and I still get compliments on it. Ofc it\'s usually safely tucked under a protective (now dull, less transparent) case, but it still shines through.I\'m glad I got this phone as opposed to waiting for the S21 bc one of the main reasons I switched to Android was for the ease of adding more storage and moving files to/fro the phone to a computer. So far, I still love my phone and have never really experienced any more connectivity issues compared to my last few phones (iPhone 8+, Galaxy S9+). The speed of switching btw one app to another, one function to another, has never felt slow for me unless for some reason, an app is not loading (usually the fault of the app). The size of the app is big enough so that sometimes I experience trouble using only one hand but never to the point where I absolutely have to hold it with both hands for most functions. The camera is in the middle of screen instead of a dedicated space at the top so that when you\'re taking fullscreen photos, you will see a ""floating"" black dot but I quickly got over that. Whatever I\'m taking photos of will be towards the center of the screen 98% of the time anyway.To name some cons, one of my main complaints would be smoothness of video while filming but I\'ve noticed this since Galaxy S9+.  Currently I don\'t have a huge need for video so I\'m happy as a clam with this phone. Hoping I won\'t be needing upgrade for a while! So far, nothing new in the phone market has made me consider switching to something else anytime soon.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Austin Timmreck', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2022', 'Review Body': 'So i used to be hard core apple fan.

Also the front facing camera doesnt have that nick that apple does. So the front facing camera takes up very little screen space4 the sellar: now this has nothing to do with the phone, however i feel i need to point out this seller gives a fantastic deal. 600 for a phone and wireless charging pad?!

I held off on the 1 IV because of the overheating issue when it came out, and now I get to experience this phone that is basically a culmination of all the little things that they wanted to do with the line.1. The 4k oled display is gorgeous as usual. The classic Xperia tall slim profile rocks.2. The sound upgrade is amazing and way louder than my 1. The forward facing speakers really make a huge difference to the quality when watching videos or playing games.3. I really appreciate the materials in the back - the textured gorilla glass helps with the fingerprints and grip (But I would probably keep using a phone case just to be extra safe anyway).4. The night-scene ability is better than previous versions and although Sony is a bit slow on this compared to other phones, I'm glad it's finally made its way here.5. The metal edges of the phone feel premium, and the textured buttons only add to that. Again, the shutter button is very unique to this line of phones and the double-press feature makes it work like a dedicated camera.6. Speaking of taking pictures (probably the biggest reason anyone would get this phone), the suite of apps for professional capture and editing is amazing. I'm no professional photographer, but with the official website's quick tutorials, I can pretend like I am.And of course, the headphone jack, the expandable microSD slots, etc.. the list can go on for the small things as well!Some of the disappointing things are:1. So we get a nice bokeh effect now, but still no macro mode.2. Night-scene is a thing, but it's still kind of underwhelming.3. You really do need to know your way around the camera apps to capture great photos. The automatic mode doesn't really do much to impress.I have very few qualms about the quality of this phone. It's a really impressive piece of tech and for me at least, it's a great step up from the original flagship. It might not be worth the price to upgrade from the previous mark IV (especially since they fixed most of the problems that plagued that), but they also lower their price so it could be a worthy investment. All in all, I love this phone so far and I hope to be using it for many years to come.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'AaronM', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Fantastic phone and Camera.  Often called an enthusiast product.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Sony Xperia phones have been my go to for the last 10 years or so. Shape of phone is unique, and others often ask while I\'m using it if it is an ""Xperia"" or ""Sony Pro phone"" due to shape.  People that know, just kinda know and recognize it from reviews.Sony Camera lenses (from Zeiss) are great on the phone and the Sony lack of unneeded apps is very helpful with saving space. This phone accepts my 1 terabyte Micro SD card and allows me to plug in headphones when I need to.  I travel a great deal, so sometimes my headphones don\'t last the whole day.  This is especially true if there is a long delay between long flights.  Sony is great about having LDAC blue tooth which works great with all of Sony\'s best headphones and with my Mark Levinson headphones.  LDAC really does make wireless listening sound better, though wired is usually still best on devices that offer it.  Another reason it is great to have a 3.5 mm port on a phone.The Sony camera software is familiar to anyone familiar with Sony Alpha cameras.  The software is great.  You can use the auto settings for everyday usage when you\'re in a hurry, but you can jump to full SLR mode when you want.  The camera on this phone (like other High end Xperia phones before it) has analog and digital zoom.  As a purist, I like to use the analog zoom more than the digital, but the combination of both is still great when needed.Downsides of this phone?  Only has two microSD/Sim slots.  You can use one SIM and one SD or one two sims.  Previous version allowed two sims and one microSD at the same time.  Doesn\'t affect 95+% of users.  If you regularly travel on two continents, it will though.  Other thing some may not like is lack of case choices.  I was able to find a few I like a lot, but the selection isn\'t as great as latest Samsung or iPhone choices would be.It does seem to be an enthusiast product, but the great features far outweigh the few downsides.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Anonymouse', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Had to send it back. Stunningly awful display exhibits horrific rendering of black / dark images', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I\'ve been brand-loyal to Sony nearly all my life. First Sony product ever owned was a WM-F10 Walkman - that\'s going *way* back. First smartphone: Xperia Z3. Then a XZ Premium. Then a Xperia 1 III. I was heartbroken to see the X1VI was *not* going to get a US release. So I went for the X1V. As unpowered hardware it is gorgeous: textured back and sides, it just feels like a premium product. Was so excited to get it running, I just assumed the same high quality would continue by way of its display. It took a week to realize something was extremely wrong. I noticed that wallpapers looked like they were rendering in low-resolution. Anything dark revealed black crush / pixilation / ""blocky""-ness. But it wasn\'t until I played back films to watch that its unforgivable, wholly unacceptable flaws were on total gross display. I love watching old, vintage horror films. When I played the 1931 Dracula, the aforementioned video defects were sickeningly, glaringly obvious - even more so given the age of that film. NONE of those problems were apparent in my previous Sony phone, the Xperia 1 III. When it dawned on me that there was nothing in the settings that could offer correction, the decision to send it back was painfully clear. I really wanted to own this edition, but after what I viewed - which looked CHEAP - any thought of hanging onto it was made impossible. There was just no justifiable way this phone could be of any further use. This has left me shook. For now, I\'m hanging onto my X1III, which still performs superbly, save for degraded battery over the last 3 years. The crazy thing is, I\'d still give the company a chance to redeem itself, should it decide to re-enter the US market with say, a Xperia 1 VII. That\'s ""loyalty"" for you - and unfortunately the Xperia 1 V is a betrayal, an obscenity to the standard I once held it to.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MIGUEL CERUEDA M', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 31, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Super increíble, llegó antes de que la fecha, con embalaje muy seguro.Un dispositivo de gran calidad, hablando de Sony no existe comparación.\nRead more'}]",28.663330950679054,B0C3WN5JZM,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C3WN5JZM,5g

However, I told them I'd wait some more time to see if the issue reoccur which it has. Also, the process of returning the product then waiting for them to receive it, then waiting for the refund to be processed, then having to reorder, and then wait for the phone to get to me in total would estimate to an entire month or more as I'm not in the US.---I've been encountering some issues with the device shortly after I received it. The phone was delivered on Monday July 16th, and a few days after the set up process I realised that the device started develop latency issues. I also noticed when using the camera, when trying to turn on the flash, the light wouldn't turn on.On Thursday, July 25th the phone camera started to close unexpectedly when being used.On Saturday, July 27th I cleared data in the settings on the camera. On this day, the Amazon app started to close unexpectedly as well while being used, along with other apps while the device froze up.I decided to do a restart of the device which seemed to have corrected the latency issues and issues relating to the apps closing unexpectedly. I waited other week to see if the issues would be recurring.Sunday, August 4th the issues did happen again while using the camera, the apps closing unexpectedly, the is flash not working intermittently, and the device begun freezing and taking me to the lock screen.After restarting the device again on August 4th, I waited and on August 15th nearly exactly 1 month after I've received the the device the exact issue has happened and has carried over to today, August 16th.It appears then I would have to restart my device every 7 days or every week and a half due to whatever defect that's causing it at that very time frame to freeze and close unexpectedly with the apps, especially the camera.Returning and waiting for a refund to reorder again makes no sense as I will not have a phone to use in the interim for a month. And I'm not sure how I'd be able to reorder, without a device to use. Sigh.

After a few weeks, the thing just stopped working.  When powered all the way up, just unplug it and it is dead as a door nail.  It is garbage.  Useless garbage.

The key features we like are the 1 touch dialing (need to press button for 3 seconds) to four preselected phone numbers and the emergency button on the top that you can be set up in a variety of ways. We chose for it to make an alarm sound, that way she knows the SOS has been initiated, then it calls a predetermined number and sends text messages to 4 people just to make certain someone sees her SOS. We attached the lanyard and she keeps this phone with her wherever she goes in the house or yard just in case she falls or has an emergency. We tried porting over an existing cell number but it was a major hassle. It was just easier using the enclosed SIM card with SpeedTalk mobile and their T-Mobile network along with a new cell #. Setup was quick and the plan was only $9/mo. So far it’s working fine!

I bought this because they said it was easy to use for the elderly. Well, not so. It is not completely fool proof for an elderly person with a touch of dementia. There is a sliding on/off feature on the side of the phone that sucks because it is not easy to turn on and off OR her hand will turn it off by accident. The four  easy to dial buttons are okay but there are several reasons why an elderly person would have trouble using them because there is more than one way to answer the phone. An elderly person does not need that option... there should only be one way to answer the phone for an older person like my mom.So, I do not recommend this phone for a person who is elderly. I think I could have designed a better phone for the elderly myself but this is not the one.To be fair it might work if your elderly person has no issues with dexterity.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ines Barraza', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Sirve en Colombia', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Necesito enviar uno a colombia\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gloria A.

I can end the day at 60% vs drained on my last one, even when it was newer.No games or high CPU usage really, just normal app and browsing.This phone is thick, but has a battery that lasts all day (or 2). So it\'s worth it.No bloatware installed, just a pretty basic Android 14 which is great. Do t have 20 branded apps just taking up space and backgrounding.The screen is crisp and clear. Great sized display for most anyone. Text is readable and colors and vivid.The camera is great outdoors, and good indoors. It\'s set at a default of 16gb of ram. You can increase it to 32gb (by adding +16 of swap). But that would mean using 16gb of ufs 3.1 storage for more ""ram"", which is much slower than it\'s chip ddr5, so no point.I do wonder if it\'s actually 16, or if it\'s hard locked to 8ddr5 +8 swap, but it can\'t be changed.Built in storage is awesome at 512M, and has a microsd slot if you want to add another 8gb to 1tb.I do t have anything larger than 1tb to test with, but my Samsung pro 1tb worked just fine.Who needs 1.5tb on a phone? Well, my GoPro does!I can stream 4k video over wifi AC and it doesn\'t struggle.One downside is not having 5G, stuck at 4g. But not a deal killer for me personally.

Mit seinen robusten Features und der leistungsstarken Hardware richtet es sich an Benutzer, die ein zuverlässiges Gerät für Outdoor-Abenteuer, Baustellen oder andere anspruchsvolle Umgebungen benötigen.Design und VerarbeitungDas Kingkong X beeindruckt durch seine robuste Bauweise. Es ist nach IP68 zertifiziert, was bedeutet, dass es staub- und wasserdicht ist und auch bei Stürzen aus geringer Höhe keinen Schaden nimmt. Das Gehäuse besteht aus einer Kombination von Metall und hochfestem Kunststoff, was es besonders widerstandsfähig macht. Die Kanten sind zusätzlich verstärkt, um das Gerät vor Beschädigungen zu schützen, wenn es auf harten Oberflächen landet.

Das Display ist außerdem durch Corning Gorilla Glass geschützt, was es kratzfest und widerstandsfähig gegen Stöße macht. Neben dem Hauptdisplay verfügt das Kingkong X über ein zweites 1,85-Zoll-Display, das nützliche Informationen wie Benachrichtigungen, die Uhrzeit und Wetterdetails anzeigen kann, ohne dass das Hauptdisplay eingeschaltet werden muss.

Il CUBOT Kingkong X sfida questa idea con un dispositivo che non solo è estremamente resistente, ma offre anche specifiche da top di gamma, il tutto a un prezzo competitivo.#### Design e ResistenzaLa prima cosa che colpisce del Kingkong X è la sua robustezza. Questo telefono è progettato per resistere agli ambienti più estremi. Con la certificazione IP68, è impermeabile, resistente alla polvere e può sopportare cadute da altezze notevoli senza battere ciglio. Nonostante il design indistruttibile, CUBOT è riuscita a mantenere un’estetica accattivante. I dettagli in metallo e gomma non solo aumentano la resistenza ma conferiscono anche un look aggressivo e moderno che piacerà a chi cerca un dispositivo dall’aspetto robusto.#### DisplayIl display è un altro punto forte. Il Kingkong X è dotato di uno schermo FHD+ da 6,58 pollici con risoluzione 2.4K, che offre colori vividi e un’ottima luminosità anche sotto la luce diretta del sole. La reattività del touchscreen è impeccabile, il che rende l’esperienza utente fluida, sia durante la navigazione che nella visione di contenuti multimediali.#### Prestazioni e MemoriaSotto il cofano, il Kingkong X non delude. Equipaggiato con Android 14 e supporto per il 5G, è alimentato da un processore abbastanza potente da gestire agevolmente le applicazioni più esigenti. La combinazione di 32GB di RAM e 512GB di storage interno (espandibile fino a 1TB) offre uno spazio di archiviazione praticamente illimitato e permette di gestire il multitasking senza alcun rallentamento. Questo rende il dispositivo ideale per chi ha bisogno di un telefono capace di sostenere un uso intensivo, che sia per lavoro o per divertimento.#### FotocameraLa fotocamera da 100MP è sorprendente, specialmente su un dispositivo rugged. Le immagini scattate sono nitide, con un ottimo bilanciamento dei colori. La fotocamera frontale è più che sufficiente per selfie e videochiamate di qualità. Sebbene non possa competere con le fotocamere dei telefoni di punta delle principali marche, per un rugged phone è davvero impressionante.#### BatteriaL’autonomia è uno degli aspetti più importanti per un telefono rugged, e il Kingkong X eccelle anche qui. La batteria da 10,200 mAh è gigantesca e garantisce tranquillamente due o tre giorni di utilizzo con una sola carica, anche con un uso intensivo. La ricarica rapida a 33W è una gradita aggiunta, che permette di ricaricare il dispositivo in tempi relativamente brevi.#### Funzionalità ExtraIl Kingkong X è dotato anche di NFC, utile per i pagamenti contactless, e di un doppio schermo, una caratteristica piuttosto rara in questa categoria di dispositivi. Il secondo display, situato sul retro, è comodo per vedere notifiche o l’ora senza dover sbloccare il telefono. Inoltre, la doppia SIM 5G rende questo smartphone perfetto per chi viaggia spesso o vuole separare lavoro e vita privata senza dover portare due telefoni.#### ConclusioneIn conclusione, il CUBOT Kingkong X è un vero e proprio mostro di resistenza e prestazioni. Perfetto per chi lavora in ambienti estremi o semplicemente vuole un telefono che possa sopportare qualsiasi cosa senza compromettere l’esperienza utente. Con una durata della batteria eccezionale, un display di alta qualità e una fotocamera sorprendentemente buona, il Kingkong X è un’ottima scelta per chi cerca un dispositivo affidabile e potente.Se cerchi un telefono che possa fare tutto, e farlo bene, senza temere urti, polvere o acqua, il CUBOT Kingkong X è il dispositivo che fa per te.Spero di aver detto tutto e mi auguro che la mia esperienza d'acquisto possa tornarvi utile.Grazie della vostra attenzione.Alla prossima!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Javier Román García', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on August 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Es una auténtica bestia, el móvil conforme lo abres es lo primero que piensas, si le pone un mango tienes un martillo indestructible.El móvil funciona muy muy fluido, se ve de muy buena calidad todo en general.

The unboxing was a lot of fun with the cool packaging design. At first it seems like a plump little phone, but it is so perfectly ergonomic in the hand. The screen protector and clear case are pre-installed which is a great practice. It is easy to hold and easy to pocket in my straight fit pants. I ran 6 miles with it on the first day connected to my Fitbit and it was a great experience. I listened to a podcast, was using GPS, and bluetooth Jlab sport headphones were connected, and it handled it all no problem. Also, it was so nice to have a small device with me as opposed to my giant Moto G G5. The screen is crisp and it will take you a bit to get used to the tiny yet useable scale of the Android and app UI. The phone call quality blows my Moto G series phones away and my wife says I sound great. The speaker phone is very loud and of decent quality. The battery life seems pretty good and should last me a 1 1/2 day with my use of running, podcasts, and communications with family. The fingerprint sensor is so good and is in just the right place on the back of the Jelly. I love the programmable red button, and have it set to Google Assistant so I can ask it to tell me jokes :) If you long press the shortcut button you get the flashlight by default which I love. The keyboard seems ridiculously small but somehow it works well, and I can swipe type pretty easily. The back LED glyph lights seem like a fun gimmick, and they are and bring me joy in how they are used. I did disable them for music, but it is fun to show off for your kids. I love how they notify you when you are charging, receive a notification so you don't need to look at your phone, and have a neat sound paired with them. Also, there is a front notification light that takes me back to my Blackberry days! This phone seems to get out of the way and alerts you without the need to be drawn into your screen. I don't know about the camera quite yet, but I am sure it is a decent enough shooter for my needs at 48 MP. This might be my perfect minimalist phone paired with the Indistractable Launcher. This takes me back to when phones were fun and I am sure you will enjoy it too if you are looking for a tool and to get away from large screen phablets that have taken over and are designed to make us addicted. I hope Unihertz keeps making phones at this sale and add 5g next please.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'An AMZN user', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Love My Tiny Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I have to say I am pleasantly impressed of my new tiny phone. My main concern was keyboard accuracy but surprisingly it's not  an issue no more than a regular-sized phone. It feels great ergonomically in my hands. I can read the screen clearly and it comes already with a screen protector (you get a 2nd one as a spare) and case installed to the phone. You do get a charger block unlike the popular namebrand phones, so there's that too if you need one. The sound quality was better than expected and the speakerphone is VERY LOUD and clear. You can make it even louder in the device settings but the default setting is loud enough imo. I am coming to this phone from a Samsung Z Fold5 which is a $2000 phone and I have to say I see no difference performance-wise between the two. This tiny phone is fast and I haven't experienced any lag or lock ups. I use NFC a lot and it works great if not even faster than my Z Fold5. My Samsung Buds Pro also work perfectly with it with great sound. Finger sensor also works great.I don't really have any cons but I do have a few peeves. The volume button doesn't increase/decrease with holding it down like other phones, so you have to keep pressing it to change it. As expected, the camera quality is not good, it's blurry and off-colored because it's sensitive to indoor lights. Images may have a yellow hue that have to be corrected with custom settings, so you can't just use the default camera settings with this phone. I had to adjust the white balance. You don't buy a $200 mini phone for camera-quality anyway but it's great for just capturing moments. My other peeve is that it runs completely on the Google ecosystem of apps and nothing works without them. I don't like Google so I normally uninstall all their apps when I get an Android, but you can't do that with this phone. First, you can't uninstall the Google apps, you can only disable them. But if you disable them, then some features on the phone won't work. For instance, I disabled Google Photos but then I couldn't view any of my pictures or set wallpapers, so I was forced to reinstall it. Just something to note for other people out there who rebuke Google products. I was able to replace something though, like I was able to disable Google Drive so I could use Proton Drive. The built-in IR remote app doesn't work with anything I've tried, so I think that app just doesn't work.But overall, this phone is a fun tiny powerful novelty phone that I got for no other reason than being the tiniest I could find without sacrificing the features of my Z Fold5. My boyfriend laughs at it. Never heard of Unihertz but you've won a new customer. As long as the quality keeps up through the years, I will definitely stick with this brand (Samsung lost me as a customer with their latest phone release). And this is coming from a diehard Samsung fan since the first Samsung smartphone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jose Vazquez', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es un teléfono que cumple con las expectativas, excelente!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jeon', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on October 28, 2023', 'Review Body': '1.

Verdammt klein!Ich benutze das Jelly Star jetzt seit 10 Tagen. Gedacht war es als Zweithandy.Allerdings ""vergammelt"" mein Erstgerät auf der Fernseh-Kommode.Design:Klein und handlich, aber ziemlich dick.Stört aber nicht wirklich, egal in welcher Tasche. Und ja, es passt in jede Tasche!!!Außen:Durch das Kunststoffgehäuse ist es sehr rutschig. Also immer aufpassen, wo man es ablegt.Die LED auf der Rückseite kann man zum Glück dimmen oder komplett deaktivieren. Die werden verdammt hell!Das mitgelieferte Silikon -Case passt perfekt und schützt sogar das Display, wenn man es verkehrt herum ablegt.Die aufgebrachte Displayschutzfolie ist sehr anfällig gegen Kratzer, aber es ist eine zweite in der Packung.Ungewöhnlich sind der seitliche Ladeanschluss und die Position der Lautstärkewippe im Vergleich zu anderen Android-Geräten.Display:Mit 3"" sehr klein aber gestochen scharf und auch in praller Sonne noch hell genug.Die Farben wirken etwas blass aber nicht grottenschlecht, wie ich es schon bei einigen anderen gesehen habe. Beim Tippen und anderen Gesten gibt es keine Probleme. Nur am äußersten Rand reagiert das Display manchmal nicht sofort.Lautsprecher:Das Jelly Star hat einen Mono Lautsprecher an der Unterseite. Er wird recht laut und klirrt nur bei voller Lautstärke. Trotz der kleinen Bauform kann man fast schon von ordentlichem Bass reden.Kamera:Sie macht Bilder. Der Auto-Focus ist nicht der schnellste und in Dunkelheit werden die Bilder nix. Das können andere in dem Preissegment auch nicht wirklich besser. Bei Tageslicht macht die 48MP Knipse ordentliche Bilder.Die Selfie Cam überrascht mich da mehr. Die Gesichts-Entsperrung funktioniert sogar in relativ dunkler Umgebung tadellos und die Bilder sind vollkommen ok.Leistung:Wow!!! Das Teil rennt wie die Sau.Im Jelly werkelt der Mediathek G99 mit 8GB Arbeitsspeicher und den kann man noch auf 15GB erweitern mit dem RAM-Boost.Die 7GB gehen dann zwar als Speicher verloren, aber bei 256GB internem Speicher tut das keinem weg. Außerdem kann der Speicher noch per SD Karte erweitert werden. Meine 512GB Karte wurde problemlos erkannt.Akku:Nur 2000mAh klein aber was hat der schon zu arbeiten?Ich komme locker über einen Tag. Nach einem regulären Arbeitstag komme ich mit 55%-60% Ladestand nach Hause.2 Stunden Video-Wiedergabe mit voller Helligkeit und Start bei 70% Akkustand ließen den Akku auf 10% fallen.Beim anschließenden Ladetest bei 10% angefangen, bin ich auf folgende Werte gekommen.Nach 10min : 31%,nach 20min : 54%,nach 30min : 72%,nach 40min : 84%,nach 50min : 92%.Und vollständig geladen war es nach 58 Minuten.Ich finde, das ist ganz ordentlich.Allerdings stammen diese Werte nicht von dem Original-Ladegerät. Das hat nämlich nur 7,5W. Ich habe ein 25W Ladegerät benutzt.Bedienung:Die Größe ist das Hauptargument zum Kauf eines solchen Gerätes. Doch hier stößt man schnell an gewisse Grenzen.Mir war es nicht möglich, mit Gboard vernünftig zu tippen. Zum Glück gibt es einige Apps, die einem da zu Hilfe eilen. Ich verwende Tappy, ist zwar nicht kostenlos, aber die beste T9 Tastatur, die ich finden konnte.Auch die Schriftgröße bedarf einiger Umstellung. Wer schlecht sieht, ist hier fehl am Platz. Es ist halt alles klein.Im Vergleich zum Vorgänger, Jelly 2E wurde hier sehr viel verbessert.Der Fingerabdrucksensor reagiert jetzt rasend schnell, die Kamera wurde merklich verbessert, die Performance ist ein Quantensprung und dank NFC ist Bezahlen mit dem Handy auch noch drin.Für wen baut man sowas?Ich habe schon viele Geräte ausprobiert um Digital Detox zu betreiben und bin bei mehreren KAIOS Geräten gelandet. Was soll ich sagen?Der Detox hat geklappt, aber man war schon sehr stark eingeschränkt.Wer also einen Digital Detox auf Premium Niveau machen möchte, ist hier richtig. Das Jelly Star kann alles, was ein ""normales"" Smartphone kann.Aber halt kleiner, aber auf keinen Fall langsamer.Für alle, die ein kleines Gerät suchen, ohne große Abstriche machen zu müssen.Fazit:Für mich definitiv eine Kaufempfehlung!!\nRead more'}]",,B0CCJ6TH74,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CCJ6TH74,4g

My requirements were:- 3.5mm jack (and good DAC chip)- Camera without pixel binning capable of shooting RAW- Good battery for a full day of useI was unpleasantly surprised how limited my choices where. After some consideration I decided to splurge and pre-ordered Sony Pro-I and I am so happy about my choice!Audio is great, I really like how my IEMs sound with this phone.Photo experience is good. I spent some time adjusting to Sony's interface (Nikon user here), but this is somewhat expected. Two step shutter button is really nice and overall, workflow is very similar to any DSLR. Active area of the sensor is less than 1 inch and smartphone lenses are obviously far behind any modern prime lens, but it is enough for a 4K monitor or medium size photo print.One thing I was really surprised is how easy is to work with Lightroom on Android. For me transition from and to desktop versions of Lightroom is smooth and painless.Fingerprint sensor (which is also on/off button) requires some accurate finger positioning, but after some time it feels natural and works well.This is definitely not the phone for everyone. But if you are looking for a smartphone with great audio and camera for situations, when backpack with DSLR is not with you then I can recommend this device for consideration.P. S. there are lot of arguments there saying that separate camera is cheaper than this phone. Well, if you need just camera, and can carry audio player, camera and phone then yes. If you have a backpack carrier with 2 year old or for some other reason don't carry Photo backpack 24/7 I would say no.Pro-I is definitely not a point and shoot camera. It is much closer to DSLR experience where you need to post-process RAW files in Lightroom or similar software. Majority of phones out there do post-processing automatically and that's why out of the box many of them look more appealing. With Pro-I you have more freedom of edit, at the expense of effort.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Maulrus', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Sony Killed my Screen.

High spec hardware that works great, in a beautiful, slickly designed package. The Oneplus 11 will hang with any of the current gen Samsungs or Pixel Pro in just about any way. The camera performance may not test quite as highly as a current Galaxy S Ultra or Pixel Pro, but the cameras are very good and very close! Beautiful screen, blazing fast performance, 16gb RAM, and all the 5G and LTE bands you need for any US carrier, so what's not to like?I've found the battery life to be very good, as I still have at least 50% left when I get home from work. And as for charging, WOW, this thing charges ridiculously fast with the included charger - faster than just about anything else out there, and most phones don't even come with a charger anymore. Igo from 40-50% to full in almost no time. I did turn off the Wise charging feature though because I couldn't figure out how to set it up, and its mystery schedule didn't jibe with my super early wake up time.The lack of wireless charging seems unthinkable for an otherwise incredible flagship-level phone in 2023, and I have no idea why they omitted it. This is unforgivable, although I will say that with the battery life and super fast charging I can get by without wireless. This need not be a deal breaker even if you must have it, since wireless adaptors are all over Amazon for like $12.I have found some negative aspects of this phone, albeit minor ones I can live with. For one, the phone is beautifully designed but very slippery in the hand. You're going to protect your investment with a case anyway though, aren't you? I found a nice clear TPU one that shows it off will protecting it a bit and adding enough grip to make me comfortable. And I do wish the screen was flat rather than curved. I see no benefit to the curved edges, which can cause glare at some angles and lighting conditions, and they make screen protectors and cases a little difficult to engineer perfectly.The fingerprint sensor is my only other gripe. It works, but I have yet to find an under-screen sensor, whether ultrasonic or optical, that works as reliably and quickly as I'd like. Moto nails it with their side-mounted sensor on the power button of some recent phones, and I loved what LG did when the had it in the center of the BACK of their phones. My glass screen protector is probably partially to blame, but the sensor wasn't perfect with the factory-applied TPU cover, either. This has prompted me to finally try face unlock, which Oneplus has done a good job with, admittedly.All in all, I love this phone. It is probably the best Android device I've owned, surpassing even the LG V30 and Samsung s10 5G, which were my favorites in their respective heydays. The Oxygen OS interface isn't as intuitive as stock Android, and some people really don't like recent incarnations of it, but I don't have a problem with it. Full disclosure: the first thing I do with any Android device is install Nova launcher and the same basic setup I've been using for several years, so manufacturers' launchers are irrelevant to me, but Oxygen OS is fine with me otherwise and Oneplus bloatware is minimal.6/5 stars, GREAT phone with very competitive pricing for what you get.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lakay', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'its good for what i wanted especially  camera, and battery life.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I was convinced to buy this phone after seeing the photos  my daughter got with hers.what i dont like is no SD card  for extra storage.256GB is OK  BUT migrating from a well used established phone with its files doesnt leave me a lot for the photos i will be generating with this.it appears the phone DOES come with a screen protector  on it. i didn't realize that and installed a second party screen protector, which caused a lot of issues which was quite frustrating, for instance  the phone was near impossible to catch a phone call as the screen was not awakened on a incoming call.  the touch sensitivity was not responsive and always misspelling and changing  my typing, I spent a lot of time correcting the spelling of my work.... again extremely frustrating.  after i observed the dirt that had collected under the protector, i decided to change it. and then is when i observed that there seemed to be a second one  i did not know existed. ......... soooo......after installing a new protector all these issues went away. it has caused me to retract all the bad things i had murmured about this fine cellphone/camera  with a poor interface.I still wish it had Micro SD capability a TB of extra memory, that would make me contented to a high level.when i initially set it up and transferred the old phone to new, i was surprised at the speed of which all the data i wanted was moved.  photos, videos, all other documents. However it lacked the bookmarks of my preferred browser.i like the way it manages the battery usage, notifies me when an app is using too much and sends me to the settings to tweek its permission and usage the phone / system Shuts down apps that have not been used in a few months and removing permissions. I am not sure if it is the new version of android but, it is keeping things  controlled instead of snowballing into a big mess that is hard to resolve later and running the devise into  high inefficiency.as for charging it is  screaming  fast. it has a setting that will take its time also  I believe it is good to avoid  baking the battery every time  you charge. and there are several times i have gone 2 days of use before running the battery low.as for the camera. i love the interface and the optical quality for a cell phone is astounding. even zoomed in the pictures maintain a fair level of quality. as opposed to my past phones that would zoom  but produced images that resembled impressionist paintings.  the portraits of people  and snapshots of random things always please. I cannot wait till the northern lights are visible here in the Alaskan skies.I will however retain my dslr equipment for  the money shots....I caught this on sale for $699 which is the most i have paid for a cell phone  ever.I love the freedom I have from the control of the famous fruit company phone, and the huge cost they sell their new model for... ouchfor me it was a big step up from the Blu phones, which I last bought the  F91 5G is no slouch  the camera couldnt do well in low light, but to its advantage it was fast,  and i have a 512GB Mico SD  on top of the 256 internal.  at $199 (Sale price )  but the camera sucked. so i GEEKED out and use both  cell phones for different uses.Thats all I can say for now.all the best to you and good luck\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fahad', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on November 5, 2023', 'Review Body': ""This is a great phone overall.

I decided that a UMIDIGI would be a good, budget phone for her and so far she has been happy with her new phone.The UMIDIGI A15 is an attractive and well-built phone. I got the Pearl White which looks very nice and feels great in your hand. It looks like a flagship phone but at a price that won\'t destroy your wallet.It comes with 8GB of RAM and 256 GB internal storage. It also has a basic skin of stock Android 13 with no bloatware.The screen size is 6.7"" and it is slightly narrow, but this allows for a better grip and ease of operating one-handed.In the box, you get with the phone a USB-C to USB-C Charging cable and a 20Watt brick. Again, something that flagship companies have stopped supplying with their phones.There is also a semi-transparent case provided and the UMIDIGI A15 has a screen protector already installed. For a ""budget"" phone, the extras really add to the overall value.I had no problem transferring all the apps and other information from my wife\'s old phone to the UMIDIGI using the USB-C cable. Google makes the process very easy.The phone comes unlocked, so it should work with most cell phone providers. Our service provider is Mint Mobile (which uses T-Mobile towers) and the UMIDIGI A15 worked as soon as the SIM card was installed. I should point out that this phone doesn\'t use 5G, only 4G. However, this has not been a problem as 5G really isn\'t as predominate yet, while 4G is. We made a long trip recently through rural and urban areas and the phone worked everywhere we went.To top it off, it has a 5000mah battery and have yet to run out of power by the end of the day.The cameras work really well, and includes a wide angle and a macro lens. It also has night vision, which is surprising considering the price of the phone. Photos look nice and I have no complaints.My only complaint is the finger print detector which is located on the right-side power button. I find it awkward to use and prefer it to be on the back of the phone. However, most phones anymore are placing it on the front screen, so at least locating on the right side is more favorable for accessing it with either hand. It also comes with facial recognition which works fast and efficiently every time.There is also a ""quick access"" on the left side which you can program to quickly get to a favorite app, camera, flashlight, etc. That comes in very handy.Overall the UMIDIGI A15 is a great phone at a great price. If you don\'t want to pay $1000 dollars for a flagship phone, but still want a quality phone that is fast, responsive and full of useful features, the UMIDIGI A15 is certainly the phone to get.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Paulie Good Girl', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Happy with Purchase', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Normally I don't review products, but It has been a month going on to two months with my Umidigi phone.

(STILL!)', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020', 'Review Body': 'EDIT AUGUST 24, 2022: two years later and this phone is still going strong! Even when I use the phone throughout the day, it only needs to be charged every 24 hours. My phone case has kept it protected, it still looks brand new. Still runs like new. Even though this phone is ""renewed"" I\'ve never had an issue that required it to be troubleshooted or repaired. If I ever replace the phone, I\'m buying it renewed!Original review 2020:This is a product review, but first I wanna discuss my satisfaction with the fact that this is a renewed item.The phone arrived in a neat little box with generic brand charge cable and adapter, neither of these items are suited for the fast-charging capabilities of the phone, but I bought this item for the phone, so I\'m not gonna knock them on a cord and adapter. The phone looked brand new, no scratches or damage of any kind, not even so much as a fingerprint on it.The phone powered up just fine and I was able to get it setup without a hitch, as far as I\'m concerned they did an excellent job with the renewal, there\'s no way I can tell that it was even renewed except for the generic box, cable and charger. BTW, this product does not come with earbuds or anything, you only get the phone, the generic cord and generic adapter. Overall, I\'m happy buying this renewed, saved myself 50% of the brand new price.As for reviewing the phone itself, this is my first Samsung phone, I\'ve never so much as seen a Galaxy Note with my own eyes, and therefore I\'m still learning things about it. But I can say I love the stereo speakers, it\'s great when playing music or gaming, the sound has a nice punch to it, better than any phone speakers I\'ve ever heard. I was worried I wouldn\'t get used to the lack of a headphone jack, but I don\'t actually need it, I bought myself a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I can\'t think of any other reason I would need the headphone jack.The screen is really nice, it\'s amazing how the fingerprint scanner is INSIDE the screen, makes for unlocking the phone quite easy and free of having to hold the phone awkwardly like with other phones. The hole punch for the camera in the screen is much less distracting than I thought it would be, and in the end, I hardly notice it. Since the fingerprint scanner is located inside the screen, you can\'t just get a traditional otterbox case for this phone, the heavy duty screen protector doesn\'t allow fingerprint scanning, so you have to buy a specific stick-on screen protector. As for the phone case, I bought myself a ArmadilloTek case, and I love it...I like having all the extra storage on the phone, in the past I always felt like my phone filled up with stuff too quickly. Also all my previous phones were prone to becoming slow after filling it up with apps, photos and music, but this phone...I\'ve given it everything I have, only used up like 75 gigs, and have plenty more space, as well as the fast chip set in the phone makes the phone lightning fast.As for battery life, it lasts a long time! If you\'re just texting, listening to music, or periodically surfing the web, this phone lasts approximately 40-48 hours on a single charge.  If you\'re playing games and other power-consuming things, I believe this phone might get you through a pretty rigorous 24 hours.This phone came pre-loaded with a few useless apps, but didn\'t come pre-loaded with all the other useful apps that generally come on androids like a music player, Amazon, and other such...loaded it myself. I ended up loading Samsung Music...which I already love way more than iTunes or Apple Music.I\'m still learning how to use the stylus pen, believe me, there is a TON of ways to use the pen, but from what I\'ve tried so far, it\'s great! I especially like being able to hand-write notes and convert them to text. I wish I could say more about the phone, but again, I\'m still learning. Overall, I\'m happy with this purchase, it was well worth the money, I highly recommend it!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alvin Holladar', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Got it in mint condition!

The box contains the phone, Samsung charger, and pen. The phone was in prestine condition. No scratches and no dents. Since my older phone was a Samsung, I was able to use Smart Switch app to tranfer all my files and apps to the note. I took the cricket sim card from the older phone and inserted it to the note. As far as calls and texts, the phone works perfectly. The pen works also. What i have noticed, that with wire and wireless charging, the phone heat up. The fingerprint sensor is located on the front of the phone. It does what it suppose to do. I would have to get back with you about the battery and beleive me I will.  Looking at what I need from a phone in today digital world, this phone suits my needs. I could not afford this phone when it first came out. I had a Samsung 8 and was happy with it. It got damaged. Once again, do to lack of funds, l brought an A11. That phone was less than 200 and it let me know that. You pay for what you get. Samsung charges up to a 75 to 100 dollars for a note 10 renewed phone. So the money value is worth it. I have 90 days to critique this phone. If anything goes wrong, I will be back.Part 2, April 23, I have had the phone for two months. I had a problem with the sound quality. That turned out to be an app that I put on the phone. Do not put any sound enhanced app on this phone. There is no need for it. When this first happen, I contacted the seller with an email. As of today, I have not received any response from them. After contacting Samsung, the issue was resolved. As far as the amount of time your phone last on a charge depends on several factors. How much time you use your phone during the day. What are you using to charge the phone with. Base on my usage, a full charge will last a day. The fastest way is with a Samsung plug in the wall. It works faster than what came  in the package with this phone. I also have two anker wireless chargers. One is a stand. The other is a flat round one. The stand is good for overnight charging cause it the slower of the two.  The quickest way is to power down the phone and plug it into the wall with a 15w to 25w Samsung charger. 30 to 45 minutes, depending on battery level at the time you plug it  For you video needs. This phone has a 60hz refresh rate. The rate can't be changed like on the Note 10+. Also the screen is 1080p only. I haven't played with the camera yet. I will give it an eight for visual quality. They should have done at least HD. The 8 had HD and 4k video recording on it. For right now it serves my phone needs. I been wanting one for the last two years. I feel that this phone fulfill the basic digital features for a person today. Especially with the application of S pen capabilities.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Maria M.

Ich hatte es schon einmal interessant gefunden aber nicht gekauft, weil ich damals noch kabelgebundene Kopfhörer hatte und dieses Handy keinen Klinkenanschluss hat.Ich bin insgesamt zufrieden mit diesem Handy. Es hat ein paar Eigenheiten. Z. B. hat es eine vorinstallierte Radio App, die man weder deinstallieren noch deaktivieren kann. Da es aber keinen Klinkenanschluss gibt, kann man logischerweise keine kabelgebundenen Kopfhörer anschließen, um die Radio App zu nutzen. ^^Auch suspekt finde ich, dass das Handy einen krass lauten Lautsprecher aber keine vorinstallierte App zum Abspielen von Musik hat.Den linken Knopf finde ich cool. Man kann ihn selbst programmieren. Man kann ihn einmal kurz drücken, gedrückt halten und zweimal kurz drücken. Und für alle drei Optionen kann man eigene Funktionen verknüpfen. Entweder öffnet man damit eine App oder schaltet die Taschenlampe ein oder macht einen Screenshot. Das ist recht praktisch.Die Kamera ist ziemlicher Käse. Aber da das in meinem Fall ein Ersatzhandy ist, spielt das für mich keine Rolle. Wenn man ein Handy sucht um unterwegs schöne Fotos zu machen, ist dieses Handy die falsche Wahl.Das Handy ist echt groß. Ich habe sehr große Hände (Handschuhgröße 11/12) und es ist genauso groß, wie meine Handfläche. Und ziemlich schwer. Für kleine Hände und/oder Jogginghosen ist das also nichts.Vermutlich der Grund für das Gewicht: Der Akku hält echt lang. Ich bekam es mit 80% geladenem Akku und musste es erst nach 3 Tagen mit 15 % aufladen.Die Übersetzung ist an manchen Stellen nicht ganz perfekt. In den Kamera-Einstellungen steht z. B. Unter der Spiegeln Option: ""Nur funktioniert mit Front Kamera."" :DIch gebe 4 Sterne. Warum? (Natürlich subjektiv)Positiv:Mir gefällt das Gewicht irgendwie. Ich nutze es auf lange Sicht sowieso nur daheim.Der Akku hält echt lang.Programmierbare Taste.Lautsprecher kann sehr laut gestellt werden.Speicherplatz ist völlig ausreichend für eigene Apps.Wirkt durch das stabile Gehäuse sehr robust.Neutral:Kamera ist schlecht. In meinem Fall egal.Kein Klinkenanschluss. In meinem Fall egal.Unhandlich.

While the phone works for calling/texting it\'s truly not unlocked for all carriers. I could not use the Google pay featire because of the bootloader being unlocked and the IMEI will not let me switch carriers. I messaged the seller about this and they said they would process and expedited exchange. I sent the phone back but once they got the phone back the seller messaged me that they don\'t have any inventory to send me a new phone so they just refunded me. I go into their Amazon posting and it says they have 6 in stock today.....SHADY. Now I\'m stuck without a phone longer. While I appreciate the quick refund I would not trust them with future things.

Camera has a small black hole in the front screen and I honestly never notice it anymore. Best of all, if you buy a unlocked version (be careful, carrier unlock is NOT the same as bootloader unlocked)... If you want to use a custom rom, you will need BOTH unlocked. Luckily the phones are abundant and they are still cheap. My custom rom gives me TEN YEARS of OS updates, security, features. That alone makes it very desirable. It's light, thin and fast. I like CPU intensive games and it handles them like a champ. Screen is bright, colors are vibrant with lots of options. Sound it really good. The Pixel 6a does NOT have an SD expansion tray. They want you to use their cloud, because of course they do! So get the biggest memory you can. Also the 6a has 99% of the bugs fixed. So allot of older reviews are not accurate anymore.

Coming from a Galaxy S20 FE to a Galaxy S21 Plus was worth it, even if I losses the ability to put in a Micro CD card slot.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ChipDesigner', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Smooth Performance, Sharp Photography', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The Samsung S21+ in Phantom Black has lived up to the hype and then some.

It felt sturdier than the old Galaxy S10 it is replacing.  Big points on unboxing for finding a  USB-C Cable, charger and a silicone case were included.  Thanks to UMIDIGI for including these and not following the big companies in not including a charger with their phones.The phone did not require charging as it was already at 100% when I plugged it in.  Setup was straightforward and fast.  I connected the two phones with my USB-C to USB-C cable from my old phone and went through the setup process.  Everything was transferred seamlessly and all apps installed without issue.  All contacts, text messages and emails were there.Performance wise the phone is pretty smooth.  Swiping between screens is seamless, watched some YouTube videos and played some basic games like Candy Crush and Crossy Road.  I am not a major gamer so I'm not too worried about high-end gaming performance.Screen resolution is a bit on the low side, but the image is bright and everything looks good.  I was a little disappointed that the image does not entirely fill the whole screen, but it's not a deal breaker for me.Battery is huge and after the setup and transfer of the data from the old phone, watching YouTube for 15 minutes, playing a few rounds of Candy Crush and just checking out the camera and taking some video the phone was still at 97%.  Only downside was the lack of a fast charging feature, but it is unrealistic to expect this of a budget phone.Camera is decent, takes good shots and decent video.  However, the camera app included requires access to your phone and location must be turned on.  I did not want to enable these options so I downloaded the open camera and used that.  It worked fine.  I suggest these requirements be removed or made optional as a camera should not require access to your phone and location.Overall, I was impressed with this phone.  It is my first UMIDIGI and I will consider it again in the future.  If you are looking for a good budget phone then add this to your list of candidates.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gianni Mauro', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on January 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Un gran bel dispositivo.Confezione.Arriva in una scatola di cartoncino spesso.Il telefono é carico, nel mio caso, ad oltre il 95%.Come da norme vigenti non troverete l'alimentatore ma il cavo (ben fatto).Molto apprezzata la custodia trasparente in dotazione, decisamente ben fatta.Estetica.Visto da dietro (quindi con le telecamere a vista) viene scambiato per un ben piú costoso iPhone.Il materiale (alluminio anodizzato presumo) é di ottima qualitá.Lo schermo lo reputo di fascia medio alta, molto luminoso e con testi ed immagini ben definiti.Caratteristiche tecniche.I dati dichiarati sono confermati: la reattivitá é ottima, superiore a prodotti di prezzo maggiore.Peso e dimensioni sono nella norma per un telefono con uno schermo di queste dimensioni.La sezione audio, analizzando un telefono e non di un sistema hi fi, é di buon livello.La batteria si carica rapidamente ed ha un'autonomia da due giorni ad oltre una settimana (dipende dell'utilizzo).Giudizio finale.Prodotto molto valido ad un ottimo prezzo.Sono curioso di vedere fino a quando riceverá gli aggiornamenti Android.CONSIGLIATISSIMO.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Miguel Gracia', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on January 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Esta excelente el producto\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'PeterToegel', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on December 23, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Das UMIDIGI G5 MP27 stellt ein aus meiner Sicht ganz hervorragendes Smartphone dar.Das pure Android 13 Betriebssystem kommt dankenswerterweise ohne Bloadware oder sonstige Gängelsoftware daher, zumindest für mich ein wichtiger Kaufgrund.Das Gerät ist außerordentlich flott in der Bedienung, niemals hängt eine Anwendung oder benötigt messbare Zeit nach dem Aufruf.

Pressed for time and options, I landed on the Umidigi G3 Plus. I’m very glad I did. At roughly $120, the G3 Plus is an excellent value for the money, and dare I say enough phone for most people.Unboxing ImpressionsThe UMIDIGI G3 is made out of a hard plastic with a subtle leather pattern on the back. I found the included TPU case to be nice and grippy. Speaking of accessories, the G3 comes with a 5W charger and cable, a SIM removal tool, and a pre-installed screen protector. As everyone knows, Apple, Samsung, or Google don’t go in for creature comforts like these nowadays. The fact that UMIDIGI did at this price point is nothing short of amazing.Hardware FeaturesLet’s be honest – the UMIDIGI G3 is a substantial phone. The screen is a massive 6.52’’ IPS HD+ affair. It caps out at 720 x 1600 pixels with an immersive 20:9 aspect ratio. It isn’t the brightest, but I found it to be visible enough in direct sunlight with good viewing angles. Up top is the endangered 3.5mm jack, which plays nicely with low impedance IEM’s. There is a single down firing speaker on the base of the phone, next to a USB-C port with USB 2.0 speeds that provides 10W charging. On the right are the traditional volume buttons and a power button which doubles as a fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader, I’m happy to say, is splendidly fast and accurate. Seriously. It’s my favorite part of the phone.Daily UseIn day to day use, this phone shines. Many of the services we take for granted in the US, from Google’s suite of apps to T-Mobile’s VoLTE protocol work perfectly. In my testing, Netflix, Prime, and Criterion all played in full HD and looked good doing it. The phone is free of bloatware, and applications can be easily changed to suit your fancy. I found that the G3’s Unisoc T606 breezed through emails, web searches, and a quick game of Minecraft. While there are certainly faster chips out there, the T606 struck me as surprisingly capable. The only thing this phone doesn’t have is NFC or wireless charging, though I confess that I haven’t missed it very much at all.CamerasThe cameras are about what you’d expect for a phone of this caliber. The main camera system consists of a 16 megapixel camera which is reinforced by a 2 megapixel camera for depth detection. The portrait mode works well enough, even with curly hair, though it can be a bit aggressive. The camera app also features a fairly comprehensive Pro mode, which gives you access to a host of manual settings. On the face of the G3, you’ll find a single droplet style camera which easily bests the upper-tier laptop camera of my M2 MacBook Pro. If the camera is important to you, the UMIDIGI G3 Max might be your best bet at just $10 more.Conclusion and Final ThoughtsIt must be said – the UMIDIGI G3 Plus seriously impressed me. If you need an inexpensive phone for whatever reason, this is a great choice. Here are a couple of quick thoughts that I couldn't jam elsewhere in the review:- The G3 has the ability to use 4GB of the ROM as swap for the memory. I didn't really notice a difference in performance, but it's nice to have it as an option.- WiFi, cellular, and Bluetooth (tested with my Qudelix 5k) worked well.- Umidigi seems to have built their own updater which lives in the About Phone section in the Android settings.- I scratched the screen protector fairly quickly, so be careful with keys in your pocket.TL,DRPros:Unbelievable price to performance ratioStock Android 13 with no bloatwareGood enough cameraFast fingerprint readerCons:No NFC or wireless chargingThe G3 Max offers a better screen and camera for just $10 more\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Joseph Yarka', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great budget phone!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023', 'Review Body': 'I used this phone for a few days and while it’s it the highest of quality.  For a spare phone, a phone for your parents who aren’t used to technology, or even a kids first phone this will work for you.  The phone is reasonably responsive I didn’t feel like it was stuttering while using it.  Now while this it not a phone worth 1k or more there are a lot of things going for it. The battery is huge and lasts for days on end as a simple user for messages, web browsing, etc.  now I would not recommend this to the heavy user for gaming and other things.  But for what you’re paying this phone is a good grab. I’d highly recommend this phone for the quality and price you are paying plus you even get a screen protector and a case included and installed. No having to fuss over going out to purchase those right away or raven worrying if the screen protector will go on correctly. This phone is a must if you just need something cheap and reasonable for you to use daily for a little while.  I’m not sure how the support would go for this over time but already having android 13is great with the new customization options and full features from android it’s a great grab for someone not looking to break the bank. While this phone doesn’t compete with high end models you are getting a way bigger battery for the phone and pretty much the same software features if you’re looking for a phone to play the newest games or take the best pictures I’d say this isn’t for you and spend more money on a different phone but if you need a phone just for daily use calling text and the basics this could be the one for a small price.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'borogroves', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Plain vanilla, but it works', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This is a large-ish, simple phone that does little other than make phone calls and show maps and directions.

Not too smooth, so better grip.After turning on the phone, setup was not as easy as it could have been.  Data transfer from the old phone is proposed by 2 ways, wired or wireless.  Both ways failed.  A third party app had to be used.It was not a big problem, but people who are les Tech inclined might find it irritating.Remember that it is a relatively inexpensive phone and should not be compared to expensive top tier phones.  Keeping that in mind, for the price, the specs are excellent.  The phone never lags, never freezes.  Sound quality is better than ok.The screen is crisp and bright, and works great.Battery life is excellent, but I don't know how it will be in the long run.The buttons are easy to press and respond well.The finger print reader works well, but takes a little bit of getting used to, since the reader is small.Having many normal apps open does not slow the phone down, response time stays great.For most people, for most uses, the phone will perform well.Call quality is normal, but the antenna could be stronger.My old Samsung Galaxy S8 has a stronger signal, and more bars at the same place inside or outside of the house.  I have had a Bison ( 1st gen ), A7 pro, and A13 Pro and the same can be said for the G3 and these phones signal strength wise.

We get about 3 days in this phoneI\'ll put in a couple tips after the review.The good:Screen is bright, no lag with videos or basic games, the speaker is loud, the speaker is on the base of the phone and not behind it (unlike the 13).Auto detected the SIM card and loaded T-Mobile LTE settings, no issues with a 256 GB micro SD..Here\'s a biggie that I like, NO BLOAT ADDED !!! It has just the Ulefone apps and just the basic Google apps only, headphone jack is on top of the phone and not the bottom.No forced Google ""At A Glance"" widget that could not be removed from the desktop.Can rename apps and change app icons, we use that to change the name of our bank app and icon so it appears as any other solitaire game.The bad:The photo camera light is weak compared to the multi lights of the Power Armor 13, could use a small row of LEDs for photos and video without having to turn on the camping light and blinding everyone taking a photo in low lighting conditions.The connector port needs a gasket cover, pins can get corrosion (Armor 13 started getting corrosion after a year).The launcher is too basic, needs the features of Nova to hide apps, cannot change the home screen, home is always the first left screen. scalable icons would be nice.The font has issues, too big font and the app names will get cut off and crunched together.Lack of updates, after having the Powe Armor a few months it updated from Android 10 to Android 11, with either version of Android, the device never got any security updates.Unknown variables:Power Armor 13 had issues with some of Google\'s native accessibility software and crashed the fingerprint reader, phone would start saying ""fingerprint reader not installed"" and had to do a factory reset. Hopefully Ulefone and Google fixed that with Android 13.Power Armor 13 after time, the home screen would randomly jump to another screen and there was no way to manually set it back.Will update review if this becomes an issue.A nitpick:Live wallpapers do not work with the lock screen, when using a live wallpaper even if you change the static lock screen wallpaper it will revert back to the default wallpaper for the lock screen.Camera punch hole is big, not as bad as the 13. Camera could have been placed up in the bezel area and that would have given an unobstructed ""Infinity screen"" like Xiaomi had for the Mix series.Tips:Amazon doesn\'t sell OEM chargers or OEM cables for this phone however there is a workaround and Amazon does sell some.To get ""super fast charging"" you need a 6 amp 11 volt 66 watt PD charger and cable.I searched ""6a 66w PD charger"" and got ones that use USB A ports and ones USB C ports. They do have one for Australia and the EU for overseas travel.I also earched ""6a 66w PD cable"" and the USB A to USB C cables are up to 10 feet, other sites even longer and 6.6 foot USB C to USB C cables that supports reverse charging.Anything under 6 amp, the phone will charge at regular speed and will take a couple of days to charge so it MUST use a 6 amp 66 watt PD charger AND 6 amp 66 watt PD cable to get ""flash charging"".OEM chargers and OEM cables are available from other websites but take time to arrive.If you drop things a lot, I would recommend putting the phone inside a TPU gel case, there are a couple of weak areas, we had a Blackview drop on the corner on linoleum and it damaged the digitizer.If you\'re not a fan of the launcher, try Nova or Microsoft Launcher, both play nice with this phone.Will update review if any bugs in the future.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'From iphone 11 to the BRICK', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is a man's man's phone, 1.4 lbs, and girthy, and your going to build your grip and forearm strength.Women are impressed with the size, wink wink, of the phone, puts these frail pritzy drop once phones to shameSecond, all the tactical features, you can move in a pitch black room and see everything.Third, the battery this was the main selling point because now I feel free, iphone 11 made me a slave to the charging port, they should call this 24 Unchained, ha.

We have a solid phone here especially for the purpose functionality and the price.Disclaimer/Elephant in the room- If you search for a 22000mah battery in a phone and you think it's light... IT'S NOT. This phone will be heavy and harder to use with one hand. Quite possible but harder. But it's got JUICE.Pros:- exceptional battery life- they didn't lie about the 1000 lumens flash light as it is MUCH brighter than your regular phone's light- separate button for flashlight for easy access- decent fingerprint sensor with good coverage for each finger- seals for the USB C charging port and headphone jack- did I mention headphone jack?- separate action button aside from the separate flashlight button- decent speaker (only one speaker to my knowledge)- Solid plastic and metal coverings to the phone.- ip68 and ip69x water resistant (I will continue to put it in a waterproof case just to be safe)- good display! decent colors but you will get better with Samsung. Still surprised at how good the colors were.- 2 sim slots and micro SD storage up to 2? (I think?) terabytes.- decent bluetooth capability- decent processor with decent performance. Good for a phone this price for sure. (2.05 ghz by heliotech I believe)- overkill ram that you will never need 12gb- overkill VRAM that will be hard to even utilize most of it unless you play something like fortnite or some solid mobile game graphics wise. also 12 gb- night vision with some good sensors!- android 14!Cons:- Charging takes a long time (big battery makes sense)- Power button can feel a bit flimsy at times but works alright.- Thick boy. Heavier but that's obvious.- The charging seals require some decent and not super short nails to unlock (I would never have short nails what?)- Thick bezels! Lots of screen but anyone who doesn't like thick bezels might not be too happy.- Camera quality. Between decent and mediocre. The cameras are quite grainy unless you have some good lighting. And the resolution and quality fell a little below expectations. Still an okay camera though!- Mono speaker- HAPTICS/VIBRATION! THEY SUCK! Think of the vibration motor of a cheap and bleh phone. Same haptics for this one unfortunately. Want some good and satisfying vibrations? Poco X3 nfc, and Poco X6 Pro 5g have really solid ones. Not to mention they are some really good value phones.- Want a case for this phone? You can try..... I wish you good luck haha- No software equalizer (for audio people) 3rd party equalizers work though!- Meh launcher (not much bloatware though!)- Limited on features for the settings (decent customizability as any other android)- I WANT AN INVISIBLE BOTTOM BAR FOR MY GESTURES!!! (I think I am only one who cares about this.)- No default gallery application (get google gallery. Best bet for this phone.)- Personal issue with getting notifications- Interesting phone shape.....Overall: Solid phone choice! For those who want some specific things out of a specific phone!

I just got it today and so far is very good. I will be updating this review as I use it. So stay tuned.March 10, 2024It's been a few weeks since I got the Ulefone Armor 24. It has performed wonderfully, I've had it at low temperatures, and high temperatures without any problems. There is enough space for all of my applications, the ones from work and the personal ones. The camping light is fine and once in a while, I use it to check underneath the fifth wheel. The speaker on this phone is really good, is loud and I can hear it even in high noise places. Data transfer speeds are fine at 4G makes no difference, I used to have an iPhone 5G and makes no difference. I get a signal everywhere, I got a signal before with my old iPhone. However, the Tmobile network works the best in the US but you will still find places with no coverage and or poor coverage. I have 161 apps and performance is great without any of the added features to make it faster. The battery lasts up to 40 hours of continuous use except for the time that I am sleeping of course(I don't recharge the phone until is completely discharged). I like the fact that is roust, in the truck everything gets mistreated and so far this phone seems to take a lot of abuse.Disadvantages:1- Its robustness makes it a heavy phone, so don't put it in a weak holder and spect it to stay in it. The highways in several parts of North America are bad and they will not stay in the holder. I bought a thick and strong holder for a tablet and it works.2- It won't take wireless charging. It is fast charging and it takes about 2.5 hours to charge on a 66w charger that comes with. But don't plug it in a lower charger that it will take forever to charge.3- One thing that does happen is that when the phone is charging in the truck on my inverter when it reaches 80% the inverter turns off. I run a microwave in that inverter and never turns off. So I am not sure why that phone does it if it is the phone. I never run more than one item in the inverted at the same time.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Eduardo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'el producto es excelente, funciona muy bien, la batería le dura mucho, las funciones y aplicaciones todo excelente, sin problemas hasta el momento, el único detalle es el espesor del producto que es fuera de lo común, pero todo muy bien, estoy contento con mi compra.el producto llego rápido y en el tiempo establecido.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'SANON Bertin', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on August 14, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Un excellent produit pour mes voyages dans les pays où les coupures d'électricité sont récurrentes.

So I tried this product.  It has been a while since I used the android system anyway.  Set up was easy.  Used the cable.  All the apps worked (I don\'t use many, mostly auto locks, video and news media, etc.)  It set up with 5G Spectrum no problem but took about 45 minutes to fully operate.  I also had to restart three times to get a connection but don\'t know if it would have worked otherwise.  No big deal anyway.  This has a nice response, good screen, and acceptable performance.  Nice color and everything seems to work fine.  I like the ability to increase local memory with the scan cards.  Way cheaper than apple and you can take them out and plug into your local computer for very fast transfers and control.  Much faster than any other method for huge files.  The camera on this unit is fine.  Not State of the Art but hey this is not a pro camera anyway.  Want to do photos get the real thing.  This is just a nice machine for those daily snaps.  Seems we have gotten used to regular photos so this is OK.  One thing after having a small frame phone like the SE2022 this thing is huge.  It really doesn\'t fit anywhere.  And the screen use seems made more to get more on it than it does to make things larger and more readable.  The messages font seem to match the screen.  Very small or too large.  Just like the smaller phone.  The photos are nice, larger.  I bought this in ""acceptable"" condition, used saving about 260 from the list price.  It is worth it.  I would not want to spend list for it though.

I don’t feel my daughter is old enough/mature enough for a phone. But I believe everyone should have access to music. We tried a mp3 player but it was annoying to put music on. And a really good mp3 player is hundreds of dollars. This was a cheap option and has parental controls. Unfortunately she can turn them off, luckily I would be notified. Proved it to her so she knows. It’s working great so far with Apple Music family plan. When she’s home she can download and look for new songs. On her walk to school or youth programs or doing chores or whatever she can easily listen to music. Slight issue with paring her head phones but that was a headphones issue. So all in all. I recommend if other parents are like me and looking for a easy cheaper way to get their kids music.I did have to make her a google account and then go into parent controls and link it to mine via her phone and then mine. And then downloaded an app on my phone(iPhone) to remotely control. Once I figured that out it was easy.Only small issue was setting her time to the right time zone. It lagged so I spent an hour trying to fix it. And then finally gave up but a few hours later it was magically on the right time zone.Happy with the purchase I got her a screen protector and an otterbox that came in the recommended add ons. Everything fits. So I recommend those products too.Oh and the apps and internet and everything else works well too without a SIM card when hooked only to WiFi. She get 30-1hr a day to surf the web bc she likes googling things. Animals, geology, astronomy, toys, when her shows and movies are going to release, her favorite characters to phone back grounds.She says the camera works really good and she already has a million pictures of our dogs. Next step is printing some.She also researched about the phone it’s self and how to do things. Like we can put in her thump print and mine to access the phone. I guess next she’s gonna research my iPhone to help me lolHer storage is filling up fast so we will be coming to that bridge when soon. Personally I think she needs to delete some photos and videos she made of her tv shows lol. But we have a lot of cloud storage through apple but idk yet how compatible that will be. I’m sure she will research it.Good buy for a WiFi only option! I’m thinking about getting one to keep in my purse for planning rather than my big planner that takes up so much space. And for music so I can not be interrupted during workouts. Bc I miss those days when people knew I was going to be unreachable and understood patience and not everything is an emergency lol.

I bought a defective phone from you which was supposed to be a new phone but I can not use it. First, it would not charge for two days the first week I got. I tried all the chargers in the house, and it would not charge. The next morning, the battery finally died. I had planned to buy another phone but decided to try charging it again then it came on so I thought the problem was over. When I traveled, I did not use it for 6 days because there was no WIFI, so I  have barely used this phone that is now stuck with me.The next thing I experienced on Sunday was no connectivity. There was no reception almost all day on Sunday, and today, I am having the same issue.I tried to print out a return label on Sunday  as soon as I came home, but there was only one place on your website to drop it off. There was an option to choose my own drop off location, but each time I typed the locations in the space provided, it would not go through so I was stuck with your drop off location choice which was Georgia Tech, an hour away from me. On Monday morning, when I  went back online to  try again, the return space was closed. Why was the last day of return the 21st instead of the 22nd? Why would you set it up like you have only to have one location available and nothing else? Is it to make me get stuck with the phone? Well, you have succeeded. What if I lived in Augusta, Georgia, how was I supposed to drop it off at Georgia Tech?The reason why I bought this phone was because it was unlocked so I could use it when I traveled out of the country. My trip was from April 6 - 21. So I had little to no chance of returning this phone because you have only one drop off location on your site. Now, I am stuck with it and can not use it because it is defective, and I have to buy another phone. I hope you enjoy the money knowing you sold a junk phone to me.As I type, I am using my WIFI because the phone is not receiving any connections.

It\'s clear to me that they have defective units and should look to get them replaced under warranty, or they haven\'t optimized the settings to suite their usage. The unit I got is mind-blowing good. It\'s so good, in fact, that I don\'t understand how Moto doesn\'t knock Sammy off the podium.My battery is outstanding and nearly comparable to my ""Rugged"" phone which has a 6600 mah battery. The screen on the Edge \'21 is an absolute stunner. The 144hz rate has now spoiled me to all other phones. And the processing power is more than capable for anything I do with it. As far as fragility goes.... Well, that will very from person to person. It\'s obviously not a Cat phone or a Ulefone, so don\'t treat it like one. Fragility is a price we all pay if we want sleek and sexy slivers of glass as our phones. If we want that trend to change, than we have to buy more ""rugged"" phones.For anyone who isn\'t impressed with this phone, try to change a couple settings; You have to manually enable the 144hz refresh rate in the settings. Also, you have to enable ""Ram Boost"" which makes available Ram go from 8gb to 10gb. These are the 2 greatest features of this phone that many people may not know about.One last thing you should know. The phone ships out with Android 11, but is immediately ready for an update to Android 12. So in reality this is an Android 12 phone, but the description doesn\'t mention this fact. Just another cherry on top of the sundae. Overall, I couldn\'t be more impressed with this phone, and nothing out there can touch it with this price point. I paid $299 on Amazon, and I feel guilty, as if I somehow scammed the seller. There should be no possible way to get this much awesomeness at that price. My mind is blown!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Craig', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Near flagship performance without the price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2021', 'Review Body': 'I picked up the Edge 2021 to replace a Z4 and it\'s quite the upgrade. Lightning fast and a decent camera. It doesn\'t quite match up to a true flagship. But if you don\'t want to drop $1k on a phone, it\'s close enough. The Snapdragon 778 inside is competitive with last year\'s 865 flagship processor in many benchmarks. It drops last year\'s edge display, which by many accounts was somewhat annoying in actual use, so that may be a good thing. The blue back is prettier in person than in pictures.Pros: If you\'re a Motorola fan, all the familiar gestures are still here. The 6.8"" screen is huge. The three sensor camera is pretty high end at this price. The 144hz screen refresh rate is awesome, fast, smooth, and puts iPhones that all rock 60hz screens to shame. You get 8 gigs of operating ram and 256 for storage. You can add another 2 gigs of operating ram in the settings.  The huge 5000 mAh battery is awesome.Cons: downgrading from OLED to an LCD screen is lame (though to be fair, you\'ll be hard pressed to tell the difference). The lack of a headphone jack is annoying. The 144hz refresh rate is not on by default - the default is ""auto"", which maxes out at only 120hz. Contrary to what some reviews claim, this model doesn\'t have mmwave 5g connectivity. It does have sub 6 and C band 5g connectivity, which to be honest are the only ones most will ever connect to anyway. The back is plastic. It\'s a pretty, glossy, plastic that mimics glass, but it is kinda cheap at this price point. That 144hz screen refresh rate is sexy, but it eats battery quickly. Those 2 day battery life claims aren\'t happening with that setting. More like 1 day at best.Conclusion: if you\'re an Apple or Samsung fan, this phone isn\'t for you. It\'s for those who want something different than everyone else. It offers a lot for the money. It\'s an unlocked high-end midrange phone that approaches flagship performance for hundreds less. If that\'s good enough for you, then you\'ll love it. If you want the absolute best specs and camera, look elsewhere.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M_horrocks', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Life Saver', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My 2022 Moto G stylus died but I absolutely adored it.

Tenía la duda si al ser un equipo desbloqueado iba a funcionar con las redes de México, ya que decía ser diseño exclusivo para operar en EE.UU. sin embargo, les garantizo que funciona perfecto con AT&T y Telcel.Es un celular de gama alta a un excelente precio y si tú banco te lo permite, te brinda hasta meses sin intereses. Llegó mucho antes de lo esperando y muy bien empacado.El diseño es único, delgado, elegante y con un acabado y brillo sin duda espectacular, que de no ser porque hasta el momento no encuentro funda transparente para el mismo, me he visto en la necesidad de ponerle una funda negra de la marca Spigen que le queda de maravilla. Obvio si vas a invertir en un celular como este, invierte también en una funda de calidad para el mismo.Los 8 gigas de memoria ram hacen de este teléfono un un excelente equipo, se maneja muy fluido, las aplicaciones no se quedan pasmadas, reproduces vídeo en tiempo real, los retardos de carga de videos son casi inexistentes, en resumen una maravilla. Sus 256 gigas de memoria interna (no cuenta con ranura de expansión) nos brinda la suficiente capacidad de almacenamiento casi a la par con una laptop. Este equipo prácticamente podría ser considerado una tablet compacta por sus características particulares. La configuración y el personalizado de funciones y aplicaciones es bastante intuitivo. Su cámara de 108 mgpx nos permite tomar fotos precisas y con gran angular, también cuenta con varios efectos para la toma y retoque de la fotografía. La tasa de refresco de 144Hz de la pantalla, nos permite tener una excelente calidad de vídeo e imagen lo cual, para los gamers se agradece bastante ver todo el matiz de gráficos en alta calidad. La resolución de pantalla es FullHD+ de 2460 x 1080 pixeles. El procesador de esta belleza es un snapdragon 778G y la batería es de 5000mAh con carga rápida de 30 watts. La batería se carga de 0 a 100 en aproximadamente 40 a 45 minutos, proporcionando una carga de 0 a 50% en aproximadamente 20 minutos. La batería dura aproximadamente día y medio a dos si tiene un uso promedio de equipo celular, si lo ocupas para jugar e interactuar con redes sociales es posible que se vea decremento significativo en el desempeño de la misma. Por el uso de carga rápida el teléfono se calienta un poco durante la carga, por lo cual no es recomendable ni con este ni con ningún otro equipo, estarlo operando durante el tiempo de carga.La caja contiene, el celular, cable tipo C para carga, cargador rápido de 30W, herramienta para expulsión de bandeja de SIM card y manual de usuario rápido y garantía. No contiene auriculares, o te compras unos con entrada tipo C o te compras un adaptador si cuentas con audífonos de entrada 3.5.El único pero que le dejo a este equipo, de hecho son dos: uno, el altavoz del equipo deja mucho que desear al momento de querer escuchar música o conectarle los audífonos, no te ofrece una excelente calidad de sonido, creo que es lo que haría falta mejorar, el equipo a gritos pide dos bocinas con salida estéreo y lo segundo para mí, la parte trasera de color azul eléctrico y tan divino es el centro real de todas la huellas digitales habidas y por haber, se mancha hasta con sólo mirarlo, literal. Te la deberás pasar limpiandolo con una franela si como yo tienes manía por el brillo perfecto.En resumen, una excelente compra, estoy 100% satisfecha con mi compra y sin duda lo recomiendo.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rajesh Kannan', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Singapore on July 7, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Great price for this range\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'SAM', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Australia on August 5, 2022', 'Review Body': ""great phone with Samsung's 108 megapixel camera on very low price.works very fast.battrey life is very long.using from 4 months .5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'El Pol', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 4, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Esto va a parecer comercial pero es la verdad.Me lo pensé mucho para regresar a Android después de casi 10 años con Apple, pero los precios de iPhone ya son ridículos y las mejoras entre una versión y otra (de hardware y software) son prácticamente nulas . No me equivoqué. Este teléfono me costó poco menos de MXN$7,000 y estoy totalmente satisfecho.Funciona bien con telcel, viene desbloqueado y solo tuve que ponerle la sim card, e inmediatamente tuve servicio.La cámara del teléfono no es terrible, aunque no se compara con la calidad y respuesta de la cámara de iPhone. En lo personal Android siempre me ha parecido que procesa las fotos de un modo raro, y siempre se ven de poca calidad, o demasiado digitalizadas. Sin embargo, para lo que cuesta un iPhone 13 o 14, mejor compro por separado una cámara semiprofesional. Para los recuerditos y compartir fotos en el momento con la familia esta cámara funciona bien.Fuera de la cámara, todo lo demás es una maravilla. La batería carga rapidísimo y la carga dura mucho tiempo. Aún después de ponerle batería nueva original al iPhone 7 tenía que cargarlo siempre diario, a veces hasta dos veces al día por la lentitud de la carga y era necesario llevar un banco de energía o podía quedarme sin teléfono en la tarde noche.Casi todos mis servicios (Calendario, Contactos, servicios en la nube, Música, noticias, podcasts, etc) están con google y la integración de estos con Android es impecable.

I suoi principali punti di forza sono:- Design robusto con certificazione IP68/IP69K per resistenza ad acqua, polvere e urti- Ampia batteria da 13.200 mAh per un'autonomia di diversi giorni- Processore MediaTek Helio G99 octa-core- Fotocamera principale da 108MP- Display da 6,58 pollici FHD+- Sistema operativo Android 13Il dispositivo si distingue per la sua resistenza e l'enorme batteria, ideale per chi lavora all'aperto o in condizioni difficili. Le prestazioni sono nella media per questa fascia di prezzo.Le piccole criticità sono il peso e le dimensioni, ma è chiaro che se lo si vuole usare come faccio io per un lavoro dove acqua e polvere la fanno da padroni, diventa una condizione imprescindibile, oltre a un comparto fotografico non eccezionale nonostante i 108MP sulla carta, ma anche qui se volevo un camera phone avrei preso altro.,quindi non mi lamento.Nel complesso, è una buona scelta per chi, come me, cerca uno smartphone ultra resistente e con batteria quasi infinita, sacrificando però portabilità e alcune funzionalità avanzate.In conclusione in questa fascia di prezzo e per l'utilizzo che ne devo fare, va più che bene.Consegna sempre impeccabile con la Logistica di Amazon, veloce precisa e gratuita con Prime in meno di 24 ore.Grazie per l'attenzione.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Global warmer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Devo dire che ero partito con aspettative molto basse, sono rimasto molto piacevolmente sorpreso dalla qualità generale del prodotto e dalla fattura solida E funzionale\nRead more'}]",,B0DHP45B7F,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0DHP45B7F,5g

Reported ""issues"" maybe overblown.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020', 'Review Body': 'Great phone.  Really enjoying my first week with it.PROS:All the pros are fairly well documented online so I won\'t dwell too much on them. Loving the 90hz refresh, the comfortable size, the small bezels, the 5G, the pure Android experience, the fast wireless charging, the super quick fingerprint scanner, and the excellent battery life.NON-ISSUES (FOR ME):I had a few concerns going in which turned out to be non-issues for me:1) Gap between screen and body: There were many reports online of an inconsistent gap between the screen and aluminum body of the phone, with an especially large gap near the corner with the camera.  Maybe I got lucky, but did not have this issue.  There\'s a VERY small gap on my phone, but it\'s consistent all the way around, appears to be by design, and doesn\'t bother me at all.2) Speakers: I\'m coming from a Pixel 2 which has stereo front firing speakers.  While I do notice the lack of stereo sound on the Pixel 5, I found the overall volume and clarity of the Pixel 5 to be better actually.  Does it compete with the best phones out there in terms of sound?  Probably not.  But for my purposes it is more than adequate.  I also found the behind-screen speaker for phone calls to be fine.  It\'s a little weird for the whole phone to vibrate when someone\'s talking, but I\'ve already gotten used to it.3) Old camera hardware: Coming from a Pixel 2 which takes good photos, the Pixel 5 is incrementally better.  It\'s not going to compete with an iPhone 12 Pro in all departments, but it\'s still good even though the main camera hardware is a couple years old.  Wide-angle is nice to have.4) Midrange processor: I really haven\'t noticed this being an issue yet.  Granted, I don\'t do a ton of photo processing or gaming on the phone.  But for everyday tasks it\'s totally fine.  Definitely faster and snappier than my Pixel 2, and the 90hz makes it all look buttery smooth.5) Lack of squeeze-for-assistant: I\'m already getting used to swiping up from the corner.  Not really missing this feature as much as I thought I would.MINOR CONS:1) The bio-resin on edges near the screen seems a little rough, and the cutout for the USB-C port could have been rounded a bit so the edge wasn\'t so ""sharp"".  Neither seem like defects, but I used to use my pinky as a ledge to sit the phone on, and now that\'s a little uncomfortable.  Just an adjustment I\'ll need to make.  I don\'t use a case, so if you\'re planning on using one this issue will be moot for you.2) Screen viewing angle seems slightly narrow.  In normal use this is not an issue, but it it\'s not quite as good as an iPhone XS or 11.3) No telephoto.  I\'ve never had one so I don\'t know what I\'m missing.  I think I have more use for wide-angle so it\'s an ok tradeoff for me, but it would have been nice to have telephoto too.  If you have a Pixel 4 and use the telephoto a lot, this might not be the upgrade path for you.4) This is more of an Android 11/app developer issue, but a lot of apps, including some Google apps like Chrome, don\'t do a good job of showing off the small uniform bezels on the Pixel 5.  You still end up with black bars at the top and bottom in most cases behind the notification area at the top and the gesture line at the bottom.  They should really be transparent, especially at the bottom.  Maybe that\'ll improve with time, but it\'s hard to actually appreciate the nice bezels on the phone on anything but the home screen.All in all, this is a 5-star phone for me.  Looks great, and it\'s well rounded.  Recommended.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'mr newyork', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Solid Performance with Impressive Camera Features', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The design is sleek and feels premium in hand, with the Sorta Sage color adding a unique and subtle touch of personality. One of the biggest highlights of the Pixel 5 is its camera. The Night Sight feature is outstanding, capturing clear and vibrant photos even in low light conditions. The ultrawide lens is a great addition too, allowing for more creative shots and better landscape photography. The camera performance overall is one of the best you can find in this price range.Performance-wise, the Pixel 5 handles everyday tasks smoothly. Whether it’s browsing, streaming, or multitasking, the phone keeps up without any noticeable lag. However, if you’re into heavy gaming or demanding apps, you might notice some limitations. But for most users, it’s more than sufficient.The water resistance gives peace of mind for accidental spills or using the phone in the rain, and the battery life is solid, easily lasting a full day with moderate use.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'KF', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent Smartphone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020', 'Review Body': ""I'm reluctant to pay this much for a smartphone as they're pretty much a consumable these days.  That said, the Pixel 5 is a fantastic phone.  Clean, vanilla Android, snappy performance, beautiful pictures and battery for days sum it up.  The cell and WiFi radios outperform my Essential phone by a country mile. I can make phone calls on Verizon from my house, something the last three phones were not able to do reliably.  It will stay connected to our spotty WiFi better than any other phone or tablet I've owned.  The pictures are nicely exposed and vibrant in any but the poorest conditions.  It's a great size and weight for a smartphone.  The screen looks rich and smooth as silk, but not oversaturated.  The fingerprint sensor isn't as reliable as I'd like, and that it's surface looks like the texture on the rest of the back of the phone means that you can't glance at it to see if it's clean.  And if it's to work, it needs to be really, really clean.  The fit and finish is nice, and I didn't get an example with the half installed screen.  I like the texture that's been applied to the body, even if it reminds me of Plastidip.  The phone feels solid, but not overly weighty.  It's sits in a jeans pocket nicely.  Sits nicely in the hand, too.  Just enough weight.  Just enough.  The GPS receiver appears to be quite a bit more sensitive than any previous phone of mine.  It locks in on location fast, and in many places others never see the satellites.  Wireless charging is, well, nice, if not the ultimate experience.  Most of that is not an reflection of the phone.  It's nice to be able to just lay the phone on a charger for the night.  Small, round chargers, however, leave the phone vulnerable to being knocked off the nightstand.  I switched to one that's a rounded rectangle, similar in size to the phone.  Happiness.  And, it's easier to get the phone placed relative to the charger's coil so that it will charge.  Wireless charging is slow, of course, but the Pixel 5 will charge from 15% to full overnight.  Speaking of charging, the Pixel 5 is relatively slow to charge when plugged into USB-C, but not to the point of being a real problem.  Just don't expect to throw 50% charge on it while you're in the shower.  I'm still learning the camera app, but it's more than good enough from what I've seen so far.  Portrait Light would be useful on any subject, but Google only shows the control if they think the subject is human.  Yes, some of us take pictures of cats, too, and that lighting magic would be nice to have.  Maybe it will develop enough over time to be used in any picture.So, all in all, the Pixel 5 is a significant upgrade, and an outstanding smartphone experience.  I do recommend.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Abel Ruiz C.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on June 25, 2022', 'Review Body': 'No son nuevos, pedí el color verde y venía en una caja de un pixel 5 pero negro.

My service provider can\'t get it to work. Nokia ""fixed it"" and returned it to me, but it\'s still broken.

Using on TMobile.Pet peeves would be the be fingerprint reader location makes it so easy to unlock that nearly every time you put it in your pocket it's going in unlocked without your noticing. The amount of pocket dials is insane. I've disabled it at this point which is unfortunate. You can do lockdown via power button but that's a pain for how frequently I get in to my phone. Face recognition is hit or miss with my various glasses and masks.Power button is extremely sensitive. After turning off fingerprint reading it was almost always going into camera mode in my pocket, turning off or simply reading/watching on the phone.The bulge for the camera is concerning how much it forces that to be the main point of contact when setting it down but so far so good.Google assistant button is a joke. Easy to disable but just unfortunate there's no good way to remap it. I don't really need the button in general so no biggy.Programmable button on the top is useful but takes some practice getting used to. It's hard to find  due to size and slightly recessed. Moved camera to it but you have to unlock to use. Flashlight be works great on it locked or unlocked.Camera software can be very laggy. Not ideal for those who need to get a quick spur of the moment picture. You might get it but it'll act like it's still waiting to take a picture for several moments and you wont know right away. Worse when using it in apps like Whatsapp or messenger.While I have several complaints it's still been a big improvement in use and just being newer.Some silly pros are the swipe up to unlock confuses my wife and daughter who are hardcore iphone users. they have yet to even get to the pin stage of unlocking it.Very durable. Toddler throws it when she finds it and still looks new.

Si solo son algunas gotas no muy grandes, puedes seguir haciendo tap sin problema y con precisión.Actualización después de 1 año y 2 meses: Sigue igual que la ocasión en la que hice esta reseña. Ni una diferencia. Ni siquiera he tenido problemas con el centro de carga como sí lo llegué a tener con otros. Definitivamente vale la pena la reducción en las características por su resistencia.

I got it because it's similar to my NUU B-15 smartphone with how it's set up inside with same features. It was fairly easy to set up, as most Android smartphones are and works well with my T-Mobile service plan. It takes decent photos and videos....not Apple I-Phone great, but decent photos.  It's a 4G smartphone and has plenty of internal storage (256 GB) for apps, photos, videos, music, etc. You can add a Micro-SD card for additional storage space too.  It has 16 GB of memory RAM.....general low demand games works well with this Cubot smartphone. It has a side mounted fingerprint thingie like my NUU smartphone has and like that NUU phone & it works most of the time just fine. You can also use a PIN to lock/unlock this smartphone. Battery life is okay and takes quite awhile to fully charge up this phone.  I cannot adjust the refresh rate either, most smartphones you can adjust the screen refresh rate, but not on this Cubot smartphone. This Cubot smartphone has a very good 120 hz screen refresh rate because it seems to scroll pretty smoothly around. Overall, I rated this Cubot smartphone 4 of 5 mostly due to the minor issues with this phone, including fairly long battery recharging, and also not even knowing how to adjust the screen refresh rate. For basic use, this Cubot phone has been pretty good overall so far and it bears a strong resemblance to either an Apple Iphone 13 or 14 Pro due to it's triple camera set up on the camera's backside and the camera lens even protrude out a bit from the camera body, just like the Apple Iphones. Camera does take decent photos, but most likely not quite as good as Apple Iphones photo qualities are though. I think Cubot did their homework quite well with this smartphone, the P-80.

Extremely fast shipment for me.  Even though this was my first time using an unlocked phone, things went flawlessly as soon as I realized what I was doing.  Setup took a day, but that was due to it being a learning process for me.The Phone is the Latin version, not the US Version.  I just selected English (US) and you can\'t tell.  This unit offers double the built in memory than the US versions, but is NOT compatible with all carriers, check to make sure this specific VERSION works with your carrier, not just ""Samsung A54"", since Samsung offers two versions of the A54.  Mine worked fine (Metro/Tmobile).Face recognition is sub par, It usually doesn\'t unlock on face.  all the time.  The fingerprint sensor can store three fingerprints, it would be nice to have four so I can register both index and thumb on both hands.the camera is good, but like many Samsung phones, it seems it\'s over exposed.  It took good pictures at night, but not professional camera quality.  Overall, I would say it is a good camera with good color pickup, but I wouldn\'t use it for any professional I included some pics from our trip to Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge Tn. in various lighting to see what it would look like in an unskilled hand.  Overall, I am pleased with the camera.Battery wise, it lasted the whole day  + evening with full use.  GPS signal bounced around the mountains and couldn\'t get an accurate gps at all times.  Overall, my wife\'s I-phone got slightly better cell reception in troubled areas, but they were close.  All wi-fi connections came in clear and fast in the dead zones.  Size wise, it was able to fit well in a standard short\'s pocket nicely.  The phone is slightly heavier than the other entry level phones I\'ve owned, which seems to be better for gripping.Overall, I would say it was a great purchase.  cheaper than getting it through my provider, and double the built in storage than what they can provide.  A good step up from entry level, but not awe inspiring like the flagship phones.  It\'s just a good solid phone.**Added update:  Everything is the same, but found out why the signal was bounced around so much.  This phone does work with MetroPCS and at 5g, but this particular version only supports the high 5g frequency, but not the lower frequency.  Lower frequencies have a longer range, but  less data speeds.  So in the areas where you do not get a good 5g signal, you can usually get a good low frequency signal (4g?).  But this phone and metro PCS, it\'s has to rely only on the 5g.  Where I live, this is not much of an  issue, so check your service provider to make sure  this phone has both a 5g and an extended range signal that works with your carrier if you live  on the fringe of their service (which is quite huge in the US)  -- Even with this knowlege, it was a perfect purchase for me.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stanley V', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good Value. Nice Cameras. Slightly smaller than A53.

Overall, I think it's a very good value, and don't see the need to spend $1000+ on a phone when this one works great for less than $400. I DO RECOMMEND YOU GET A CASE; otherwise it's hard to hold. You can get cases on Amazon or other sites specifically for the Samsung A54 that protect it well for about $20, or you can spend $50 and get a GREAT case.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Zane', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'NOT Unlocked, NOT Sold by Samsung..', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I bought this phone and took it to Boost Mobile for activation. Only to be told that the phone is NOT factory unlocked, so now I have to return it. Also this phone isn\'t even sold directly by Samsung, it\'s sold by some sketchy company called ""Cell Universal"". The fact they call this ""Unlocked Worldwide"" is a total lie, and I don\'t even know how they get away with putting that in the title. Aside from all that the phone itself is nice, display looks good, camera is nice, and the speakers are pretty solid. However, none of that even matters if this phone doesn\'t support my carrier. Might I also mention the reason I bought this phone was because my current phone, an S21 Ultra, broke the other day for seemingly no reason. I bought the S21 here on Amazon, I got it refurbished from another 3rd party seller. Take this as a lesson, do NOT buy a phone unless it\'s coming DIRECTLY from Samsung or Apple. Also, if you really want a new phone, it\'s also a good idea to go and buy one in person rather then online.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sebastián Dodera Padrón', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Typical Samsung mobile phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024', 'Review Body': ""One of the reasons I purchased this mobile phone model was the large storage capacity of the phone (256 Gb) and that it works with 5G. Do not expect this phone to be something unusual or better than other Samsung' previous models. It just performs as good as many Samsung phones that I had during the years. It is reliable, has a decent screen, camera works great and provides the same kind of satisfaction with the remaining apps or software installed in it that other old versions did, it is a pity that this one does not come with a radio app from factory. Don't take the description in the page as 100% accurate, the phone doesn't include a charger as it is advertised and also it doesn't have a 3.5mm jack to plug most wired earphones which makes the use of an adapter mandatory.

A budget-friendly smartphone boasting 16GB RAM, 256GB of onboard storage, and an Octa-core processor? It sounded too good to be true, but curiosity got the better of me. Now, after a few weeks of putting this device through its paces, I can confidently say that the N55PRO is a game-changer in the mid-range smartphone market.Design & DisplayThe first thing that struck me was the N55PRO’s sleek design. The 6.56” HD+ display, with its 90 Hz refresh rate, is a treat for the eyes. Colors are vibrant, text is crisp, and the refresh rate makes scrolling buttery smooth. It’s a solid, well-built device that feels great in hand—not too bulky, but not flimsy either. DOOGEE has managed to strike a balance between modern aesthetics and practical design, which is no small feat.PerformanceNow, onto the star of the show—the performance. With 16GB of RAM and an Octa-core processor under the hood, the N55PRO doesn’t just handle everyday tasks; it dominates them. Multitasking is a breeze, and apps open almost instantaneously. I threw everything at it, from heavy gaming to streaming high-definition content, and it never once broke a sweat. The device’s capability to expand storage up to 1TB is a massive bonus for those like me who hoard photos, videos, and apps like a digital squirrel.Camera QualityThe camera setup, though not flagship-level, holds its own. The 13MP rear camera captures decent shots with good detail, especially in well-lit conditions. The 8MP front-facing camera is perfect for selfies and video calls, delivering sharp and natural-looking images. While it might not replace your DSLR, for everyday snaps and social media uploads, the N55PRO does the job admirably.Battery LifeThe 5150 mAh battery is an unsung hero. It easily gets me through a full day of heavy use, with some juice left for the next morning. Whether I’m gaming, streaming, or navigating through GPS on a long drive, the N55PRO just keeps going. Plus, the OTG support is a handy feature for charging other devices on the go.Software & ExtrasRunning on Android 14, the user interface is clean, intuitive, and devoid of unnecessary bloatware. The Widevine L1 certification is a cherry on top, ensuring that streaming HD content from services like Netflix is a smooth experience. The inclusion of features like GPS and Face ID adds to the overall appeal, making the N55PRO a well-rounded package.VerdictIn conclusion, the DOOGEE N55PRO is a powerhouse of a phone disguised as a budget-friendly option. It’s perfect for those who want top-tier performance without breaking the bank. Whether you’re a power user, a casual gamer, or someone who just wants a reliable smartphone, the N55PRO will not disappoint. It’s rare to find a device that ticks all the boxes, but DOOGEE has managed to pull it off. Highly recommended!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'BryanFarme', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Some Good Specs', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This low to mid ranger is pretty decent given the $180 price tag.

(My husband accidentally ran over my old one.)  It is not my first experience with ""off brand"" or budget phones, but it has been one of the best.  I am not a techie, so these are just a lay person\'s impressions.First, it is about the same size and weight as my old phone (which was a Samsung), with the same size screen.  It came with a case (although I would like a better one) and a screen protector, but without all the bloatware.  The screen is brighter and clearer than the Samsung, and it is superfast and responsive.  There is no lag or hesitation when switching between apps.  Watching videos or TV is clear and crisp.  The photos it takes (I\'m not much of a photographer) are also sharp.Set-up was easy (thanks mostly to Google), and using the phone has been a great experience so far.  Battery life if good although not exceptional.

Tracfone /Verizon IS compatible after you put in the correct APN setting.  After hours & hours of checking my phone for problems I finally found it was due to the WRONG APN (ACCSESS POINT NETWORK SETTING), Tracfone Carrier gave the Samsung Galaxy A 15 5G phone the wrong setting which WAS:  (VZWENTP) which does not work with these phones.  Tracfone just changed the setting to:  (VZWINTERNET) which does CONNECT YOU TO YOUR Tracfone NETWORK.  You can change this yourself if you have Tracfone as your Carrier.  After you complete the update setting don\'t forget to reboot your phone. I hope I have helped my fellow Customers with a situation that may have caused you to think your phone was defective for sure.

I'm on the 4G/LTE network, but the 5G band IS connected, so probably switching over next month at the end of this prepaid plan.Comes with quick start guide, a 3 ft usb-c to usb-c cable, and that's it.IMPORTANT TO NOTE:  The phone does NOT come with a case or a charger.  I bought this knowing that, but don't order this and then be disappointed or angry at what's not included.  I knew that though, so it didn't bother me.  Already have ordered a very high quality Anker charger and Spigen case to arrive in a couple of days for less than Samsung sells theirs.Overall, it's been money well spent, and the OLED screen is absolutely lovely.  I've set it to 60hz (it runs at 90) to save battery life a little more, I don't play high leverage games on it.Only gripe is that Samsung phones come with a lot of bloat, so I've been deleting some of the native Samsung and preinstalled apps.  Research it and find out what's safe to delete, and you'll be happy.  Didn't remove a star for that or the non-case/charger, because the price is so good.UPDATE:  Have really been enjoying the phone, everything runs smooth even at the lower screen speed, the screen really pops in a lovely way, lots of rich colour and deep blacks, definitely an upgrade if you're on an older budget phone and are looking for something newer.  Highly recommend for those on a budget.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'George', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Australia on July 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'received phone on time and easy to start up as I expected.no any issues.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Louis', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 30, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I am pleased with the phone.

So far, I have minimal 5G support where I live (who knew? 🙄) So while it works great on my home wifi it's not as reliable when I'm out. Texts don't always send/receive and the signal is spotty.

Our first purchase never came.  We ordered on May 24, 2024 and on July 1, 2024 I called customer support, wondering what was taking so long.  The item page said it was available and they had 4 in stock.  Go figure...  I ended up canceling that order, as per the service agent suggested and ordered another.  The same thing happened, the company kept telling me it was in process but kept extending the arrival date.  What the heck?  So after 2 weeks of this, I canceled that second order.  I found a refurbished one, exactly like the first one, and tried that.  I have it in my hands and it is working perfectly.  Too bad it took so long and the Motorola Store lost out on that sale.  I must say I was beginning to feel discriminated against even though there could be no reason.  But why did they sell a product they said was in stock and then not ship it to me?

Sei es zum schnellen Fotografieren,  Kundenanfragen beantworten oder in der Normenbibliothek nachsehen. Für all diese Tätigkeiten ist mir jedoch mein privates teures Smartphone zu schade, da man ständig dreckige Finger hat oder alles staubig ist. Deswegen habe ich ein robustes Outdoorhandy gesucht, welches nicht zu teuer ist und gut funktioniert. Dieses hier hat mich von der Beschreibung sehr überzeugt und am Ende auch positiv überrascht.Ich habe es jetzt mehrere Tage in Betrieb und konnte bisher nichts negatives feststellen. Klar es ist nicht mit einem teuren Smartphone namenhafter Hersteller zu vergleichen,  sei es bei der Fotoqualität oder Geschwindigkeit. Trotzdem brauch das Telefon sich definitiv nicht verstecken.  Es ist sehr gut verpackt und im Lieferumfang befindet sich neben dem Telefon,  eine Anleitung, eine Garantiekarte, ein USB Kabel, ein Netzteil und eine Displayschutzfolie. Alle Teile am Telefon sind gut verarbeitet. Die Tasten und Knöpfe lassen sich gut bedienen. Der Rahmen und die Ecken sind mit Gummi geschützt. Fällt das Telefon auf den Boden, so bleibt es heile. Das Display ist ein wenig tiefer als der Rahmen und somit sehr gut geschützt. Der Touchscreen reagiert schnell und oft flüssig. Natürlich ist die Hardware nicht die Schnellste,  aber nutzt man das Telefon wirklich nur beruflich,  müllt man ja auch nicht alles mit sinnlosen Apps zu, die das Telefon verlangsamen. Die Kamera (50 MP hinten, 16 MP vorne, mit LED Licht) reagiert schnell und die Fotos sind für Schnappschüsse ausreichend gut.  Der riesige Akku hält mit seiner Kapazität von 10800 mAh ewig. Ich lade das Telefon alle 2-3 Tage vollständig auf. Induktives Laden unterstützt das Telefon ebenfalls. Alle Anschlüsse sind mit einer Schutzkappe versehen,  da dass Telefon IP68 zertifiziert ist. Das Telefon liegt wirklich sehr gut in der Hand und ist rutschfest. Das Gewicht ist noch akzeptabel, bei dem riesigen Akku. Man merkt das man ein robustes Handy in der Hand hat, welches auch wie eine Powerbank optisch wirkt. Die Sprachqualität ist sehr gut, je nach Netzempfang. Alle anderen Funktionen,  sei GPS Navigation oder die klassische SMS/MMS funktionieren einwandfrei. Die Internetverbindung ist auch über WLAN ausreichend schnell. Bisher hat das Gerät keine Probleme verursacht und besonders toll ist auch die NFC Funktion.Fazit:Für einen noch günstigen Preis, bekommt man hier ein wirklich robustes Smartphone,  welches gut funktioniert. Es ist kein High End Telefon,  aber das Ziel hat der Hersteller wohl auch nicht verfolgt. Es wurde ein robustes Outdoor Handy gebaut und so kann sich das gute Telefon auch nennen. Es ist kein Alltagstelefon, alleine schon wegen der Größe und dem Gewicht. Für meine Zwecke ist es völlig ausreichend und deshalb gibt es fünf Sterne von mir.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rocco Pelullo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on July 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Ein Robustes Outdoor-SmartphoneDas DOOGEE S PUNK ist ein Outdoor-Smartphone, das speziell für anspruchsvolle Bedingungen entwickelt wurde.

Diese ist mit eSIM-Support, 5G und aktuellem Prozessor definitiv im Bereich der Mittelklasse und im Top-Bereich was Outdoor-Smartphones betrifft.1) Ja, es geht aus der Produktbeschreibung nicht wirklich hervor. Das Smartphone unterstützt induktives Laden, was extrem wichtig ist. Ich habe drei induktive Ladepunkte welche ich bislang für mein S20 benutzt habe und alle funktionieren problemlos mit dem Doogee V30. Es lädt schnell und zuverlässig, da hat man mit manchen Hüllen mehr Probleme. Nur den Halter im Auto (automatisch schließender Telefonhalter mit induktivem Laden) musste ich leicht modifizieren, weil die Klammern immer auf den Ausschaltknopf gedrückt haben wenn sie zugefahren sind.2) Ergonomie: Gewicht und Größe sind im Alltag nicht das Problem, wenn man mit guten Cargohosen unterwegs ist und Handschuhgröße L-XL trägt. Man gewöhnt sich an die Dimensionen. Durch Gewicht und Dimensionen hat es gerade bei sehr langer Benutzung auch Vorteile, es liegt satt und stabil in der Hand, man krampft nicht und hat es sicherer im Griff als kleinere Smartphones. Speziell wenn man etwas grobmotorischer veranlagt ist wie ich ;-) Die große Schwachstelle ist der Hauptschalter mit dem Fingerabdruckscanner: Er liegt ungeschützt, wird oft unabsichtlich betätigt und hat auch eine prominente, scharfe Kante. Doogee hätte die Seitenleisten nicht mit aufwändigen Holzelementen schön gestalten sollen, sondern dort für Grip und Gummierung sorgen müssen. Jetzt erledigt das bei mir Tape wie man es auf Skateboards klebt: Beide Seitenschalter sind damit gut geschützt, werden nicht mehr oft unabsichtlich betätigt und das V30 wird mir auch unter widrigen Bedingungen nie aus der Hand gleiten.3) Kamera: Die Hauptkamera liefert bei Kunstlicht oft extrem gelbstichige Videos und Bilder. Die Kameraapp ist nicht sehr gut, sehr beschränkt im Umfang. Mit der Weißbalance lässt sich der Gelbstich ausgleichen aber das ist mühsam. Ansonsten sind die Bilder und Videos gut. Die Frontkamera ist im Vergleich besser und liefert normale Farben. Generell kann das V30 hier nicht mit dem S20 mithalten. Highlight: Die Nachtsichtfunktion im IR-Leds ist ganz toll und liefert genug Leistung für mittelgroße Innenräume. Das ist ein echter Mehrwert!4) Tägliche Nutzung: Naturbelassenes Android, keine Bloatware, frei programmierbarer Seitenschalter links - nice! Das V30 liefert tollen Sound, hat halt auch einen guten Resonanzkörper. Telefon und Mikros sind einwandfrei. Die  Verbindungen sind alle stabil (nicht unter 5G getestet!), in der täglichen Nutzung ist es keine Spur hinter meinem S20. Alles geht flott, der Bildschirm ist größer und besser (bis zu 120HZ), mit Spielen habe ich es nicht getestet aber man merkt das das Doogee viel Leistung hat. Tja: Die Batterie: Komplett irre, mehrtägige intensive Nutzungen sind absolut möglich, im Normalbetrieb hat man Reserven ohne Ende. Es ist sicher nicht nur der Akku groß sondern auch die Hardware effizient, zudem hat man Stromsparoptionen ohne Ende.Fazit: In der täglichen mehrwöchigen Nutzung habe ich mich an das V30 gewöhnt. Es übertrifft mein Galaxy S20 in vielen Bereichen, außer den Kameras wo es sich Schwächen leistet. Damit wird es zu meinem Primärtelefon, das S20 wird für Videos, Drohnenflüge abgestellt und geht ansonsten in die Reserve. Das V30 ist einfach besser. Wenn man mit der Ergonomie zurecht kommt dann bekommt man hier ein gutes Gerät. Ich hoffe auf ein Softwareupdate bei der Kamera. Doogee sollte bei zukünftigen Ausführungen dringend die Seitenleisten und Seitenschalter überarbeiten, vom edlen Aussehen kann ich nicht leben. Das V30 ist ein Panzer, da lege ich wenig bis keinen Wert auf stilistische Exkursionen ohne funktionalen Mehrwert, speziell wenn ich mir dann selber was improvisieren muss. Nett wäre auch ein Loch für einen Lanyard oder Karabiner.Das Doogee V30 ist ein schwer gepanzertes und auf Mittelklasseniveau starkes Smartphone welches topaktuelle Technik unterstützt, schön gemacht ist, Ambitionen zeigt und extreme Stärken wie den Akku bietet ohne sich extreme Schwächen zu leisten. Je nach Preis ist es eine exzellente Option!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'davide albertin', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on August 6, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Visto la mia attività lavorativa sempre con lo smartphone in mano e dopo varie cadute e molti soldi spesi in riparazioni ho deciso di dotarmi di un rugged in modo da stare tranquillo ed essere molto più protetto , ma sempre con un occhio alla performance del telefono per le varie app che utilizzo.Era subito disponibile dal venditore e ho fatto l’acquisto,ricevendo il pacchetto in pochissimo tempo !Apriamo le scatole e la prima cosa che vediamo è il corpo metallico In generale lo è davvero telefono dall'aspetto molto bello e insolito almeno lo è davvero protetto, mettiamolo subito da parte troveremo cavi da tipo C a tipo C l'unità di ricarica e ricarica è di 33 W quindi è supportata la ricarica rapidaNella confezione ci sono anche le istruzioni ti spiegherà come usare il telefono.

At home, I plug it into an Ethernet cord + adapter for downloading audio books, podcasts and music (without using wireless). In the past I have had a pay-as-you go plan from TMobile for $30/month. But for how much data I use (typically 1G or less per month), $30 seemed too much to spend. For the most recent couple years I used a 7"" tablet plan (with 1G of data/month) from verizon $8.mo, instead of a phone. I could not get a ""tablet plan"" with a regular cell phone - Verizon won\'t do it - and it became annoying to have to use a tablet on the go because the size forced me to carry a lager bag than I wanted. When my tablet broke it was time to find another solution!In comes TELLO + the Unihertz JELLY2!!!This wonderful little phone + a plan of my choosing with Tello has been a perfect solution for me. I wish I had found Tello earlier. My Tello sim is using tmobile towers which have worked every time I need to pull up a map or send a text (I live in the country in NH). I pay for 1G of data and $100 minutes for $6 per month! It is exactly what I need, no more no less. If I ever need more data I can buy another Gig for $5. My usage is pulling up an occasional Map (then turning Airplay mode back on & keeping on location to navigate), texting via Telegram & Google voice, browsing/searching, or a very brief phone call.This little phone works great. The flashlight is helpful. The camera quality is very good. Battery life is great. Swipe text works great. Android apps I use such as Audible, Napster, google maps, Telegram, Google Voice, Protonmail work great. It fits in a pocket and allows me to wear my small purse again that larger phones won\'t fit in! It is the kind of phone that works for what you need, but also minimizes the addictive effects of larger phones simply by being just a bit too small to escape into. This is great for those who are choosing to back away from cell phone use/addiction.IMO, streaming should be done through a wired connection, at home, with a projector or at least a computer screen... treated more like movie night. At home you can stream without toxic wireless exposure (from WiFi, Bluetooth and 4G/5G) by using an Ethernet connection and a $9 USB C to Ethernet Adapter adapter.In short, this phone will help you emancipate yourself from cell phone slavery and put the cell phone back in its proper place as a tool and nothing more.  Enjoy life, slow down, be present for your in person relationships, learn skills, dance, sing, create beauty; invest in your life. Don\'t allow the cell phone to steal your life from you. Recognize that social media is anti-social and prevents you from investing in your real life. This cute little tool will help you demote your phone back to being just that, a tool. It is a great price AND, you will very quickly save money if you get rid of your costly monthly ""unlimited"" plan and replace it with paying for only what you need with Tello.I highly recommend this phone!

However, on loudspeaker, it IS. Even if I can hear music on its loudspeaker fine, it\'s not stereo quality (and it just has one speaker). So, don\'t expect Dolby-style sound like you would on your Galaxy S21. Some of the sound on certain YouTube videos aren\'t very loud, unfortunately and you won\'t be able to hear it well on this phone. I\'d say use bluetooth speakers or use a headset (hey it DOES have 3.5mm HEADPHONE JACK, so, there is HOPE after all, for many of us who PREFER a wired headset over bluetooth buds), but, you would probably say ""why? I would rather just get a better phone than that, then"". Well, okay, then. I ain\'t your papa. You do you, ok? The camera is standard, in my opinion. You can\'t expect super high Samsung quality photos on a small, albeit mighty, phone. Pics taken in low lighting aren\'t 100% great, but, it does a fine job, depending on your liking. If your kink is in photography, i don\'t think I would recommend taking pictures all the time with this phone. I do think unihertz has potential to up the ante on a better quality camera if they ever make a Jelly 3. Now, in terms of video quality...same deal. Average videos. Sound recorded is clear and adequate at best, but at worst, it sounds raspy.  Playing the videos I recorded with this phone on my 4K television was how I determined that. Recording at full HD res and with flash didn\'t do it much justice either. But, as far as I\'m concerned, it\'s still a hell of a lot better than what you get for with other phones costing under $200, although I understand POCO phones and Realme phones have much better camera and video quality at just below $300.Although, those are not the real beef I have with this phone. The real beef is the BATTERY.At 2000mAh, I mean...you gotta be kidding me. There are bigger phones with that battery size that lasts longer. If they equipped it with a 3000mAh battery, I probably wouldn\'t be complaining. The first 2 days I used my phone with all it\'s normal functions, apps, phone calls, etc., my phone lasted 7 hours at most. Luckily I always carry a powerbank with me, so I had to charge this little sucker up to full power, which took about 2 hours. So, not bad on the charging at this point.I used my phone in different settings just to see how I could extend battery life. First, I just kept refraining from using the phone unless I had to reply to a serious message or make necessary phone calls, and I would use a bluetooth dialer to answer any other phone call. That did work, but I managed to only gain an extra 2-3 hours of extra life. So, not very much help. Then I used the battery saver function, while using bluetooth dialer to make and answer calls. A little more decent. I just gained an extra 5 hours of life. That was the only upside, but, still, not at all pleased with the battery life of this phone. They could have given the phone a 3000 mAh and I would get a decent 16 hours of use, if not a full day.All in all, you get what you pay for. It\'s a cute phone. I won\'t deny that. I love it. I just wish that, while it is value for money, a lot more could have been done to this little gem. Better camera and video quality and stabilization as well, and a longer-lasting battery.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Constable spécial', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on June 1, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Petit compact parfait\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lila', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on March 1, 2023', 'Review Body': 'compré este celular en junio 2022 y para febrero 2023 ya no sirve el botón físico rojo que usaba para tomar capturas de pantalla. algún centro unihertz en México, D.F. o area metropolitana? para que arreglen el botón.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Atejam', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on July 24, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I'm not happy.after 3 months having this just yesterday it didn't work well.i have 3 phone and this jelly is just for my back up phone for my online transactions.i didn't use it if not needed to transact anything like once a week but then the screen didn't work well.also the battery is easy to drain like 6hours .I cannot used the back and next button even swipe it really not work!

The first issue came when the device arrived and was at 0% charge, I plugged it in and let it sit while I was at work. When I returned home, the phone was still at 0%. I ended up putting the phone on a wireless charger and it would accept a charge that way. I contacted the seller as well as Asurion, since I had got the extended service contract to help if there were any issues along the way. Asurion advised me that since it was within 30 days they couldn\'t repair it, so I contacted the seller to see if there was anything that could be done. They offered to have me send the device back for a refund, and I decided that since the only issue was the charging port, I\'d wait and have it repaired after 30 days, because to send it back and wait for another phone to come in was disadvantageous.The next issue came when the device started to randomly just get a black screen and wouldn\'t respond, upon having that issue I contacted Asurion again. Here is where the biggest issue came in to play, the service fee they charged was $89, and when looking at the phone there were half of the screws missing internally that hold down the daughterboard and charging board, so the ""renewed"" status was not right.

As the phone case I had ordered was also missing, I'm left to assume that someone along the way decided to steal it, so buyers need to watch out for that potentiality. However, customer support was quick to find me a replacement, and am I ever glad they did!The phone I received is fantastic. Out of the box, it looks brand new. There are no dings, no scratches, and everything works as expected. It was unlocked as advertised. The biggest draw for me to even purchase this phone was the camera, and I'm not disappointed in the slightest!As I've purchased those phone exclusively to be used as a camera, I cannot speak to how any of the call or text features work. It's doing its job for what I need it for and that's all that matters to me.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'K.C.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'AS GOOD AS NEW', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I just received this today and just transferred over all of my data.

I was initially upset because the phone wasn't arriving at the time promised, but an hour or so after my review the phone indeed arrived instead of waiting one more day as Amazon was letting me know. The phone is in great conditions. No scratched, dents, or anything visible to me. It is indeed unlocked and already connected to my cell phone provider with no issues. So far the phone has been working well. It seems as the battery life might have a little issue, but I'm not entirely sure as of yet. In the time it's taken me to write this review the percentage did go down by 2% which I feel it might be draining quick and that's why I'm giving only a 4 star review for now. As days go by I will keep an eye on the battery life and if I feel I made a mistake I will definitely change my review to a 5 star. Everything else on the phone looks great. Apps are running great. Definitely would recommend this seller. Will update soon.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Margarita', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on August 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Me gustó mucho, viene en excelente condición solamente donde se inserta el cable del cargador viene un poco rayado  son cositas insignificantes los detalles, batallé para poder usar mi chip pero no fue imposible, toma fotos muy bonitas y videos tambien no se queda atrás, el dia q lo use para ponerle mi chip y tu todo lo que requiere se calentó mucho, ya otros días todo normal, la pila me dura todo el día y hasta ne me queda un 30 y tantos de porcentaje al final del día, tenía miedo de lo que me fuera a llegar pero la vdd que salió excelente.

Then overtime it started giving me issues with water being in the port when there never was, and the most stupidest thing this person ever made was not giving an option to get rid of it like the older gens. So now everytime this phone has a issue with the port I can't charge my phone when I need to because the port assumes there's water in it eveytime it's a hot summer day, or when I wash my hands it triggers it. At the end result I hate this phone with an passion and wish this phone never existed cause it's waste of time, and space. I rather go back to my Samsung S9!!!Re Edit: Now the phone won't actually work anymore due to the battery not wanting to charge so thank you for giving me a dud for a phone.
