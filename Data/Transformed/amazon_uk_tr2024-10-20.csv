So, after a lot of reading regarding reviews etc. I decided to go for another Motorola  -  the G34 5G. in the hopes that it would be more efficient and useful feature wise than my old e5 Play.Best move I made  -  this phone is packed with features I never new existed, is so logical and easy to navigate. The touch screen is super sensitive, responds immediately, and moving from one function to another is very fast. Nice bright screen, colours are very rich, and text is very clear. Sound is loud enough in my opinion, and does not have a ""tinny"" tone.  love the larger keypad on this  -  always had a problem with the much  smaller one on the old e5 Play, so only ever used it when I had to. It is now a pleasure to send texts, and all so simple and easy.Phone was very quick and simple to set up (once all the usual Google claptrap was out of the way) All very idiot proof. Imported all my data re emails, contacts etc. without having to do anything  -  all quite idiot proof really.Connected to my wifi at once. The only issue I had was trying to find out where the sim card tray was!! Could not see where there was a slot anywhere on the side of the phone that  was indicated on the instruction sheet. After almost giving up and putting  it back in the box, I realised there was a clear gel cover on the back which was hiding the location of the sim tray  (hello!!) Bit fiddly getting the nano card in, but once it was done, it was all just ready to go.I have had it for about two weeks now, and have monitored the battery life  -  it is very good. Leaving it switched on all day until late evening, with average useage, I have only had to recharge it 3 times as yet. I had to get a plug adapter (comes with a 2  pin plug on the usb lead. It does a rapid charge in approx 40 mins to fully charge from around 30%.Cameras work well - takes really clear pics with good colour. Video with sound works well too. Macro feature is very good, and useful that is has a qr scanner too. Had to download an app for that on the other phone. Easy to hold and not heavy or cumbersome.I never seemed to form a relationship with my old phone - always treated it as a necessary evil really and preferred my pay as you go Doro phone. However, with this phone I can honestly say I really love it and wish I had made the move a few yeas ago. I enjoy using this phone, it does not cause me any  hassle, responds quickly and efficiently to commands, and is just so great in every way. For what is considered as a budget phone, it does all I need it to and more, so why pay hundreds of pounds for a ""non budget"" phone. I consider this phone an absolute bargain at this  price for what you are getting.Cannot comment on face/fingerprint recognition because I have not got those features  set up. I did change the clock icon on the hoe screen because it was so big!! Downloaded K-9 email app (Mozilla thunderbird) and it configured and set up my email quickly, and works just great.  I do not like or use gmail.I would highly recommend this  to anyone wanting a  decent phone without the high price tag  -  ideal for a youngster\'s first phone even. Well done Moto. Very happy customer.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'dead account', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Happy and satisfied', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Received my new moto g34 (blue version sold by amazon) today. Straight out of the box it works with UK's new switch-off voLTE standard (4g calling with 5g data). The only thing is I found someone's photo on my phone. The photo was taken on 15th October 2023, 2 months before moto g34 was available for sale in the UK, so I can only assume a worker at the factory accidentally snapped a photo during testing. Other than that I'm very happy with the phone.

I was even going to return it after it came. But after using it for a few hours, I was so blown away by how good this phone was, I\'m keeping it!First of all, the amount of stuff this phone comes with is CRAZY! I have an iPhone 15 Pro and the only thing that came with was a usb c cable! This comes with:- A case- A pre-installed screen protector- 67W Charging brick and cable- EarphonesI kept having to remind myself this was only £189! To come with so much stuff is insanely generous!The device itself is gorgeous. I got it in blue and I absolutely love the design; the two tone back is very smart, and despite being plastic, feels like glass. The cameras are quite large too and help add to its premium look.The phone itself is incredibly light; it\'s lighter than my smaller iPhone 15 Pro! This is mostly because of its plastic build, but it doesn\'t feel cheap at all.The display is gorgeous. It\'s a 6.7"" AMOLED panel surrounded by very thin bezels. The punch hole camera is unobtrusive, and the panel itself has very punchy colours and looks sharp - I think the resolution is only 1080p but it\'s very crisp.The speakers are decent, with sound coming out of the top and bottom. Imo it\'s one of the weakest areas of the phone, but despite that, they still sound good.Speaking of sound, the headphone jack is a welcome addition; the included earphones are ok for freebies. The design of them is nice, but if you turn off Dolby Atmos enhanced sound, they are tinny and lifeless. Keep Dolby Atmos enabled with these buds!My Poco has 512GB storage, so I don\'t feel the need to use a micro SD card, of which this phone supports up to 1TB I believe.This isnt my first time using Android, but it is my first time using MIUI. After a few days of use, I find it has less features and customisability than Samsung phones, but it\'s skin is reminiscent of iOS, which may make the transition for newbies easier. There was a lot of bloat preinstalled on this phone, but it was easily uninstalled. I did start to get adverts too, but after installing adblock, they\'ve gone and not come back.There were a lot of system updates to install as well, all the way to Poco\'s latest HyperOS. I\'m not sure what\'s different between this and MIUI, they\'re mostly the same.I haven\'t used the phone enough to comment on battery life, but I love that the phone came with a 67W charger that can charge this phone INSANELY fast!!!Performance of the Poco M6 Pro is very impressive. I\'m not the heaviest of users; I don\'t game or do any editing. But I do browse Reddit, listen to a lot of music and watch YouTube. While there are some hiccups, the performance of this phone is so good in day to day that you\'ll have to remind yourself that this is supposed to be a budget phone!The only area that lets this phone down is the cameras. Photos are not great in the best of light, and completely fall apart in low light. I haven\'t recorded any video on it, but it doesn\'t even do 4K. I guess if they put good cameras on this, it would be too good and thered be no point in buying their other phones lol.Despite that, I\'m happily surprised by the Poco M6 Pro. Being so cheap, I had low expectations for this phone, but Poco have exceeded my expectations in every single category. Using this phone is an absolute joy, one which I don\'t plan on giving up any time soon.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Waseem Ahmed', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Quality at a great price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2024', 'Review Body': ""Great handset, really good value.

Brightness is also not bad. Although auto-brightness needs calibrating: you have to manually increase it few times if the screen is too dark. and it learns.It is very fast, as expected from most of the phones nowadays. I havent tested it for gaming though.Battery life has two sides. If the phone is idle, it spends very low energy. On the other hand, when the phone is loaded, it drains faster than some other phones I used.I thought I wouldnt like the MIUI but it was surprisingly refined and easy to use. I didnt see any ads around either. I can say the MIUI is almost as good as stock Android.It comes with a case but I didnt like it too much because it leaves half of the back uncovered, and it has a big lip so it makes it harder to hold the phone. I bought a third party case and it is much better, covers the whole back and snugs the cameras.The other thing I didnt like the phone is its flat shape. It is like a brick, similar to iPhones which I dislike a lot.

Coming from a Samsung device, it took me a little time to get used to the UI, but once I got familiar, the phone became very easy to use. It’s packed with features and feels premium without the hefty price tag.The camera quality is outstanding, especially for this price range—crisp, clear shots in all lighting conditions. The battery life is another highlight. With moderate to heavy usage (watching videos, playing games, browsing the web), the phone lasts me from 5 AM until midnight without needing a recharge. And when it does need charging, the 120W charger is a game changer. I can fully charge the phone in just about 40 minutes, and it can boost to 50% in less than 15 minutes, which is incredibly convenient.Storage-wise, the Redmi Note 13 Pro offers ample space. With 512GB, I’ve had no issues with running out of space for my apps, photos, and videos. It’s fast, and transferring data is a breeze.The audio quality is another area where the phone shines. The stereo speakers provide clear and rich sound, making videos and music enjoyable. Even without headphones, the sound output is loud and crisp, with minimal distortion at higher volumes.In terms of performance, it handles everything smoothly, from multitasking to gaming. I also appreciate the screen quality and overall design—it’s a beautiful phone that doesn’t feel bulky. I definitely find this phone superior in terms of battery and camera performance.Overall, this phone is an excellent purchase, especially considering the price. It feels like a flagship without the flagship price. Highly recommended!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Skinky', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best value for money phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""I have had Xiaomi phones for years so I'm used to them and have always found them to be great value for money. Recently their flagship equivalents have become almost as expensive as the leaders so I've had to look for a more affordable option. This phone seems to hit the sweet spot. A very capable phone who's biggest selling point is it's battery and charging. 120w charging allows 0% to 100% charge in 20 mins. And lasts all day with heavy use. Which means in practical terms I never have to schedule charging. Just plug it in a few minutes while I get ready to go out and it's done. The only feature I really wish it had is wireless charging if only to save the USB connector wear. But that's probably the only compromise here. Decent cameras, fast processor, good storage. Great screen brightness and colour though I'm not as fond of the curved screen as I thought I might be. I play a game which fills the screen and occasionally looks a little distorted by the curves at the edge. Not a big problem and it doesn't seem to caused inadvertent touch issues but I would go for a flat screen next time. Set-up was very smooth and quick, copying all my stuff off the old phone. I only wish that my app layout was replicated too. And all the apps didn't need to then be reactivated. But that's maybe just asking too much. I would definitely recommend this phone to family and friends.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'David Daly', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'My Partner and Her New Best Friend – The Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2024', 'Review Body': ""I got the Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G for my partner, and she’s absolutely over the moon with it.

My last phone for several years was the very expensive Samsung flagship, the Galaxy Note 9. Before that was the S7 edge. This principle of buying products to last has usually served me well. My Note 9 recently developed a bad case of random resets of increasing frequency and, it being about 5 years old, I figured it was time to look around for something newer.I wasn\'t necessarily looking for a budget phone, price was NOT the deciding factor in my purchase.Rather I was looking at available functionality... those aspects of a phone that I like and want to repeat in my next one, versus those aspects I\'m not so bothered about.To look first at those issues which are common to all phones... the display on this is 6.5 inches pOLED, 1080 x 2400 pixels, up to 120 Hz refresh rate and up to 1300 nits brightness. Has a top central punch hole for the front camera. It\'s bright and vibrant, premium quality and is bright enough to use outside with zero problems on a sunny day. A premium display... every bit as good as the display on my previous Galaxy Note 9.The amount of bexel is perfect. Any less bezel and it would run the risk of your fingers and thumb that are holding the phone triggering unwanted response.I really, really like NOT having a curved, Samsung \'edge\' type display. I always thought it was a useless gimmick and it\'s great to have a flat display again after 8 years.There is no mention of Gorilla Glass on this handset. Motorola/Lenovo support have stated publicly in a discussion forum that this phone has a toughened glass display which is equivalent to Gorilla Glass.  Make of that what you will.  This, by the way, is much the same situation for most, if not all, mid-range and budget handsets around this price range.This phone has IP54 dust and splash resistance.  Don\'t take it in the shower or drop it in a puddle, and be careful on the beach.The weight of this handset is wonderful too after the heavy Note 9. It\'s physically smaller, lighter, and thinner than the Note 9 despite having a slightly larger display with higher refresh rate.The speakers are clear and loud enough. They, surprisingly, give a decent stereo image... oddly enough better than I got on my Note 9. They don\'t have much bass, even less than the Note 9 had.  They are a bit tinny sounding to be honest, but they are perfectly ok for handsfree speech or just a stream of radio music for the background. For proper music listening or watching long video content you\'ll probably want to connect to a speaker dock or use headphones if you want more bass.Speed wise the G84 5G uses the Qualcomm SM6375 Snapdragon 695 5G (6 nm) SOC/CPU. Octa-core (2x2.2 GHz Kryo 660 Gold & 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 660 Silver) with Adreno 619 Graphics Processor. It\'s not a flagship SOC. It\'s an older, mid-range chipset, but having said that, it\'s no slouch either and is still being fitted in mid range handsets from a numbers of manufacturers being released as recently as just last month (such as the OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G).You might need to drop the resolution down a bit if you demand to play ultra high resolution graphics MMOs, but for the vast majority of users its absolutely quick enough for everything you\'re likely to throw its way, plus being a bit slower than CPUs in the latest £1,000+ handsets means it uses less battery.... and talking of which, the fixed 5000 MAH Lithium Polymer is good for up to two days\' fairly solid use.  It takes a \'turbo\' charge of up to 30W too, which is plenty enough to charge the phone very quickly.  It comes with a 30W mains fast charger with a UK 3-pin plug.Personally I disapprove of fast/turbo charging as it kills batteries. It\'s much better, if you have the time, to slow charge at a lower wattage.  It means the battery will last longer.  There is NO option in settings to select to slow charge so if you don\'t want to Turbo charge and cook your battery then you will need to use a lower powered mains charger - and your battery will probably last a year longer if you do that.There is no built in wireless charging.  As someone who has wirelessly charged my last two handsets for around 8 years this was a bit of a pain to be honest.  However I picked up one of those USB-C type QI charging receivers for a few £\'s and fitted it inside the silicone case I\'m using and it\'s perfect.I use an app called Wi-Fi File Explorer Pro (from the Amazon App Store) (but there are plenty of similar apps) to handle transfers of stuff between handset and pc and it\'s almost as quick as cable and it saves having to remove the QI receiver.I slow charge overnight using wireless charging using an old 0.85A Blackberry charger.  Takes a few hours but it doesn\'t get hot so it\'s kind on the battery.Motorola/Lenovo don\'t bloat up your handset with software junk.  It\'s quite a novelty after having had a couple of Samsung phones with extreme bloatware overload.  Motorola\'s skin is practically vanilla android, which is nice.  The couple of extra apps they do include you can even actually uninstall, not just disable.  Almost immediately on purchase I got the option to update to Android 14 which I have done.A word of warning about android 14.... if you have any OLD apps which you like and use all the time (whether it\'s an old pre-malware version of ES File Explorer or pre-malware version of Quickpic, or Timeriffic, CalendarPad, Alreader or whatever... install them, side-load them if you must, BEFORE updating to Android 14. Android 14 is much more aggressive about sideloading and the use of old apps than Android 13 is, and it will block you from doing so. You can use ADB from a PC to get around it, but it\'s a hassle.This handset has NFC which can be used, among other things, for making payments in stores instead of having to use a bank card. Many competing handsets in this price range, and higher, do not include an NFC chip.  Sure it\'s not much used in Asia but it IS heavily used in Europe, so the kindest way to describe Asia-based manufacturers who don\'t include NFC in the handsets they release in Europe is that they are not paying attention.This phone includes Bluetooth 5.1, A2DP, LE.  It recognised my AptX receiver and activated AptX just fine.Camera... probably the most criticised part of this handset... but still absolutely fine. The 50 megapixel description is rather misleading in my opinion. I spoke about this with Motorola support and the camera app uses ""ultrapixels"" like my old HTC One M8 did.  The camera on the One M8 was pretty meh to be honest but this has been considerably better.  When using the camera app you will usually get a photo result of 12.53 megapixels size - this is because the software uses 4 input pixels to one output pixel, to average and take the best result.  Only by going into \'pro\' mode in the camera app will you actually be able to manually select to use the full 50 megapixel resolution.  The Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) seems to do a decent job and is good to have.I found the camera rather slow in operation compared to the 12.1MP native resolution camera on my old Note 9 and the image quality is roughly comparable.  It\'s not better than the Note 9\'s camera but I wouldn\'t say it\'s especially worse either, just different.  It consistently produces a colder image than the Note 9, in a different size ratio and at a different focal length.  It\'s perfectly acceptable.Dark environments is always the challenge of camera sensors and I would say that this camera holds it\'s ground very firmly against the Note 9\'s camera.  I did a number of tests and have no complaints.There is the option to use the excellent, free, OpenCamera app from the Play Store too for a different \'take\' on a camera app (pun unintended).The launcher on this handset is pretty good imo, but I\'ve used Nova Launcher Prime for so long, I just transferred my settings for that from my old handset.  If you wish to just use the stock launcher I think you will be quite happy.One downside which has been picked up on by reviewers is that Motorola only guaranteed one Android version level update, to Android 14, which has now been released, but tech magazines have stated their expectation that this handset will get Android 15, plus any necessary security updates, for 3 years.I went for the midnight blue, 12GB Ram 256GB storage version.  This comes with a clear silicone case - the type that usually turns brown after a few months, but it\'s enough to last until you get a case you like better.  I bought a blue carbon-fibre style silicone case ( ASIN B0D14B4YY8 ) which is great and fits perfectly, and tempered glass screen protector (which doesn\'t fit very well - too narrow).Now two issues which some people find contentious...I had a 512GB microSD card in my Note 9 and transferred it across to this handset. I have access to Google\'s YouTube Music premium streaming service but at a compressed, lossy 256kbps it\'s still not as good in terms either of convenience nor terms of audio quality as having locally saved music.  Locally saved music at 320kbps MP3 or FLAC is something I use much more than any streaming service, so this handset having the ability to fit an MicroSD, SDHC and SDHX card is very important.  The specifications don\'t state the maximum size micro SDHX it will accept but it could theoretically be as high as 2TB.It\'s something that all manufacturers COULD do without there being any validity to claims about increasing thickness or reduction of waterproofing.  I believe that the reason so many manufacturers have dropped microSD storage is so they can charge you more money for handsets with more storage and sell streaming service monthly subscriptions.I\'m something of an amateur musician, I play synths and pipe organ. My musical taste is extensive and varied and I use my phone to listen to a lot of music, mostly on a pair of wired Sennheiser Momentum 1.0 on-ear headphones so a headphone jack is pretty darned important. The headphone output on this handset is 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio. It\'s superb.I have a couple of high quality wireless headsets... they\'re great for gaming and I use them all the time but they simply do not deliver the level of detail/quality that I am used to from my music, plus there\'s all the mucking about with charging them and electrostatic interference from nearby electrical devices.  Sure, I just happen to have a spare SoundBlaster G3 compact USB-C DAC and headphone amp knocking about which I could use to plug in some high end headphones if I wanted to. I even have a compact AptX capable bluetooth receiver which I could use to power wired heaphones instead, so......even though it wouldn\'t cost me so much as a single penny if I were forced to give up the heaphone jack, there\'s one thing that Apple, Samsung and Google et al who have stormed off boldly down this path of functionality removal don\'t care about.... every single alternative to the phone having an actual headphone jack involves the user having to make sacrifices, involves the user having to make compromises in order to ""gain"" something THEY are telling you that you have to want.I don\'t need someone telling me what I want. I am perfectly capable of seeing for myself that removal of basic functionality in order to force users to compromise is not an advantage.I like being able to just plug in a pair of high quality headphones. No mucking about with chargers, no adaptors, no hassle, no sacrifice. No compromise.One unusual feature this handset includes which I\'ve not had on a phone in many years is a built in FM receiver.  It uses the headphones\' cable as an antenna and is absolutely superb; crystal clear and with no hiss when using my Sennheiser Momentum.  It is possible to use it without headphones plugged in, although the reception quality will almost certainly take a hit. The included FM receiver app is simple and easy to use. Very easy to scan and save your favourite stations.The under-screen fingerprint sensor is blisteringly fast and reliable, even when I\'m using the tempered glass screen protector.So, to summarise, after coming from an expensive, top of the range, flagship Samsung Note device from a few years ago I have to say I\'m extremely pleased with this phone. Add a screen protector and a QI charging receiver inside a silicone case and it does everything I want, very well indeed and at a phenomenally good price.There are similiarly priced handsets from the likes of OnePlus, Xioami/Redmi, Nothing/CMF, TCL, Nokia and even Samsung but a lot of them are more expensive with less functionality, slower MediaTek SOCs, missing NFC, missing headphone jack/microSD storage, bloatier UI etc.If you\'re looking for a new handset, regardless of the price range you\'re considering, then it\'s worth thinking about what parts of a smartphone functionality you want / must have and choosing accordingly.I would have happily bought a flagship phone to get all the functionality I want, but this time around I was forced to buy something much cheaper because it is only at the budget end of the market that manufacturers are paying attention to what customers actually want from their phones.At the current sale price of £179 this is a complete and utter bargain and frankly, blows all the competition out of the water imo.I\'ve included a couple of pictures taken by the phone too so you can see how the camera is absolutely fine, a couple in very low light - the night time one with the clock radio was taken by the light of a 3W LED bedside lamp within a lamp shade, plus a couple taken in daylight (although it\'s summer time in Scotland so it really should be called grey light), also a picture of the USB-C QI wireless charging receiver I\'m using which works perfectly - taken by my Note 9, as was the picture with it inside the blue silicone case.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Madeleine Scott Cree', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'An all-round decent smartphone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""So my past five phones have all been Motorolas.

Files/games when setting the phone up for the first time. [Since updates I haven't had any overheating doing light stuff but maybe that's due to the the heatwave going away].When this does happen everything on the NORD is extremely slow. The volume buttons take 1-1.5 secs to rejester a long press. The screen goes way below 60hzs. Also the 30w warp charging has so far from my experience has just been as fast as my 15w S10+. Taken a good 40mins to get to 50. Not what I expected for 30w charging? This has now been fixed due to sofware or the the heatwave. updates However apart from this when web browsing and watching movies etc. It's a good option for the average person. Also this NORD phone can game but just so you know that it will probably over heat so when this happens the phone screen will dim down a little bit. When I mean it over heats I mean that I will get a notification saying on the line off the phone is too hot and some stuff will be restricted till the phone cools down. As I use my phone as a WiFi modem all the time for personal hotspot the NORD hoverheats slot of the time especially on a hot day at around 27c+. again probs due to th heat wave UK had 31c plus for a week when i was doing my testing.  Hopefully this helps you out. Also i've noticed that at my work I don't have very little service and i'm on EE network. I'm unfortunately unable to play music sometimes or call on the OnePlus NORD. So i put the sim card in my S10+ and i could call, text, and load facebook and sometimes youtube with only a little delay. that makes me believe that the NORD over estimates the service it has evern though its a 5g phone. my sim is 4g.  I did my test running YouTube from 100% to 0% on 50% brightness and 50% volume i got an accurate time of around 14h 57mins.  30W charging most days gets a full charge in 1hr. so I advise NOT plugging it in overnight with the 30W charger. Plug it in with a 5W cable and 5W wall plug if you charge over night. What i do is wake up in the morning and just do all the stuff i need to do then before you know it its on 75%.

The 13MP rear camera and 5MP front camera do a decent job, featuring modes like Panorama, Night, and HDR to help you snap some great pics.The 4300mAh battery is impressive, lasting 1-2 days on a single charge, and the dual SIM option is a nice touch for those who need it.

I wanted him to be able to stay in touch with me in case he got lost or delayed, without all the smartphone features that are so potentially addictive and dangerous for kids. This one seemed perfect and the price point even more so! If it gets lost it\'s not such an issue (bearing in mind phones and devices are more likely to get lost with absent minded kids).All in all it\'s a great value brick phone; the turquoise colour is good for not getting lost and being visible in the depths of your back, and it\'s small and light enough to fit in your bag or pocket without weighing you down (or your kid\'s already heavy school bag).The interface is fine; most of us probably remember it from our pre-smartphone days. There\'s the classic game ""Snake"" to pass the time when bored on the bus, and you can text and so on. Obviously there\'s no internet but I didn\'t want that for my child.One small annoyance: there are a few other basic games like Tetris but you have to pay to get the full game, which I thought was a bit of a rip off!This is a bit of an idiot-proof device for anyone who is a technophobe - and easy to learn. All in all good value and a decent option for anyone looking to stay smartphone free for longer - or to purchase a basic phone that won\'t break easily, won\'t matter if it gets lost and won\'t get your child addicted to the internet and apps.

So mostly I need for phone, sms and camera (plus Whatsapp).On the one hand it does all those quite well - though I find the camera pales in comparison to my daughter's (quite old) iphone.  But I find it very 'laggy' compared to other phones. And was disappointed to see that the 'dual SIM' works BUT by preventing you using that slot for an SD card.  (My previous Nokia has a slot that took 2 micro SIM as well as an SD card - this only takes either one SIM and an SD or two SIMs). As someone that must have 2 SIMS and that wanted extra memory - that has been massive disapppointement.Saying that - there are a few things that improved my experience compared to my last Nokia.

The performance is a bit slow but kind of what you'd expect at this price point, but as others have mentioned, there is a couple of annoying issues that hopefully might get sorted with an update, one is the screen constantly keeps turning on with the slightest of movement, which doesn't help the battery and the other is the WiFi connection is very poor, but overall it's a fairly pleasant phone for the money. Oh and one other thing, as others have also mentioned, you don't seem to get monthly security updates, I don't mind really, but Nokia shouldn't advertise that if they don't deliver! .Edit 19th November 2023My Nokia G22 has been demoted to a spair phone, it's far to unreliable for a daily driver.

It's hard to find anything that matches what's on offer here in this price range, especially in the UK. The phone arrived in a compact box with a usb c charging lead but no charging adapter, which is fine, most of us already have a suitable one. The UK versions don't come with a case either, so it's really just the phone and the cable in the box. The phone looks nice, especially the vegan leather back option offers something different than every other phone. The frame is made of plastic and the front is glass of course. It's a solid built and it's comfortable holding it. I have to say these specs are amazing, the 8gb of ram is plenty and the 256gb storage matches many top of the range phones so it's certainly nice to have in a sub £200 phone. On top of this you can use a micro sd card up to a whopping 1tb if you want to. The specs are impressing in other areas too, like the screen which has 1080p+ resolution and 90Hz refresh rate - again a rare thing for this much money. I ran some synthetic benchmarks and I was quite surprised to see that the moto g54 matches the performance of flagship phones from 2020 which is impressive to say the least. Where it fell behind was the gpu tests where it wasn't as powerful, so that's bad news for serious gamers, but casual gamers should be ok. The phone comes with android 13 out of the box and the upgrade to android 14 is guaranteed, however no more major android versions after that. The phone will get security updates until September 2026 based on motorola's official site. It's promised to be bi-monthly security updates, but that's not quite true...the g54 came out in September 2023 and the latest security update available at the time of writing (May 2024) is of Dec 2023. So it's not perfect, but it's not worse than competitors in this price segment. The camera is a pretty important feature for almost everybody and my experience is that the phone can take decent photos, but they look quite processed. The photos are sharp, but in an artificial way. For me this is not a problem as I only use it as a work phone to take photos of jobs done and for that it's perfect, but it doesn't take natural looking nice photos as more expensive phones can. Performance is great in real life, although I didn't install many apps on mine. I only ever notice some stuttering when launching the camera, or gallery, but after a few seconds this stuttering disappears and the phone is good to go. Unfortunately there were some bloatware preinstalled on the phone but luckily all of them are removable. There is some degree of splash resistance but no official IP rating, it's still better than nothing. The battery is huge, 5000mAh, again a flagship worthy number, and it last days for me with very light use. Even with heavier usage, it should get anybody through a day I think. Charging is not very fast, but I don't mind to live with some compromises to get a cheap phone. I think motorola struck the perfect balance with cutting corners and offering a low price with the g54. You get an excellent screen that is on par with £500+ phones, enough RAM and plenty of storage. Big battery and good performance compliments the package. What is sacrificed is more major android upgrades, and the speed at which security updates arrive. The camera is decent for the money but won't be for everyone. Charging is slow too. All in all it's a really good value for money phone and I can only recommend it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'gra w', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'SIMS', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent product, good value.

I need my phone to be secure, so as this Moto g54 5g was Motorola's latest release at the time I bought it (released Sept. 2023 and bought Jan. 2024). It has great specs, and you get a lot for your money, £179.95 and down to £159.95 on January sale offer. It compares perfornance well with my son's Google Pixel 7a, which cost £370. The only major pro and con between the phones is that the Google Pixel 7a came with android 14, and the Moto g54 has android 13. I expected this to upgrade to 14, as that is this year's android release, but it hasn't upgraded yet, but Motorola say It will be soon. It does state that the g54 gets at least 2 major upgrades and 3 years security updates and support. So I'm hoping this does update soon. The Pixel 7a gets 4 years+ support, but Google phones always get their software updates before other manufacturers. While I'm on the subject of software, Motorola seem to have discontinued the excellent Motorola Migrate app for some reason. There's not much of an instruction book to show you how to transfer your apps and data. I quickly googled how to do it by a usbC to usbC cable, data, files and app transfer, but a pre installed app or clearer instructions would have been helpful. Apart from that, the Moto g54 is good, fast and responsive. I'm not sure the camera is any better than the one on my old Moto g10, and has lost its super wide angle lens. However, if I want to take great pictures I will use my camera instead. The phone camera is perfect for snapping unplanned photos.The supplied 15 watt charger is an improvement over my old phone, and gets enough charge in fast (10 minutes from 10% to about 30%) when the battery is low and you're in a hurryOverall, the Moto g54 5g is a great phone, at an unbeatable value price. There's not really any other phones from reliable manufacturers that offer the same specs in the same price range, apart from other Motorola phone models.

Aquí están mis impresiones:Cámara:La cámara trasera Sony de 50 MP con tecnología Ultra XDR es fantástica. Las fotos salen muy nítidas, con una excelente reproducción de colores y detalles, incluso en condiciones de poca luz. El modo retrato destaca, logrando un buen enfoque del sujeto y un desenfoque de fondo natural. Los vídeos también son muy estables y tienen una buena resolución.Batería y rendimiento:La duración de la batería es sobresaliente. Con un uso moderado (redes sociales, fotos, y algo de streaming), me dura más de un día sin necesidad de cargarlo. Además, la optimización de batería es excelente, ya que el teléfono sabe cómo gestionar el consumo energético cuando está en reposo o en aplicaciones que no requieren mucha potencia. Para quien busca un smartphone que aguante el día sin problemas, este es una muy buena opción.Rendimiento general:El procesador es rápido y eficiente, manejando aplicaciones pesadas y multitarea sin problemas. Los 8 GB de RAM aseguran una experiencia fluida, sin tirones ni ralentizaciones. El sistema operativo también está bien optimizado, lo que se nota en el tiempo de respuesta y la fluidez de la interfaz.Almacenamiento:Los 128 GB de almacenamiento son más que suficientes para la mayoría de usuarios. Si sueles guardar muchas fotos, vídeos o aplicaciones pesadas, no tendrás que preocuparte por quedarte sin espacio pronto.Pantalla:La pantalla tiene una excelente calidad, con colores vibrantes y buena visibilidad incluso bajo luz solar directa. Aunque no tiene las especificaciones de las pantallas OLED de gama alta, el panel sigue siendo impresionante para su rango de precio.Contras:El único inconveniente que he encontrado es la falta de NFC para realizar pagos con tarjeta. Hoy en día, esta es una función que muchos smartphones de gama media y alta incluyen, por lo que puede ser un factor decisivo para algunos usuarios. También es importante señalar que no tiene una certificación IP formal, así que cuidado con el agua y el polvo.Conclusión:En general, el CMF Phone 1 es un gran teléfono en términos de rendimiento, cámara y duración de batería.

Charges pretty quick too if you pick up a fast charger.Performance is decent, the mediatek chip is 5g capable and handles most things with ease, but will struggle a bit with intense tasks.Cons:Now while not necessarily a con, the software skin MagicOS might not be for everyone, but it’s very customisable and can work seamlessly with other Honor devices.The main camera is pretty good in daylight, but struggles a bit in lower light. The ultrawide is the main issue, only 5MP so detail is pretty poor, and the selfie camera is good.Overall it’s a really good phone and if you’re not too worried about best in class cameras and high end performance, this’ll be a great phone for you!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stuart Nelmes', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'Brilliant quality phone for a very good price (£199)Plenty of storage space.

The colors are vibrant, and it has a sleek, premium design that feels good in the hand. The anti-drop feature is also reassuring.Decent Battery Life: The battery lasts well enough for everyday use, and the 256GB of storage is plenty to hold apps, photos, and videos without any issues.Affordable Price: For a budget-friendly 5G phone, it delivers in terms of basic functionality and overall look. If you\'re looking for a phone that offers good value for money, it ticks that box.Cons:Lack of App Availability: Surprisingly, some key apps like Instagram are not available to download from the Google Play Store. This was a major inconvenience, as it restricts access to popular apps that are a must for many users.Camera Limitations: The rear camera may boast 108MP, but it only records in 1080p. Unless you hold the phone very steadily, the video quality isn\'t great. The front 50MP camera was another disappointment, producing underwhelming selfies that didn’t meet my expectations.Slow Charging: Charging takes around 3 hours, which is much slower than many other phones in this price range. If you’re someone who’s always on the go, this could be frustrating.Software Permissions: The phone frequently asks for multiple permissions—more than I’m comfortable giving. Certain apps, such as those requiring location or call log access, won’t work without granting permissions that don’t seem necessary for their function.Subpar Speaker Quality: The sound quality from the speakers feels cheap. The audio lacks crispness and bass, so watching videos or listening to music isn’t the best experience.Game Performance: Some games don’t run in full-screen mode, leaving black bars around the display. This really detracts from the overall experience, and the software feels like it needs significant improvement in this area.Final Thoughts:The HONOR 200 Lite looks great, and for £200, it’s tempting. However, the lack of essential features, limited app availability, slow charging, and poor camera performance made it hard to keep. If you\'re okay with the trade-offs, it might be worth it, but for me, these issues outweighed the positives.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Carla Alaia', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 3 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Dato che stavo cercando un telefono che facesse delle buone foto ma ad un prezzo ragionevole.

The vastly improved specifications is a huge leap forward compare to the 9  Lite with only 3gb RAM, 32gb Storage, a 3000mah battery, and a 13 MP main camera.  Thanks to the the main stars which are the generous 8gb RAM and the whopping 256gb storage, this phone is extremely snappy and a pleasure to operate.  The 100MP main camera takes brilliant photos, while the larger screen and the ultra thin bezel deliver a much improved visual experience.With the unique Honor app DEVICE CLONE, I was able to transfer all datas ( including all my downloaded APPS) from the old HONOR to the new HONOR effortlessly using a C to C cable ( an adaptor is needed on the old phone as it is a micro USB).  The only APP that I had to apply more work is WHATSAPP, as I wanted all my contacts and chat history to be transferred as well.There are some drawbacks including lack of 3.5 jack, no internal memory card slot, lower screen brightness, and the screen is LCD and not AMOLED.  However, I can accept the minor compromise as I don’t feel like paying £100 more for these features found in the Redmi Note 13 5G with similar camera size, memory and storage capacity.As technology changes so rapidly theses days, the relatively affordable price of this reliable Chinese phone means that I can upgrade to newer technology more often without feeling guilty.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Shane', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The glassy finish is very slippery', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2023', 'Review Body': 'Excellent little phone!

It’s not designed for power users.Build Quality: The plastic back feels a little cheap, and I recommend getting a case for extra protection.No 5G Support: If you’re looking for the latest connectivity, note that this phone only supports 4G.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A15 offers solid value for money, especially if you’re after a phone for basic tasks, a good camera, and excellent battery life. It’s perfect for users on a budget or those who don’t need top-tier performance.

Maybe its not as solid as it has a plastic back, no indication of if its waterproof or what the glass screen is made of but since I take care of my devices this is not a problem.  And I don't want or need anything that includes AI!This is a UK version of the phone and while there are other cheaper offerings available they are not always for use in the UK.It runs Android 14 and supposedly will get three updates over its life.The screen is crystal clear and the fingerprint reader on the side is very response and quick.Good battery life and will go into Superfast Charging mode with a suitable charger.  You don't get one with it, just the cable but I have plenty of chargers.  To be honest I have tons of cables as well and it wouldn't bother me if it didn't come with one of those either.Comes with the usual Samsung and Google bloatware which I removed straight away.  Rather than transfer all my apps from the old phone I started installing them from fresh.  Just personal data was transfered over.  Didn't bother with a Samsung Account.The speaker is far better than my old phone even if it is mono.The only thing I've found that was a trifle disappointing was that the camera doesn't support Raw mode which I prefer.  However, its mostly for snapshots so no big deal and the images it captures are just fine.If you want a budget priced phone then this is one I'd recommend.  According to the listing its supposed to have a 3 Year Extended warranty but there seemed to be no evidence of this when I came to register it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Andrey', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Disappointing Performance Despite Attractive Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2024', 'Review Body': 'On paper, the Samsung Galaxy A15 looks like great value, but it’s incredibly slow.

With the swagger of a pirate and the charm of a court jester, the OnePlus 12 pirouettes onto the scene, ready to tickle your funny bone and dazzle your senses.Design:Picture this: the OnePlus 12, decked out in Flowy Emerald attire, strutting down the catwalk like a supermodel on roller skates. At 164.3mm tall, 75.8mm wide, and 9.15mm thick, it's not just a phone; it's a fashion statement, darling! And at 220g, it's as hefty as a medieval goblet, but twice as shiny.Display:Hold onto your hats, folks! The OnePlus 12 boasts a 6.82-inch ProXDR Display, capable of turning heads faster than a double-take at a magic show. With a refresh rate that goes from a leisurely 1Hz to a hyperactive 120Hz, it's like watching a sloth race against a cheetah, but with more pixels and less sweat.Performance:With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform at its core and up to 16GB of RAM, the OnePlus 12 is faster than a caffeinated ferret on a sugar rush. Whether you're juggling flaming torches or multitasking like a boss, this phone can handle it all with the finesse of a tightrope walker at a clown convention.Camera:Say cheese! The OnePlus 12 comes equipped with a trio of lenses that would make any paparazzi blush with envy. From the wide-angle lens for capturing epic panoramas to the periscope telephoto lens for spying on your neighbor's cat (just kidding, don't do that), the OnePlus 12's camera system is more versatile than a Swiss army knife at a picnic.Battery and Charging:Never fear, intrepid adventurer, for the OnePlus 12 comes with a battery that's as hearty as a medieval feast. With 5400mAh of power and 100W SUPERVOOC charging, you'll never be stranded in the digital wilderness without a lifeline. So go forth and conquer, brave soul, for the OnePlus 12 has your back like a loyal squire.Software and Connectivity:OxygenOS 14.0, based on the legendary Android 14, ensures a user experience so smooth, it's like sliding down a rainbow on a unicorn's back (minus the horn in your side). And with 5G support, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and eSIM, you'll stay connected to the digital realm like a wizard with Wi-Fi spells.In conclusion, the OnePlus 12 is not just a smartphone; it's a sideshow spectacle, a technicolor dreamcoat, and a whirlwind adventure through the smartphone circus. So grab your popcorn, cue the circus music, and join the fun with the OnePlus 12. Because when it comes to laughter, lunacy, and ludicrously good smartphones, there's only one ringmaster in town: the OnePlus 12, where the circus never leaves town and the laughs never stop rolling.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Betty Palmer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Top class phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'Hard to fault this phone, it has everything!

After 6 years away, I'm finally home, and I ain't leaving again. The OnePlus 12 feels faster and smoother than ever before. It's got the biggest battery ever, it's super fast at charging, it's got a beautiful 1440p resolution, and it handles gaming easily. Record videos at 4K/60/8K/24. A duel vapor chamber.

I’ve gone two full days without plugging it in, which is perfect for long hikes or those marathon work sessions. Built to handle rough conditions, the Blade 10 is both tough and dependable. I’ve dropped it on rocks and exposed it to the elements, and it’s come through without a scratch. Thanks to its IP68/IP69K rating, it’s safe from water, dust, and shocks.The display works well for watching videos, but it could use a bit more brightness for outdoor settings. The cameras do a decent job of capturing moments, though they might not be as high-end as those on flagship models. The dual SIM slots are super handy for juggling work and personal calls on one device.All in all, the DOOGEE Blade 10 is more than just a smartphone; it’s a trusty partner that can tackle tough situations.

You can install all the apps in the Play store, and get the full Android experience with this device.- NFC for contactless payment (tap middle of the phone against reader). Seems to work well even from a small distance.- Battery life is excellent. Two days of normal use is totally doable.- Screen is good. Resolution is lower than more expensive phones, but only a few people might notice some graphics are less sharp than mid-range or flagship devices. Text displays fine.- Considering the price, performance is decent. I don\'t game on my phone, but switching between apps is fluid most of the time, albeit loading times are a little bit longer than more powerful phones. Most apps are snappy enough to use without issues.- Location, GPS make using this phone for navigation easy.- Bluetooth pairing works well for music and other services.- Wi-Fi connects without issues.- Fingerprint reader on the side works reasonably well, and allows you to use biometric features in apps.But with the great value comes some drawbacks.- Camera is not that great. If you are a keen photographer, skip this phone. Image quality and camera response is not good.- Video is again, average. I don\'t recommend this phone for shooting a lot of video.- Screen is not that bright in sunny conditions.- Speaker phone (which I use a lot) is quiet, and seems to cause issues with the microphone, so people struggle to hear me when I have them on speaker.- Updates introduce new bugs and slow performance (I think this is common with Android)- Motorola ""features"" like the famous karate chop to turn on the torch seems less reliable than my previous (more expensive) Moto.So despite the drawbacks, this phone has pretty much everything you would need day-to-day.

I was looking at the iPhone SE 2020, however the difference between using that and my iPhone 11 Pro Max is too much; I\'m too pro-big screen now!Enter the Samsung Galaxy A71; I first heard about this phone from a recommended YouTube video, and after also looking at the A51, I decided to spend the extra and get this. I\'m glad I did!I\'ll go over the positives, negatives and experience compared to my main phone, the iPhone 11 Pro Max.POSITIVES. Very light - this phone is incredibly light for the size! It\'s very comfortable to hold in one hand.. Build - a lot of people list plastic bodies as a negative, but I like the change from the typical slippery glass back.. Amazing screen - the screen on this phone is incredible! It\'s big at 6.7"", and while it may not be 1440p, I find it very sharp. Colours are amazing - it\'s set to ""Natural"" tuning out of the box, but I set it to be more saturated and I absolutely love it.. Battery - at time of review I\'ve had this phone for a few days so take this with a grain of salt, but battery life is great. Lasts throughout the day with no issues, could easily last half way through the next day as well.. Fast charging - phone completely charges from around 30% in under an hour, close to 40 minutes. Operating System - Samsung\'s skin has definitely changed for the better! Last Samsung I had was the S7 edge. Lots of modifications to make handling such a tall phone easier, and the phone feels fast after changing the animation times to be 0.5 times normal.. What\'s in the box - if I had just been given the phone and a normal charger I wouldn\'t have complained since the value would still be amazing, however it comes with a fast charger in the box and a pair of in ear earphones!. Storage - 128GB storage is insane. The 11 Pro Max starts at 64! It does have expandable storage also, but I haven\'t used it as 128 is enough for me.NEGATIVES. No wireless charging - I really like wireless charging, I use it to charge my iPhone every night. No idea why this is a feature reserved for flagships.. User experience - this is more on Samsung/Android than the phone itself, but it just doesn\'t feel as smooth as my 11 Pro max. Even with animations set to normal speeds, some animations just feel jarring. Samsung\'s UI could do with some more polish.. Software bloat - this phone comes with a lot of apps pre-installed, where they could just offer the Google version (e.g. the Photos app). Also it comes with Facebook pre installed which I absolutely hate. Luckily you can disable it! On the flip side, some really useful Samsung apps don\'t come pre installed, such as Good Lock and Samsung Pass.. Speaker - the speaker setup on this is dreadful. One bottom facing speaker which is easily blocked with one finger. Should have gone for a dial speaker setup which is the norm right now.. Camera - this phones camera isn\'t bad. I actually like the versatility of the camera setup. What I don\'t like it how terrble the pictures looked out of the box. It wasnt until using it a few times that I realised that it doesn\'t use the 64MP sensor by default - you have to change from 3:2 to 3:2 64MP camera mode, which I found really confusing.. Performance - while this phone performs perfectly fine for 80% of the time, the 20% of the time that it doesn\'t it noticeable. Freezing when I go into an app (typically happens in Chrome), taking a while to realise I\'ve turned the phone into horizontal mode. Also there seems to be a consistent bug where I\'ll stop getting notifications during the later half of the day, for no rhyme or reason. I have nothing set up stopping notifications from coming in. Restarting the phone fixes this issue, but even doing so made me realise that I\'ve never had to do that with my 11 Pro Max.VS THE 11 PRO MAXThis phone makes me feel stupid for buying the 11 Pro Max. There, I said it.. While using this phone, I honestly cannot justify spending over £1000 for the 11 Pro Max, or any other phone!. I prefer holding this phone since it\'s much lighter, less slippery and I feel a lot less anxious - dropping a £300 phone would worry me less than dropping the Pro Max!. The display is bigger and more colourful, I actually prefer the display on this phone over the one on the 11 Pro Max!. I miss wireless charging so much. I miss the simplicity of iOS. Android is nice, but iOS makes a lot more sense and has a much more pleasant user experience. I do appreciate being able to play Pokémon Emerald on this though.. The camera quality and experience is a lot better on the iPhone.. Battery life is better on the 11 Pro Max by about 25%SUMMARYI may have listed quite a few negatives on this phone, and comparing it to an iPhone 11 Pro Max may feel unfair, but I really like this phone and it more than holds its ground against the Apple flagship, I\'m honestly surprised that budget phones have come such a long way; it shows that mobile phones arent developing as rapidly as they once were.I originally intended for this phone to be a backup/holiday phone, but I might just start taking it in turns, swapping my sim from the iPhone to the Samsung and vice versa.For the A72, my advice would be to add wireless charging and a stereo speaker setup, even if you need to charge a bit more. Keep the amazing display and lightness and you have yourself a winner.(Review written on my Samsung A71)\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'AnnaK', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Samsung phone at a very reasonable price for the awesome features it comes with.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 September 2020', 'Review Body': ""I love this phone already. I did have a huawei p30 lite but it kept pressing the screen above where I was actually pressing so I'd had enough and bought the Samsung A71 instead. It is definitely worth the price! Nice and responsive, great face recognition. Plays all the games I've tried so far with no issues. The battery lasts a good long while even when I do have battery draining apps running in the back ground.I love the amount of space to install apps, pics or vids! One thing that put me off Samsung phones years ago was the tiny amount of storage it had especially on budget ranges so Im impressed again and this is one of the main factors that brought me back along with the other features and the amazing camera.I love the wide angle cam and the macro camera they are something I'm not use to on a phone and the Macro really does take some nice close up shots of stuff.The phone does have dual sim slots but I have only 1 sim in at the moment so can't review that feature. Like others have said it does have a plastic back but it really doesn't make this phone feel cheap at all and most of the time I have a case on anyway as I'm notorious for dropping phones!Speaking of dropping I have dropped the phone about 5 times from chair height and so far it is in one piece still and no cracks but I do have a case😆UPDATE 2022: This beauty of a phone is still going! Also been dropped about 1000x in the 2 years but barely a scratch. There are a few tiny weeny scratches from not having a phone case with a front cover over and been stuck in jeans pocket all day but they are only visible when the screen is off and looking really close up! ♥️ This phone, it will be put in a display cabinet when it is finally put to rest 🤣\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Michael E', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good all-rounder.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2020', 'Review Body': ""I've been a loyal Oneplus supporter for a long time, been using a Oneplus 3 for many years but I didn't like the curved screens on the new phones. I really needed a bigger capacity phone than my Oneplus. Decided to go for a A71 for its features and price. I've been using this since March. The positives, it's a big phone but I actually prefer that, the OLED screen is great. I had my reservations about the holepunch on the screen for the front camera but I don't mind it now.I got the 128GB model which is great for putting all my files on there and if I ever run out of space, it's got a microsd card slot. A key feature of the phone is the dual-sim card slot. I have one sim card for calls/texts and another for my data. I do save a lot of money by doing it like this. It also retains the audio jack which many phones have phased out.The fingerprint sensor under the screen and the face detection unlock is pretty good though more often than not, sometimes, it just won't detect your fingerprint or face. When it does work, it is very fast. It has quad cameras for various situations. I can't really judge the quality of photos. A photo is a photo to me.For the negatives, the plastic body is very off-putting - you can feel that it's plastic as soon as you touch it and I'm generally used to glass-back phones. I have since bought a glass case for the phone so I don't notice this anymore. The Proximity sensor on the phone doesn't seem very good at all. I have double-tap to wake and It frequently turns on in my pocket and starts dialling numbers. On the other end of the scale, when I pick the phone up from my desk and double-tap, it still thinks it's in my pocket and won't turn on.The biggest negative for me is the battery life. The A71 does have a huge 4,500mAh on board and the reviews and official specs said the phone had great battery life. I haven't properly tested it yet but I doubt I would be able to get more than a couple of hours of screen on time before the battery is depleted. Battery life just doesn't seem all that different from my Oneplus 3.Overall, in retrospect, there are some nice features on the phone but I wish I'd have waited for the Oneplus Nord as that's the phone I should have got. I like the premium feel of a phone and the plastic body on the A71 just doesn't do that for me.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Pammer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 3 October 2024', 'Review Body': 'Handy war super, musste es zurückschicken da ich es irrtümlich bestellt habe.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sabine bedzeti', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 8 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'super alles geklappt bin sehr zufrieden 👍\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stefania', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 3 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Ormai sono anni che usiamo anche telefonia Samsung e non c’è motivo per cambiare!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Cubacub jay', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 23 January 2024', 'Review Body': 'J’aime beaucoup\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Randobos', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 29 October 2023', 'Review Body': ""Acheté en remplacement d'un smartphone usagé.

Let me start by saying that both phones are exceptional considering their price points. However, the A53 has proven to be a significant upgrade from my trusty M31.One standout feature of the A53 that has left me thoroughly impressed is its front-facing fingerprint reader. Unlike the M31, which had its fingerprint sensor on the back, the A53's placement on the front feels more intuitive and convenient. It's a small change, but it makes a big difference in day-to-day usage.Another area where the A53 shines is its screen clarity. Whether I'm streaming Netflix or watching YouTube videos, the display quality is top-notch. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, providing an immersive viewing experience that's hard to match in this price range.In terms of performance, the A53 has proven to be noticeably faster and more responsive than my M31. Apps load swiftly, multitasking is a breeze, and overall, it just feels snappier in everyday use. This improved performance has added to my overall satisfaction with the phone.To complete my experience, I paired the A53 with a Spigen Rugged Armor Phone Case. This combination not only provides excellent protection but also enhances the overall look and feel of the phone. It's become the perfect setup for me, ensuring my device stays safe while still looking stylish.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A53 has proven to be a worthy upgrade from my Galaxy M31. With its front-facing fingerprint reader, impressive screen clarity, and enhanced performance, it has exceeded my expectations. If you're in the market for a budget-friendly smartphone with excellent features, the A53 is definitely worth considering.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nicola Courtney', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Brill phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Really good phone, well priced, 5g, good charging, brill features really just a well rounded decent phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Londoner', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Replaces another that became a problem when local masts all failed', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2022', 'Review Body': ""This offers both 5G and 4G use and also Wi-Fi Connect should normal use be impossible.

There is some Samsung bloatware that some may need (probably not all of it) but they can be deleted.Transfer of data from my old phone was made easy by Samsung (via apps - one installed on the A53 but its partner had to be downloaded onto the old phone); it took about 30-40 minutes.The battery life seems good and far better than on the older phone - unless heavily used, it should be good for a couple of days at least - four is easily possible with a few calls and messages etc.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rob', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Please avoid!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2024', 'Review Body': ""I purchased this phone after previously using a Samsung S20 FE, admittedly my previous model was slightly more expensive, and I was expecting a minor downgrade in performance, but my experience with this phone was DREADFUL, so much so that I've decided to go back to using my old one, despite it now being three years old.I used this product for around a month: it crashed constantly, was agonising slow; even when performing basic functions like writing text messages, it would become incredibly hot when charging and the network connections would randomly disconnect.I don't know if the manufacturer is to blame, or the seller but my advice would be to certainly avoid this product and likely enough the seller.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Chandelle Sabrina', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 10 October 2024', 'Review Body': ""J'en suis très contenteLa charge tiens parfaitementTrès jolie et simple d'utilisationBref au top\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Z.Ir.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 16 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Alles Super!

I got the peacock blue p30 lite for £180. The phone has great battery life. I can play games and it will genuinely last for a long time (ofc will vary from people and typea of games and apps they use). The fingerprint scanner is instant! Like no lag when using it. The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too. But its a fingerprint magnet, so buy a clear case in addition since UK models dont get cases. And oo charges really fast too.It does have a tiny amount of lag when there are lots of apps open but its only 4gb and ONLY for £180 its a no brainer. Obviously, there more expensive phones will be better no doubt, but this will do everythinf you want. And it has google play services too.Will update this review if anything changes.edit: this is after a year of using the phone. DO NOT USE WITHOUT A DECENT CASE AS I UNFORTUNATELY LEARNT MY LESSON. I don't really drop phones, but I ended up dropping this a few times from my pocket because of my wired headphones. (btw..go for Bluetooth...less stress) anyway, Yee, it cracked on front and back, I have alot of spiderweb type cracks from the light impacts on the floor and basically the lesson is to just buy a case, the phone is very delicate. But even after the massive cracks, the phone still works which is okay I guess.also, after using for a while, yeah, you notice the lag once you download a bunch of applications, so while it is I think 128gb, I'd say don't buy expecting to throw a bunch of junk onto it and expecting it to be as fast as the latest Samsung. Have reasonable expectations and it will be a decent device for you. It's a smartphone ;-; does everything you probably need from it unless ya a hardcore mobile gamer.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Guy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A brilliant mobile!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2020', 'Review Body': 'My Huawei P20 Lite got dropped and the screen rather mangled. So, I decided to upgrade - and wow, what a difference!I am so pleased with this purchase. It has plenty of memory, a good display and the rear \'triple\' camera is absolutely fantastic.The P30 Lite is surely comparable with other mobiles costing much more. At £182, this must be considered a bit of a bargain.Its a ""factory"" SIM Free UK device so there are no nasty and annoying telecom logos or additional \'bloatware\'. The power adapter has the correct UK 3-plug and the screen comes ready fitted with a screen protector (albeit not tempered glass). I wish all manufacturers would do that!The mobile auto updated to EMUI (Android) 10 on first power up. I then used Huawei Phone Clone to move data from the old to this new mobile.It did a reasonable job though about 20% of the APPs didn\'t copy (probably due to the change in Android version). So, it took about an hour to manually download and install the missing APPs. The good news was that device set up (eg. WiFi settings, contacts, screen layout) did copy across.I use a slim case and a wireless charging card. Wireless charging works fine and is reasonably quick.I also added a 128gb micro SD card - so I have plenty of space.I don\'t play many games on a mobile but everything I have tried works smoothly and well. Video playback is excellent.I have a Huawei Matebook D 14 2020 laptop so I am able to use \'Huawei Share\' to connect to and control this mobile. Its great when working at home.If I wanted to be harsh, I could say that battery life could be a tad better. That said, it easily lasts a day and has improved after a couple of full charges - I just bung the mobile on my wireless charger when I go to bed.Overall, I am very chuffed and rather pleased....\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'JayniaK', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'P30 Lite review', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2020', 'Review Body': ""This review is for the Huawei P30 Lite 2019The build quality of the phone is excellent, I wasn't expecting a premium look and feel for the price.The screen is fantastic, vivid and extremely clear.On using thee phone, apps runs super smooth, no lag or stutters at all you really would think this phone costs many hundreds of pounds if you didn't know the price.Multi tasking is easy, even half n half screen like YouTube and Facebook at the same time no stutters nolag.Internet WiFi is strong with not one issue.Loads of storage 128gb always great.Games look very colourful and run perfectly.Videos look amazing.Camera is in a league of its own for this price point.Now the big question does this phone  lose play store after updating to android 10?

Battery life and how quickly it charges - amazing. Fingerprint scanner - amazing. In fact amazing is just an understatement. I have always loved Huawei phones since getting my first one back in Spring 2017. I will try to hold out with Huawei for as long as possible (even if it means to continuously buy pre-May 2019 phones). Literally, what more can I say?

Build quality is okay and the swivel base and hinges work well enough, but I have found that it sometimes can topple when my tablet sits on it or when I try to adjust with it on. I also like that there is a gap on the back panel to allow a charger or other cable to be fed through.It's okay but I'm not entirely enamoured with it.

Ace battery life, easy 1.5 days for my use (Twitter, YouTube + Music). The 512GB storage is extremely welcome. I actually prefer this over an SD card slot, as having it only on internal storage helps with app compatibility for playing large video files. Charging is very quick indeed with the included charger.Screen is really good, the high refresh rate is welcome but it's the colour profiles that do it for me. I like a cooler white for my displays and this lets you go as warm or as cool as you like, or tailor for your content needs like DCI-P3. The only niggle is the night mode - the minimum brightness isn't low enough for me, and there is a bug with the reading mode timer. It does not automatically make the display reduce blue colours at night, I find I have to manually switch. An annoyance but not a dealbreaker.Performance is excellent, MediaTek is back in the game with this chip. Handles the games I want (Old School Runescape and Pokemon go) with ease. It would be better if Pokemon ran at 120hz but I assume this is an issue with the game not the phone, it has the horsepower for it. App switching is brilliant, seems to keep apps in memory for ages. Fast loading of everything I use. The phone never feels hot. As with anything though, your mileage may vary.Camera is passable. The night mode is pretty good but you have to be patient with it while it takes the exposure. Macro is useless, I can't figure out how to activate it. Wide angle is good enough in daylight but forget it for regular room lighting. I would prefer to remove the macro and wide angle cameras and have a decent 4x telephoto. Don't be fooled by the design, in practice this phone has 3 cameras not 4 as the cooker hob shape would imply.I found the corners on the back of the phone were picking up the colour of my black jeans (the pocket inside is black too) but some pleather cleaner I use on the car upholstery works perfect on this. The material is lasting pretty good so far, no wear or tear I can see after I would guess 500 pocket insertions. Black plastic rails are absolutely fine with me.Comes with an included in plastic screen protector, which is welcome but I easily scratched it with my thumb nail. Looks like there are replacements online but I haven't bought one yet.The software gets out of your way and lets you do what you need. There's not much bloatware, a few of the Xiaomi apps have ads in them (the Security app for example always opens with an ad for me) but you don't need them to operate the phone. I have not had a security update since I've owned the phone, which is a little worrying. I doubt this will get the next version of Android. Don't expect any fancy AI features here like you see advertised with the Samsung flagships.Overall - just what I wanted. Price point excellent. Storage is fast and 512GB should now be the industry standard. Performance is excellent. Included charger is a bonus, double bonus it's so fast. Just don't expect software to get better.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mr A', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bought this as I had broke my other phone, very impressed with the quality.

The other positive is it's software - very fast and intuitive (inspired by iOS).The camera is good but not flagship so if you need the best camera get yourself iPhone or Samsung S24, also no 3.5mm mini jack and its water-resistant only to rain so if you want to swim with your phone look somewhere else.

Some would not load, which I put down to it being Android Go.Some apps would install okay, but routinely crash.The most irritating was that some apps (Microsoft Authenticator and other MS apps) would ONLY work if I turned off Wifi to use mobile data, whilst others would ONLY work if I turned Wifi on, so I spent a lot of time stalling and having to keep flicking the settings on and off to get apps to run.If you stick with the basics this phone is reasonable for the price as a basic phone, but if you actually want to use it as a proper smart phone, it's definitely under par.Edit May 2024I have been since been contacted by Blackview in response to the phone issues.  This speaks volumes to their customer service as they offered a replacement model due to my experiences.Unfortunately I have already upgraded to another brand due to a deal found, but I have instead been offered a refund.This is amazing service, taking their customer issues to heart and making effort to redeem any loss of faith in their brand.I was very happy with my previous Blackview phone, but having had 2 unrelated issues with their phones I had lost some faith in the lower priced phone market. Even the model I went for stretched my budget on a deal as I upped the price range as a result of avoiding the sub £400 market.I will certainly be looking at Blackview again in future given this level of service and commitment to their customer base.

The microSDXC socket allowed fitting of a SanDisk 512GB Extreme PRO memory card which hopefully will allow future expansion and a longer phone life.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Michelle', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good purchase', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Only had this phone for 24 hours and so far I am very pleased with my purchase .

This offering from Doogee was keenly priced and sounded good on paper. whilst it quickly became obvious that this is a more basic phone than it's 4 year old predecessor I've stuck with it, and got most of the annoying little kinks sorted out. The first issue I encountered during set up was the lack of British English available from the settings, I went with US English to get it going. After enduring an American voice and the lack of £ sign for several weeks I knew I had to find a solution. Fortunately returning to language settings revealed the required UK language. The other major issue I encountered was the impossibility of connecting the phone to my PC to transfer photos, etc. You could connect it and reconnect it as many times as you like but it just wouldn't allow data to be transfered. After a bit of searching I found a very helpful gentleman from India had added a video to Youtube explaining how to set up debugging and get a phone to connect properly, another problem solved. Compared to my old phone it is a little sluggish doing some things, eg screen rotation, however as my phone needs are fairly basic I'm happy to keep going with it. The N50 looks much like any other smart phone these days, personally I rather like the colourful plastic back, the camera is ok for daylight use and it has lots of storage space.

I can't speak as a former samsung owner as I never went through the exynos period of mobiles where battery seemed to be lacking but I did come from the nothingphone (1) which is considered a midtier mobile and I can see differences between the two.I'll start of with my previous phone, the nothing phone (1) which was the gimmick phone with the clear back and lights released july 2022 and actually it's been a decent phone. The battery life was really good and would typically last about a day and often longer so seemed to pair well with the seven series chip that it was using, It was a good phone but NOTHING much more to say. The Thing I didn't like about the phone was the quality control, I spoted dust underneath the near glass panel meaning it was either there on purchase or over time slipped in and was there to stay, there are other reports of this as well as screen issues and with glyph lights. The overall feel of the phone in the hand was ok but there was something hollow about it and a sense that it was going to fall apart eventually.Although unnecessary I decided I wanted something a bit smaller from a more reputible brand with quality products. I've had samsung devices in the past such as the Tab S7+ and was very impressed with the quality then so I made the plunge to buy the S23. The first thing I notice on arrival is the quality difference between nothing and the S23 just by holding it. There were no sharp edges (those complaining of such have never experienced a sharp edge clearly), the weight although heavy for some is appreciated by myself as it's typically a sign of quality, the frame feels far more sturdy and grippy and the glass backing repells fingerprinters well and doesn't feel cheap, so far so good.The software/GUI, One UI 5.1 is really enjoyable to use and looks neat with everything easily accessible and customizable (Except playstore icons! argh!) aside from that really nice to use. The one problem I do have however is out of the box bloatware, I don't know why typically asian brands load their devices with unwanted apps, (Xiaomi does it as well) fortunately it isn't hard to uninstall them and I appreciate that they don't force us to have these perminately.I want to be fair on the phone in regards to the battery because I understand the type of device i've come from and moved onto and it's my own choice in doing so. If i'm comparing battery with the nothing phone it does lose as I will typically get over a day of use from nothing and maybe 10hrs+ from the S23. It all comes down to my typical use case but that is what happens when you go from a phone with 4500mAh with a midtier processor to 3900mAh with a toptier processor. I wanted the smaller phone and will need to put up with the smaller battery, something I will adapt and get used to. Considering the phones nice size however I am happy with the use I get from it and the software seems well optimized.The S23 cameras are really nice, will they be the best? no of course not there will always be better cameras out there, The S23 ultra for example will have better cameras because it's even more of a premium phone with better goodies built in. That said the S23 takes some really nice clear imagery without a ridiculous amount of processing, I can tell there's some slight sharpening but not terrible levels. In the end it makes great photo's in both lighter and darker enviornments. (Photo's taken using 3:4 50MP, scene optimizer off, effects off)I'm sure there are other points I can make but as a conclusion I would recommend the S23 to anyone who can afford it and is typically used to small phones. You will be paying a premium but in return you are getting a quality, well developed product that will likely last you years.Edit: I've had the phone for about a month now and it's still running well. The battery seems to learn your usage patterns and adapts based on that. I now get a day or more (based on usage).Some reviews complain of very minor problems which is simply put, part of being an android user and not likely down to the phone itself. If you want a very simple easy to use phone without a gram of faff, go to iPhone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dan Scott', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'I was in much need of an upgrade, this phone has done just the trick.

But overall, the quality of the pictures is acceptable and much better than that of my old phone.Charging is blistering fast and you can also use wireless charging (charger not included).I can't say much about the battery life as I've only received the phone a couple of days ago, but it lasted a full day easily and with a top-up of 10 minutes it will last even more.The design of the phone is nice and the materials used feel premium and fingerprint resistant (other than the camera which is a fingerprint magnet).

Originally a £640 phone when launched 18 months ago, the phone has had 2 major android version updates and will get one more, plus further security updates, so is still bang up to date, whilst having earlier software niggles well and truly sorted. The sd 8+ gen 1 chip offers near current gen flagship performance whilst being very stable (next to no throttling) and efficient, considerably more so than the none plus version in the pro model.Talking of battery life, it's very good, currently averaging 7.5 hrs sot, and the ridiculous super charging (150watt charger included!) means the phone can fully charge in the time it takes to make a cup tea. Seriously this is a game changer for me, knowing a 10 minute charge will give me 60%+ battery is super convenient.Camera is decent (and improved further by installing a gcam port, though not at all required), build quality excellent, as is the (thankfully flat) 120hz display.Ultimately this was a decent phone at lunch, but an absolute bargain now at barely 1/3 of the price, coming in cheaper than a number of far worse specced budget phones.

Don't listen to the biased reviewers, decided to go for this one after giving Pixel 6 a try for a few months and it was like a breath of fresh air. 80w charging is something you can't overlook, especially since you get the actual charging brick in the box,plus a free case and a preinstalled screen protector. OnePlus have stuck to their super thin and light design, great built quality and the exterior is amazing (granted the camera module design is an acquired taste) no complaints there, at least from me. The phone looks super premium, fingerprint works flawlessly, God I missed that, especially whilst having been stuck with the pixel... Camera quality is up there, hardly the best but definitely not mediocre. 10bit shots can come up with some insane results, more than enough for the average every day user. The display is just out of this world, resolution is great, refresh rate I'd say matches the performance of my recently departed 8T. Battery life would vary, on a heavy duty day, I'd be at about 20% around 8pm-ish so can easily stretch to a full day depending on usage, mind you the super fast charging more than makes up for that. If you come from an earlier OnePlus, then the new incarnation of the oxygen os would be a bit of a disappointment but still dominating most of the alternatives on the market. Generally speaking if you're looking for that established OnePlus experience you can't go wrong, despite the relatively higher price point, I believe it's still more than worth it if you're considering OnePlus.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Javier', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on 21 April 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es un teléfono que funciona muy bien y por el precio es mejor\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sabrina Mardikian', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on 11 April 2024', 'Review Body': ""I'd like to start by saying the phone appears to be basically brand new zero issues.

It's nippy enough for all the basic apps and even a few simple games.It feels nice in the hand, solid and well built, but not too heavy.Looks wise, it's much like any new phone, it looks simple but smart.It has a nice big screen, colours are actually great, nice and vibrant, not dull like some cheaper phones.In fact, other than the resultion being a bit lower than my much more expensive phone, I much prefer the colours and vibrancy of this screen.The pictures I included really don't do the screen justice, it looks a LOT better than that in person.It's alos plenty bright enough, I wouldn't have it above 80% unless I was in bright daylight.It's a clean android build so no annoying bundled apps/games/etc that you don't need.Wifi and mobile data speeds are good, it may not hit the max for 4G but it's still plenty fast enough for most people.The only odd thing was the lack of the usual back and home buttons at the bottom.  Instead the back button is at the top left and to get to the home screen you just swipe up from the bottom.To see open apps, swipe up but hold your finger on the screen and it will show you all open apps in a carousel.Apprently that is actually the stock Android back buttons etc, when you get on all other phones are actually designed by the phone manufactuer (even Google themselves don't use Stock Android, they developed a different interface).That's all a bit technical for most people the fact is once you get used to the different way of navigating the phone it's perfectly fine.Google Play Store works fine, all the usual apps are available to install (I've had cheap phones in the past that couldn't install many apps as they weren't approved for the device).That said, I can't guarantee every single one of the millions of Android apps will work, but all the banking, paypay, shopping, games, etc, etc that I tried were availble and worked perfectly fine.I checked the specifications with a few different apps that can determine whether a device has been altered to show higher specs than the phone actually has.I'm pleased to say this is exactly as advertised.6GB RAM (extendable to 18GB, this is not enabled by default so if you want that you need to change it in the settings, it's easy enough).  128GB storage, 720x1600 display resolution (at this price that's perfectly acceptable) and the display is 90Hz which is plenty high enough for most uses and games.Android 13 and dual SIM are also both correct.The 8 core CPU is fine and powerful enough for most people and not unusual at this price (Unisoc T606, I have a tablet with the same CPU), Android and all the apps I use run nice and smooth.I haven't tried the fingerprint reader or face unlock but they are there and recognised by Android.They even bundle a clear silicone case, charging cable and charging plug in the box, which many of the big brands dont do, even with their higher end phones.The only sub par part is the camera, but they do tell you the main camera is only 13MP so I'm not taking a star away from that, I knew what I was buying and so should you if you read the specs before buying.Still, it takes decent enough shots in bright light. Low light isn't great, but if someone is buying a phone and wants a great camera they would be looking to spend more than £70-100 anyway.All in all it's fantastic value at it's current £70 price, I'd say it would still be worth buying at up to £100, so if you want a bargain phone that still performs well but without a top notch camera, this is a solid choice, especially right now while the price is low.If OUKITEL do higher end phones with better cameras at a decent price, I'd even consider getting one for myself!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Raluca Sisu', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect phone for a teenager', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this phone as a birthday gift for my son on his 15th birthday.

Its dual SIM capability is convenient for managing personal and work numbers on one device or when traveling on holiday with a local number and the 13MP + 5MP camera setup takes decent photos under good lighting conditions.  One other nice tough is that it comes out of the box already in a nice lightweight clear TPU case which grips and fits the hand really nicely.Overall, this smartphone is an great choice if you want a feature-rich smart phone, suited to everyday use and offers good value at €89.99 in my humble opinion.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'robert turner', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very pleased so far apart from the number of Temu adverts.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2024', 'Review Body': ""Nice sturdy phone.

I don't know if I'd throw this into my tech bag when traveling because of the prongs but it folds up small enough that I feel comfortable sandwiching it between clothes in my other bags to protect both the stand and keep the prongs from bumping up against anything else that's hard while traveling.

However, the initial excitement quickly wore off as several issues emerged.The camera performs decently in well-lit conditions, but it struggles terribly in low light, rendering it practically useless in darker environments.The battery life, which was initially sufficient for a full day, has deteriorated significantly. It now overheats frequently and barely lasts an hour on a full charge.While the touchscreen remains responsive and the display is bright and clear, the phone's performance suffers greatly when multiple apps are open or when attempting to watch videos. It becomes painfully slow and often requires a restart to regain functionality.Although the included screen protector and case were a nice touch, they couldn't compensate for the phone's overall shortcomings. It functioned adequately for a short period, but the battery and performance issues have forced me to return it.In conclusion, while this phone may seem appealing due to its low price, the compromised build quality and rapidly declining performance make it a poor investment.

Id never heard of them until I bought the phone, and have in that time also bought a watch which again is absolutely brilliant and considering it was less than £20 I'm just gobsmacked, connectivity was easy to set up and all runs smoothly. My only gripe is WiFi calling does not work with the Smarty network, so I'm investigating another network. But all in all a great product with decent support in place.

This is my first Google phone, but I've owned two of their tablets.I wouldn't normally pay as much for a phone, but with 5 years of OS updates, and 7 years of security updates (from the launch date), I worked out that the cost per supported-year worked out than cheaper brands like Xiaomi. Of course, this only works out if I can manage to look after it well enough for 5+ years.I also wanted to steer clear of the Chinese brands (Oppo, OnePlus, RedMi and Xiaomi), as they have started to use very aggressive power saving of background apps, which was causing issues when switching between apps like a browser and 2FA authentication apps, causing the browser page to reload. I'm pleased to say that I've not had any such issues with the Google Pixel 8a.The Pixel 8a has a good, clear screen, a very good CPU (same as on the 8), and snappy performance. Battery life is good, and the camera is decent, but I would have preferred a higher zoom on the telephoto camera.What I dislike is that 4G internet pickup isn't as strong as my old Redmi Note 10 Pro, and when in supermarkets I often struggle to get the loyalty apps to load quickly/at all, whereas the RedMi had no trouble at all.I also dislike that the Google search box appears on the home screen, and they don't allow you to remove it, and for me it is just a waste of screen real estate.The phone also uses an optical fingerprint sensor under the screen, and this is noticeably slower than the physical ones I've used, and honestly a bit of a step backward both in speed and security.Another thing that's a step backward is the lack of a micro SD card slot, and headphone port. If you're a music, photography or videography fan, then the lack of these may be an issue. (Of course all phone makers are getting rid off SD card slots now, so they can charge you vastly over the odds per GB for increased internal storage).Would I recommend it, yes, if you look after your phones and plan to keep it for 4 years+, but there are cheaper options if you only want to keep the phone for a couple of years.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Steve Harman', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""A new phone that's got great stuff that's backed up for 7 years.

This runs Android 14 and is guaranteed system and security updates for several years, which for me is a huge benefit as I only change my phone infrequently. The camera is excellent - a 2x true zoon and a digital zoom to 8x. The quality of the pictures has been very good and there are far more options for editing in the phone than in Android 9 - quite a revelation as to how phones have come on. Hand held long exposures are possible (for example flowing water) and on this setting a ""normal"" photo is captured at the same time. Useful to be able to compare the two and keep the better shot. There is also a wide angle zoom to 0.5x but this has to be used with caution as there is quite a lot of ""fisheye"" distortion. It will work better in some situations than others. The battery life is also proving very good. I\'m a light user and get four days between recharges (and even then I\'ve usually got 20%-30% left). The screen is crisp and sharp and copes in most lighting conditions, the exception being bright sunshine when it can seem a bit dark so making taking photos a bit hit and miss.Overall for me this has been a worthwhile upgrade and it really is probably one of the best mid-range phones available.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'david abengozar muñoz', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 29 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Buen teléfono.

Smaller icons and text).Battery life is amazing and leaves the S24U in the dust.

The Xperia takes more realistic photos but the S24U looks brighter and, in some scenarios, makes the photos look better.

The ""renewed"" phone arrived promptly, safely packaged in a plain cardboard box labelled ""Used-Good"", with a generic charger and cable. Cosmetically the phone is closer to ""Very Good"" condition, with just a tiny scratch on the screen not noticeable when in use. The battery was fully discharged when it arrived so first job was to allow it to charge to 100% which took approx 3 hours. I then checked all was working; this is largely intuitive for Android users but the user instruction manual is on the phone under ""Settings > User Manual"" if needed. The phone I received is running Android 7; the screen icons look a touch dated!Having made sure all was well with the J5 I immediately ordered a suitable phone case - I chose a Lihondar case. (I find my 20th century fingers and 21st century smartphones are not compatible, so having a case on the phone makes it much harder to drop and easier to use).I installed the following apps: TuneIn Radio, Mixcloud, BBC Sounds, The Revival Show, Internetradiouk.com, plus a few others. All work well although BBC Sounds does seem to suffer a glitch now and then. Commentary from the BBC sports website works smoothly. Battery life is perfectly OK for my needs, lasting around three days of on/off use with Bluetooth turned on. Sound quality (what we used to call ""tone""!) on the phone\'s speaker is actually surprisingly good - more pleasant to listen to than my main phone.In summary, after several weeks\' use I am very happy with this purchase. The ""renewed"" J5 phone does all I expected, the condition is very good and the price is reasonable.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Linda Woodward', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Didn’t work out for me', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'As a refurbished phone this was excellent, not a mark on it and good value I felt.

No. Non of that.Dislikes? My phone came locked to Lebara (sp?) so couldn\'t be set up with the SIM (not a data SIM before you ask!)Also, it was impossible to use the intended SIM in either of the phone\'s SIM slots because even the first slot only takes mini, micro and nano SIMs so, if you need a handset to work with a perfectly functional full size SIM, this one will be of no more use than an ashtray on a motorcycle. Worse than that; the device itself doesn\'t work with any of the sub 16gGB - the stated maximum in the instruction pamphlet -  micro sd cards that I tried with it, not even an older 2GB one which always works in another device.And that was as far as I could get without being able to put a SIM up to it.Also, the TTFONE website isn\'t working, it throws a 404 error every time I try to visit from a suitable device and, were that not enough, the customer ""services"" phone number doesn\'t connect either, some services! Service my backside. 😠OK, so the handset is cheap but is described as being new, a term that I understand as meaning split new, box fresh, not previously used and loaded with someone else\'s information.Maybe you will get one that\'s genuinely new, maybe yours won\'t be impossible to use but, either way, a pre owned, slightly scruffy handset of greater quality  could easily be found for little or no more of your money so that\'s my recommendation; buy a good quality but older device. It\'s not going to be unusable in the way that an older smartphone might be if it lacks the connectivity we all need nowadays, something from one of the quality brands could be yours in fully functional, working condition for very little money, even with working Bluetooth, another thing absent in this piece of junk.Sorry, but this thing is utterly useless and its low price isn\'t an excuse for that, not given its absence of fitness for purpose.Avoid like the plague.  😠\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good value for money', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'The phone set up was easy it charged quickly and very simple to navigate, ideal for children and the elderly.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gill', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Easy to use, no Internet on it which is ideal for kids.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'carol kearney', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'ordered this phone by mistake should have ordered a Big Numers) one', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'returned phone ordered by mistake...looks good though.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Vivian', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good product', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very good phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'B.N.H.', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Crap phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'I bought this for my pensioner father Seemed ok at the begining but soon turned into a troublesome waste of money and time.

Let me share my personal insights:The Good:Vanilla Android: The clean, uncluttered Android experience is a breath of fresh air. It's efficient, user-friendly, and offers a pure Google experience without any bloatware.Camera: The camera lives up to the Pixel's reputation. It captures stunning images with great detail and color accuracy, making it a joy for photography enthusiasts like myself.Dual SIM Capability: This is a big plus for me as I have business number. Having the ability to use two SIMs simultaneously is incredibly convenient.Size: The compact size of the Pixel 8 is perfect for one-handed use. It fits comfortably in my pocket and feels great to hold.The Bad:Battery Life: This has been a significant letdown. The battery drains quickly, and I find myself needing to charge the phone more often than I'd like.Random Disconnects from Mobile Internet: Thephone unexpectedly looses mobile internet connectivity, which is incredibly disappointing.Poor Reception: Surprisingly, my old Moto G, which was significantly cheaper, had better reception. This was a bit of a shock, considering the Pixel's premium status.Patchy Android Experience: While I love the clean Android interface, there have been occasional lags and glitches. I'm hopeful that a future update will resolve these issues.Stripped Down Camera Tech Compared to Pro Model: As much as I appreciate the camera quality, knowing that the Pro model has significantly more advanced technology does make me feel like I'm missing out on the best Pixel camera experience.In conclusion, the Google Pixel 8 is a bit of a mixed bag. While it excels in camera quality, software, and form factor, it falls short in battery life, connectivity, and reception. It's a phone with great potential, but these drawbacks are something to consider before making a purchase.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dip Sankar Das', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best smartphone within budget', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Pros : Best smartphone ever I have used within budget.

He was using a Blackview phone already, a tuff, old-style button phone.  But as things have changed in recent years with mobile networks, a log of txts weren't making it to him (I'm guessing it's down to txt encryptions that are now implemented).  Stuck behind the times, he seriously needed this upgrade.As many of us are aware, specs of a new phone matter.  You choose a device with say 32GB, then you'll more than likely lose over half of that space to the operating system.  The smallest size you should look for should be anywhere upwards of 128GB, with a RAM of at least 8GB.  The higher you go with the RAM, the faster you'll find your device.  These are really the basics you should look for in your device, which makes this phone perfect, and has double the RAM!With these specs, the processor will do the rest, and this is shipped with a T616 processor.  Does that mean anything to me?  Not at all.  But seriously, you're not going to pack something rubbish into a phone when everything else is on point.Charging is key, and having rapid/fast charge should be what you look for in any phone these days.The camera is pretty standard, with excellent megapixel rear camera, and your standard lower megapixel front camera.  This is pretty much the same with any device.  But a 50MP camera on the rear is quite impressive.So, back to my friend.  I helped him set up his new device, and I was very quickly impressed with the build quality, huge screen size, and simply how fast the device was.  He was immediately impressed with getting a full charge in a single hour of charging!  Although he's only been using the device for a month, he's still learning, he hasn't said one single bad thing about it.  Pretty impressive for £119.99!I'm so impressed that my upgrade will most likely be a Blackview!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Bradley', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent phone for the price .

As pensioners we don’t want to pay out tens of pounds each month when we have a small family and make or receive few calls. So purchasing phones rather than being ripped off in contracts makes fantastic economic sense. This phone is nearly perfect. It’s faster than our eight year old Mobile’s, the screen is better, photo quality is great, everything is better. Except, there is no tap capability. We have to suffer the hardship of taking out our debit or credit cards from the phone cases and inserting them into a card machine. Apart from this small detail (I thought it was so common now that the feature did not merit a mention in the description) the phone is brilliant. They also came with free wireless  earphones.

However, the battery was getting bad and phone was so slow, after nearly 10 years, I gave in and got this phone, which is available cheaper via Amazon than with 'another well known provider'.  The difference has blown my mind.  Battery life is excellent (mine lasts for days without a recharge), storage for new apps and dapps is amazing.  It really is like walking around with your own personal computer.  And the price, well, this one was amazing too (should have done it years ago).  If you are looking for a very decent phone with many bells and whistles, for a very reasonable price (I got mine sim free, and just popped in my old sim into this one) - then this phone is for you.  NB:  To pop in your old sim into this phone, see the little silver wire (with a hoop on the end - you hold the hoop bit) and pop the length end of the (sturdy) wire into the tiny hole at the top left of the phone to release the catchment cubby where you can pop your sim card in.  This wire/sim tool comes with your phone in your box. PS: Don't forget, for just under 8 quid to buy a quality phone case to protect your new phone.  I got the Kuafcase for Samsung A13/A04S Case with 1 Screen Protector on Amazon at the same time. Would recommend this phone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Steven Molyneux', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone...But!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2023', 'Review Body': ""Everything is good.

I'm a heavy user for things like sat nav etc, and I like the screen brightness up high, getting old, so for me brightness is key, but it seems to drop to 85% quite quickly when turning it on in the morning.

One small issue, is that the app icon badges, on the menu and home page, are a bit small, for someone with more mature eye sight. There are  options to enlarge them a bit, in the settings. But they still remain a bit too small. But she seems to cope with it and we have made the wallpaper a neutral colour, to try and enhance their visability.

I have a new one every 3 to 4 months or so due to my work. My personal phone is usually one that doesnt matter to me but i get decent ones. My last phone was a pixel 6a. Problem was very low brightness, rubbish battery (some days only 3.5 to 4 hour on screen time) and poor standby time. Sold it. Before that was iphone 11. Great battery and camera but only 4g and restricted user os (ios) i like to download torrents etc 😉 and few other probles with ios buggs etc. Before that was Xaiomi 11 pro. Good battery but adverts (turned most off but would still show every now and then. And a Nokia 8.3 wich was quite poor to be honest BUT decided to give Nokia another try as back in the 90s by love for Nokia was sky high. (I know this is not a proper one its a hmd global).So thought why not try the cheap g60.Im sooooo glad i did. Nice and bright LED screen,Very nice haptic feedback (vibration on keyboard etc) and very nice in the hand.After initial setup i was amazed how far mid range phones have come. Its fantastic. I know that every now and then the os stutters but i have the 4gb ram 64gb version but not as buggy as the iphone and not as too googley as the pixel if you know what i mean. The camera is quite good for every day pictures. The screen is bright and decent 5g and the battery life....... Well put it this way. I start work at 3am. Standby it does not go down. Screen on time ive got 9 hours plus. That by like using it as satnave with bluetooth, wifi, all apps running in background like fb whatsapp xda instagram all of them (i have about 70 apps installed) and have sdcard for photos etcIt really is fantastic. Its not the fastest but its reliable.Even youtube plays at 1080p without a hickup.

I bought this as a replacement for the X10 (a great phone) and had high hopes given the technical specs.It's a beautiful piece of equipment, as with all HMD phones. Not too big, nicely proportioned, sits comfortably in the average hand, and with a little notch cmfront camera that doesn't detract from the screen.It has all the features you would expect of a modern android smartphone, including a very decent camera (with a passable night mode for the price), split screen mode, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, etc. etc. It has a 3.5mm headphone port and supports fast charging by USB-c. All good stuff.But it's a bit slow compared to older HMD phones I've had. Loading up apps takes a noticeable fraction longer than I'd expect, but it's within the apps you notice the speed most - launching Google search bar is quick but it takes a good few seconds before the keyboard appears, for example. Small, but annoying.The speaker is also much quieter than any other HMD phones I've had before. Not negatively so - it's still just about loud enough - but it's a step backwards for sure.There are also currently (September 2023) issues with Android 13 that make it difficult to use.

Another problem with my old phone was that it wasn\'t compatible with my HSBC banking app. This is still a very slimline & compact phone, measuring just 76mm x 164mm x 8.5mm and weighing in at 190g.  It\'s a 4G phone which is absolutely fine for me.  It\'s not locked to any particular carrier, and can take 2 SIM cards (nano size), and a micro-SD card of up to 512GB.  It runs Android 11 at the moment.  Charging & data transfer are via a C-type USB plug in agreement with the new EU standard.  To transfer files to & from your PC, you need to go into the ""Connected Devices"" setting, & select ""File Transfer"" from the USB option.  Alternatively, just remove the Micro-SD card, place it in an adaptor, & plug it directly into your PC.  It\'s compatible with a fast 18W charger, which shaves some time off the recharge time.  The 5050 mAh battery is not removable (unlike my old C01 Plus).The front camera is 8MP, while the back one is 50MP.  Like all smartphones, it looks a bit like the Monolith in 2001, although the back is a nice dark blue colour (Nordic Blue).  It does have some advanced features like a fingerprint reader, although I prefer to log into my phone using my PIN.  Unlike my previous phone, this one IS compatible with my HSBC mobile banking app, and the Tesco banking app.  It also has a built-in FM radio with RDS, which I find to be a very useful feature!  I\'m surprised many boom-boxes don\'t have RDS, since it fits fine into my phone & MP3 player! There\'s space for about 25 icons on the first screen, which is fine, and you can have your less-used icons on the 2nd screen.  I\'m really happy with it, although I\'m not really a smartphone guru- but for me, it\'s more than adequate.  I\'d recommend this phone for anyone looking for a well-priced unit, of fairly high spec.Recent problem:  I\'ve noticed recently that sometimes my new phone can get quite slow, or even freeze in the middle of using it.  Sometimes it gets so slow that the only option seems to be to restart it.  I\'m not sure what the problem is- perhaps too many processor-hungry apps running in the background?  Another problem I had was that it wouldn\'t play some of my MPEG2 videos.  I solved this by downloading VLC media player from the Play Store.Lastly, the phone doesn\'t come with a detailed instruction manual, but you can download a PDF instruction manual from nokia.com.  Just search for nokia g21 instructions.Update:  My phone has recently upgraded itself to Android 13, which doesn\'t seem to me to have a lot of differences from 11 or 12, although the display may be a little more user-friendly now...\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'daisylousheldon', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Do not buy.

Nothing impressive and it's clearly a low-end phone. Think the Dacia of phones.It feels solid enough in use, but mine lasted maybe a year before the audio gave out. They repaired that and then around six months later the thing refused to boot and they told me my warranty was up. Which is disappointing when you consider it isn't supposed to be a 2 year warranty.

I then started to look at their phones and research OxygenOS and liked what I saw.I then discovered the Nord series - midrange handsets with near flagship level features/specs and started investing more time into it. I found out the latest Nord model would release. So after weeks of mulling it over and directly comparing the P30 against the Nord 2 I decided to take the plunge.I took delivery of the phone the next day and set about unboxing and setting it up. I was like a kid at Christmas. The phone came in a nice looking black box with simple blue lines down the side and the OnePlus Nord branding imprinted on the front. When you shine light on the Nord lettering and look from a certain angle you can see a multi-colour reflection.I then unboxed the phone which came with a screen protector preinstalled and a clear rubber case (when you set the phone down on a flat surface with the case on and turn on the torch the entire thing lights up around the edges and looks pretty snazzy) Also included is the 65w charger, red USB-C cable, SIM removal tool, documents and a very nice letter from OnePlus.Holding the phone in my hand without the case, I have to say it feels amazing, it's a really comfy phone to hold and unlike any phone I've held before, because of the materials it's made from. It's kind of hard to explain but it just feels nice in the hand. It's almost like a silky smooth texture with very slight roughness for grip.Anyway, I powered on and set up the phone, logged in with my Google details, ran all the system software updates and installed all my apps. I then went to settings to do some tinkering and customise the OS to a look and feel of my liking. Everything is easy to find in the settings and there's a respectable amount of things to customise for the OS (colours, AOD, fonts, wallpapers, horizon light for notifications etc)As for OxygenOS itself I like it - very fresh, clean and simple. And it'll only get better once 12.0 releases. It's currently 4 April 2022 as I'm writing this and I'm still waiting for 12.0 so hopefully it'll be here soon. A Theme store and more new features will be getting added, as far as I'm aware. Just search OxygenOS 12 to see the new additions.The MediaTek Dimensity 1200 chipset is as good as any on-par Qualcomm Snapdragon and can handle graphic intensive games like COD Mobile with ease - No overheating. No lag. Nothing of the sort that I've noticed. The MediaTek is a solid performing chipset and the glue that holds everything together. Great levels of performance with no noticeable frame drops or dips during gameplay or in general daily usage.As for the refresh rate the Nord 2 might only have 90Hz capability and not the 120Hz of some flagship models but it's obviously better than 60Hz and is pretty much the sweet spot, as battery life would suffer under 120Hz. You can have it in either 90Hz or 60Hz mode but sometimes the phone will switch between modes depending on the scenario. I leave it on 90Hz for the most part and it's fine.The FHD+ Fluid AMOLED display with HDR10+ makes for impressive viewing - sharp looking details, vibrant & true to life colours which pop nicely (you can change vividness in settings) and overall just a nice, big, bright, crystal clear viewing experience - games, TV series, movies and YouTube all look amazing!The 4500mAh battery with 65w charging is a godsend and will get you out of a jam, for example if you're short on time. I've put the Nord 2 on charge at around 15%, gone away then come back about 25 minutes later and it's already at 100%. They weren't lying about the charging speed.Awesome camera, too! Shots with the built-in Sony IMX766 Exmor sensor look sharp with nice accurate colour and detail, however some shots do look washed out. Night shots look decent but not the best and can look overprocessed and grainy due to the AI scene recongition mode. I'll admit I've been spoiled by the P30's Leica AG camera though (one of the best smartphone cameras ever produced) so the experience might be different for you depending on what phone you're coming from.As for Audio, I do miss the baked in DolbyAtmos audio from the P30 which gave rich, detailed and crystal clear sound across the board with several scenario based modes to choose from, despite only having the one loudspeaker. The Nord 2 has arguably worse audio on balance but it does have the benefit of two loudspeakers which does claw back some of that loss.All in all, there is more than enough with the Nord 2 to warrant it as a truly worthy near-flagship upgrade from whichever device you're using now, like me with the P30 for example (I know, the standard P30 isn't a flagship)Nord 2 is a very capable device and has something for everyone with its impressive spec sheet and range of apps and features. I've had the 8GB RAM model for 7 months now and its still hitting the high notes like the day I got it. I can imagine the 12GB RAM variant is basically Nord 2 on roids. I fully recommend you to get this phone, you won't be sorry!Thanks for taking the time to read this. I might come back with edits from time to time.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'staceystewart91', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Fantastic phone for price but has drawbacks', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2022', 'Review Body': 'The Nord 2 is a fantastic phone for it\'s price. For a mid range phone it is priced very well. The Oxygen OS is slick, customizable and easy to use. The phone itself (8GB Ram) is plenty fast enough for most users. Fingerprint is fast, facial recognition is fast, charging is genuinely fast. Like silly fast. Like you almost feel bad how fast it charges.However, the phone does have some drawbacks. The main camera (50mp) is good, don\'t get me wrong. But, it does come with some flaws. The 50mp lens is just that. No optical (this is advertised) but it also cannot digital zoom. You cannot change any settings (AI etc) on the 50mp lens, just focus/Auto focus. It does take good pictures but it will not be the default when you open up the camera app. If you\'re in a rush trying to take a picture of something, you will have to manually change it to the 50mp lens every time you open the camera app (unless you keep it open constantly in the background). So you are stuck with the 8mp digital zoom lens which is okay but I want my 50mp lens to atleast have a digital zoom.Coming from a OnePlus 6 with notification LED, I really did not realize how good a feature that LED is. I miss it a ridiculous amount which is hilarious and saddening at the same time. Downloaded an app for the always on display to mimic but it just isn\'t the same and does drain battery.Overall, a really good phone. More phone than most people need these days. It isn\'t a ""flagship killer"" but it definitely is worth the money, especially when there is an offer on.And also as an FYI, the phone does come with its own clear OnePlus case (actually a decent case, see myself using it until it\'s properly worn out) in the box which isn\'t advertised. Would be nice to know this before ordering a seperate case to just end up returning after opening the box.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'ismail M.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 21 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Amazing super mobile phone\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MrR', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 23 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'Muy buen móvil, llevo años con One Plus y así seguiré, el mes pasado me he comprado el 12 y brutal\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MRicardo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 19 August 2023', 'Review Body': 'La pantalla encendida se come rapidamente la bateria\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fanny', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 10 August 2023', 'Review Body': ""Vous cherchez un compagnon qui vous accompagne dans votre quotidien, pas après pas, jour après jour...

For example chips around the casing and a scratch across one rear camera. After knowing this id personally opt for the excellent.Also the refurbishment process is significantly lacking - the phones vibration motor rattles and the phone can feel a little bit loosely put together just not as premium as I'm sure it would feel straight from Samsung.The front facing camera is also badly scratched and appears foggy when being used - it also doesn't focus properly.I would like to return this but have been warned by Amazon about my high level of returns - rather not coincidentally all refurbished phones.Amazon really need to up their quality control on these as it has been awful for years.All in all you get most of the experience but it just doesn't feel quite so premium.

It has an amazing battery life, screen, responsiveness and charging speeds that still amaze me.Being able to charge my phone at an absurd rate to 100% and then also getting at least six hours of screen on use despite the most suboptimal scenario (5g, High refresh rate and display settings maxed) is a game changer and quickly dispels any concerns about the lack of wireless charging.I can't fault the phone for it's beefed up and tactile vibration feedback, sound quality and display quality. But now for the downsides.The software is snappy out of the box but then does feel a little clunky or unresponsiveness randomly. This, I believe, is down to how the phone starts to learn which apps you use frequently, which ones it needs to not keep in memory and general system optimisations.Remedying this is simple enough, do some research into settings to turn off like ram boost, animation timing and other things to keep it feeling snappy.Comign from an older oxygen os version I feel they have lost a lot of the efficiency. So much so that there isn't a huge amount of responsiveness difference between this and my old one plus 7 pro. I however, welcome the amazing battery life that the 8 gen 2 offers and yes it will handle pretty much everything without slow down.For longevity I went with the larger ram and storage version. Just because 12 gb of ram is ideal to keep pretty much any reasonable amount of apps in memory (no power user can really multitask that much on a phone).The other major major downside is how uneasy you feel holding this phone without a case. Soemthing about the ergonomics and glass back make this so slippery. Just resting in your hand it slips, I had to scavenge some grip tape for the few days I didn't have a case just because of this.So definitely get a case and that's then completely resolved.Cameras. Another one that one plus haven't made huge leaps in. They've instead delegated much of the quality to in built filters and ai processing. Which maybe fine but the raw ability of the camera has to stand alone to produce reliably good, share worthy images. Something that they actually had done really well on op7.The overall verdict. It's a buy at this price and represents unbeatable value without compromise. Overall I am very happy with it. It's short comings for me could be fixed is subsequent software updates. But as we all know we can't rely on one plus to deliver efficiencies but thank fully can rely on them to support android updates - however well or badly they are implemented.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mohsen', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best phone on the market right now', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023', 'Review Body': ""October 2023 update:After using this phone for 3 months, I have to admit that photo and video quality is so mediocre, specially in low light conditions. Battery also has not been as good as expected and I feel it is degraded over time.------------------------------------------I just had to share my thoughts on this amazing phone! First off, the battery life is just mind-blowing. I can go through my entire day without worrying about charging it constantly. It's a game-changer for sure!I've heard some people comparing it to Color OS, but honestly, it's Oxygen OS and is packed with awesome features. The split-screen functionality using the side bar is just so intuitive and easy to use, much like Samsung's One UI.It doesn't break the bank like the Galaxy S23 Ultra does! Why pay more when the OnePlus 11 offers almost everything you need at a fraction of the cost?Also with a promise of 4 years of updates, OnePlus has really won me over. It's even longer than what Google Pixel offers, and that's saying something (if you ever keep the phone for 4 years!)There's no wireless charging or IP68 rating, but that's not a big deal for me. The 100W charging (UK) is insanely fast, so I never worry about running out of juice. As for the IP68 rating, who really takes their phone fully submerged?!All in all, the OnePlus 11 has been an absolute delight to use. It ticks all the right boxes for me - long-lasting battery, impressive OS features, and a reliable camera. Plus, it saves me some serious money compared to other flagship phones. It's definitely a choice you won't regret.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Chris', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great all round phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very well made phone.

They did everything I wanted them to but my S9+ was nearly 5 years old and on its last legs and I refuse to pay £1000 for a phone that I can't plug my headphones into or get expandable storage which limits you to Xperia and the odd Chinese made phone.I have been pleasantly surprised at how capable this phone is.What I like:The headphone jack - messed with a few settings and was happy with the sound output in the endExpandable storage - which seems to work well with the Google files appThe battery can easily last 2 days in this - sometimes I have gone for 3 days without a charge. Although I must say its not exactly the fastest charging phone I have ever had but I wonder if it might not have better battery longevity as a result.This phone is very light in comparison to my last 2 Galaxy phones - I quite like the extra thickness. Makes it more pleasant to hold.I like that the screen is flat and not curved at the edges - I can get full coverage from the screen protectorWhat I am satisfied with:The screen is quite satisfactory even if it isn't AMOLED quality.The 21:9 screen ratio does have its appeals - most video is in 16:9 but for scrolling through messages or reading the taller screen does have advantages. I could see this phone being really comfortable for people with smaller hands or less strength in their wrists as some of the phones these days have gotten so big.The stock android is quite responsive - I have yet to catch the phone really laggingThe connectivity - wifi, 4G/5G, hotspot, bluetooth and GPS have all worked very well - I speedtested the 5G one morning and was able to pull over 100Mb/s down! This phone gets a similar signal to any other phone I have owned.The dual speaker sound output is quite satisfactory - the volume key has to much range. You have to press the button a lot of times to make large changes.The main camera performs reasonably well - I would say its almost comparable with the one on my S9+ The telephoto and the ultrawide are satisfactory but remind me more of the Galaxy S4 camera in terms of image quality. I did some low light shooting and had mixed results. Had to take a few to get a good photo.I have found the fingerprint sensor to work better than I was expecting. In the last month of using it maybe a dozen times it has hesitated to unlock although I think in most cases some grease or dirt might have been on it. Only 1 night did it really refuse to unlock with the sensor. Not sure why.What I don't like:So far the one thing that grinds my gears - I don't like the stock music app. I know Sony prefer to keep to a stock version of android but Sony also used to be in the Walkman buisness. Could you please make a music app comparable with what the Samsung one can do?Setting up a playlist is very cumbersome on this - every time you add a track it has to ask you to allow the playlist to be modified. The other thing that caught me out was there is no support for .wma files and I found out I have a few in my music collection from a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.I also wish this phone had a gallery app that worked as well as the Samsung one but I suppose that's a minor annoyance.Another minor annoyance but I think the headphone jack is better served being on the bottom of the phone by the charging port than on the top. The only phone I remember with this set up was my S5. Its taken a bit of getting used to.Overall I would recommend this phone. I will be happy with this for the foreseeable future for what I do with it. Mostly its for messaging, YouTube, a bit of light web browsing, music, audiobooks and taking pictures. I use it for hotspot/tethering 4 days a week as well. I haven't tried to do anything really heavy duty like gaming though.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mr. Christopher Meadows', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great upgrade from my Sony Xperia 10 II', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2023', 'Review Body': ""Bought this to replace my Sony Xperia 10 II, size seems  exactly the same but old case fits the phone but button placement is slightly different by mm . the screen quality it better, the camera is a lot better and the torch is brighter and the improved battery life is also soo good in comparison to my previous model.

It takes multiple attempts to unlock. the passcode option is unresponsive and sometimes does not register presses.

For some reason the delay an unresponsiveness seems to lead to various button presses backing up and then being carried out in succession.The home/back/tabs bar at the bottom sometimes does not appear, so off goes the screen to be unlocked again, if it works.The phone freezes about 50% of the time when unlocked with YouTube of full screen.The phone completely crashed once when I tried to turn the wifi off.

I routinely only drained around 40% of the battery a day whilst using it fairly frequently. I would watch YouTube, play games, browse the web and only need to charge every other day. The screen is decent, though the frame rate was noticeably low.You may notice this is all past tense. Unfortunately I decided to bin this phone within 6 months. There was a plethora of software issues including:- When unlocked, it takes from one, up to ten seconds before you can interact with anything. Embarrassing when you want to show a friend something or search for something. There is no consistency behind it. If the phone hasn't been used for a day or was locked less than a second ago, you still get this random delay.- The camera's quality is pretty poor. Anything moving will be blurred heavily, without fail. The pictures of us meeting our first puppy are blurred and of shockingly poor quality due to the slightly dreary light and small motions kf the pup. The ones taken on the Mrs' 5 year old Samsung were so, so much better.- If you take a photo when the phone is locked (by double tapping the power button), it sometimes won't save the photos taken. There is no consistency behind it. Some pictures are fine, others randomly in a batch of photos taken at the same time are lost.- When unlocked, it would occassionally think the lock screen was still active, so I would have to put my passcode in when the rest of the phone is active behind it. Putting my password in would freeze the screen, requiring a full reset.- Wifi reception was poor. I had three phones next to one another at the end of the house playing a YouTube video on high quality. This phone, the 5 year old Samsung and a 10 year old Huawei. The last two worked no issue, but this one kept dropping out of Wifi and could only just play at the worst quality.

I’ve gone two full days without plugging it in, which is perfect for long hikes or those marathon work sessions. Built to handle rough conditions, the Blade 10 is both tough and dependable. I’ve dropped it on rocks and exposed it to the elements, and it’s come through without a scratch. Thanks to its IP68/IP69K rating, it’s safe from water, dust, and shocks.The display works well for watching videos, but it could use a bit more brightness for outdoor settings. The cameras do a decent job of capturing moments, though they might not be as high-end as those on flagship models. The dual SIM slots are super handy for juggling work and personal calls on one device.All in all, the DOOGEE Blade 10 is more than just a smartphone; it’s a trusty partner that can tackle tough situations.

Seller pointed us to a link on you tube to change language to English, however this was of little use as we couldn't even get to the part on settings where we could do this. After a lot of faffing about for a very annoying hour or more had to use russian translate on computer to understand what was on the phone screen and work it out from there. Eventually we were able to change the language to English and set the phone up. If the seller knows  these phones are set in Russian it would have been useful to state this is the description or provide instructions with the phone on how to get past that first page to change the language. If we'd known it was set up in Russian we wouldn't have bought it. It's the first time we have bought a mobile from an Amazon seller and after the problems of setting up, it's unlikely we would buy another this way again. The having to try and translate form Russian to English before you could do anything is a real problem and think it should have been made clear in the description that this was the case.

È sempre possibile inserire una Micro SD per fare un mare di foto e video.Non l\'ho testato con videogiochi ad elevato consumo di risorse ma credo che un telefono sotto i 200 euro non debba essere usato come un PC da gaming.Usato con accortezza, la batteria dura anche 3 giorni, che si riducono a 2 o poco più di 1 giorno se fate tante foto e video, o se usate intensivamente i social network.Una nota di merito va alla fotocamera: sebbene 48 megapixel sul minuscolo sensore di un telefonino comportino per forza di cose una precisione e una dinamica ridotta, le foto vengono molto bene. Se poi sapete regolare ISO, WB ed esposizone EV in modalità PRO, potrete creare scatti ancora migliori. In modalità Fotocamera e a 12 megapixel, l\'HDR armonizza parecchio le luci e le ombre. Certamente non compete con una vera fotocamera o una refler, ma sul fronte ""foto"" questo telefono è abbastanza rispettabile. I video anche, HD o Full-HD, sono buoni, anche se non come quelli di una vera videocamera.Per i più pignoli, posso dire che a 48 megapixel forse la nitidezza è un po\' forte, ma se avete un fotoritocco potete ammorbidire leggermente le foto (effetto Blur al minimo) e renderle più naturali. Provate a fare delle foto a qualche fiore, ingrandite e capirete meglio il concetto.Giudizio molto positivo!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': ""Client d'Amazon"", 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 15 December 2022', 'Review Body': ""Bon portable d'entrée de gamme, mémoire limitée mais place pour cette sd.

It is very cheap for a mobile phone and it does the basics (calls, texting, web access) ok (see cons).2. The screen is bright enough to work with in all light and responsive to touch even with a screen protector on.3. The fingerprint scanner on the power button works fine and I have had no issues with it.4. It doesn’t come with a lot of bloatware installed.  Just Spotify (uninstallable), Duck Duck Go (uninstallable), Youtube Music and My Device by HDM (a device management app that just hangs when I run it).Cons1. It is a very slow phone.  Even opening Chrome and searching the internet can take a frustrating amount of time and takes much longer than my personal phone (a Google Pixel 6a).  I couldn’t imagine running any games on this or doing anything that is CPU intensive.  In short, the performance makes it very annoying to use.2. The stock operating system UI isn’t great.  The spacing of the icons on the home screen meant I couldn’t layout the apps the way I normally would on my personal phone.  Also, there is no option to adjust this.  I ended up installing Nova Launcher so that I could adjust the grid size and icon size to get the layout I wanted.3. When the phone is on speaker mode, the speaker is very quiet so you must hold it near to your ear to hear to caller.  This makes speaker mode pointless.4. The phone has occasionally lost calls, i.e. it just drops out/hangs up.  I cannot 100% say this is down to the Nokia, but I don’t get this on my personal phone and haven’t experienced it previously on other phones so I have my suspicions that it is the Nokia that is at fault.  Example: I Just had a call whilst typing this and when I went to hang up there was a message saying “call app not responding” and I couldn’t hang up.  This should not happen on a telephone.OverallI can’t strongly recommend this phone as a basic device for calls and surfing the internet due to the call issues and the slow performance I have experienced.  Given that those are the most basic functions you would want from a smartphone, I can’t imagine this phone would be much use to anyone unless price is the single most important factor when buying a phone.  If you want a solid ""workhorse"" (i.e. it just works and performs adequately) then this is not the phone to buy.\nRead more'}]",31.48148148148148,B0BZDXJ18X,https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0BZDXJ18X,4g

I didn't have much luck with the Samsung brand as every phone I've had off them has been a waste of money. I then went on to buy a Windows phone when they were first released, which was also a big mistake as the phones they produced came nowhere near close to the standards of android and iOS devices. With little money and patience, I decided to buy a cheap 'budget phone', a Cubot Note S. The Cubot phone was amazing, definitely the best phone I had ever owned up to then. However, being the idiot that I am, I unfortunately dropped the phone in the bathtub a year after buying it and that was the end of that. When shopping for a new phone, I decided that I would stay with Cubot as the first phone I had off them was unbelievable for the £80 I spent. However, I did want an upgrade, and after a little looking around, I decided to buy the Cubot R9. Now, the R9 was disappointing to say the least. It did have some cooler features compared to the Note S, but the performance was quite bad and let the phone down. I kept the R9 for 7 months before I decided to buy yet again, another phone. The R9 was getting really laggy and slow, the screen appeared to be water damaged from what I am guessing was caused by leaving it in the bathroom whilst the shower was on with the steam. My first thought was to purchase another Note S as the last one I had was the best phone I had owned, however to my surprise, Cubot no longer manufacture them. So I tried looking for another cheaper phone from Cubot but the cheapest ones I could find were £100+. Again, I kept shopping around until I found this phone, the doogee X60L. I'm so glad I found this phone, and I think it is now the best phone I have ever owned. The performance is great and really fast. I haven't got any games downloaded however, so doing so may slow it down a little. I have downloaded all the social media apps, along with YouTube and outlook ect. The picture quality is also amazing. Videos play smoothly. And the camera! Let me tell you, it may not be the best camera compared to more expensive phones, but it is definitely the best camera I've ever had on a phone! It is really sharp and can zoom well. It is also good at night when it's abit darker. The keyboard words excellent also, my previous R9 didn't have the best keyboard so this is a godsend. The finger print however, doesn't work in 0.1 seconds like advertised though. Don't get me wrong, it works really fast and is the main way I unlock my phone, but it could be faster, but for the price... I'm not complaining. The case that comes with the phone is also quite stylish, it is protective and also keeps the shape to the phone unlike some other brands (looking at you Cubot). The overall style of this phone is great, the doogee logo is small and unnoticeable on the back, and it doesn't have other writing on the back like other cheap phones do, this also makes the phone look expensive.  Now, this phone may be great, but it does come with some flaws like every phone does. Firstly, although being loud, the speaker quality isn't the best, this doesn't bother me as I use earphones more likely than not. But for somebody who uses their phone speaker alot, this may not be the best choice for you. Secondly, the screen protector that comes with the phone isn't already on the phone when unboxing. I was scared about putting it on incase I messed up but it was really easy. It would be better if it was already attached though. But again, for the price... Who's bothered. I have to keep reminding myself that this phone was £70 because I would expect it to be £150+. Finally, this isn't really a flaw as I'm used to it with owning cheap phones and it doesn't bother me, but, the headphone jack and the charging hole are both placed on the top of the phone. Apart from these things, there's really nothing else wrong with the phone.I hope my review of this phone helped you make the decision to purchase it or not.

The A51 is a very fast, responsive and great phone to use. Moving stuff from my old phone to the A51 was relatively straight forward with the Smart Switch app.I've found the significantly extra inbuilt storage of the A51 to be great, though once I'd transferred the 16gb of the J3 data across the A51 had already used nearly 40gb of storage; this must have been due to the in built stuff and functionality of the A51. Thankfully the mico SD card slot works well and I've been able to load the music from my computer to the SD card on the phone via a usb cable.The A51 is very quick in loading apps and data and whilst it is a new concept for me I really like the biometrics finger scan. This makes it a lot easier to unlock the phone and log in to password secure apps without having to constantly type in or remember passwords.From a personal preference point of view, the phone is a little bigger than what I'm used to or comfortable with. It has already fallen out of my pocket. This was a compromise I knew I was making since I saw the dimensions of the phone on Amazon before I bought.

I have added all the apps that I need day to day (including my online banking app) and, while the smartphone aspect is slow, it does the job.

It is not a senior phone. It is not a smart phone. The screen is small and bright enough for me (weak sight). You can use a variety of keyboards, on screen, and physical. Slow typing but you also have the option of speech to text when appropriate. Battery is small and will drain fast if you use it for social media.This phone is a rugged phone, and mainly for phone calls which is excellent for this purpose. You have messages, Wattsapp, email, weather, instagram and all Google basic apps, etc… very configurable and you can have multiple screens with different apps (widgets) to suit your needs. Loud enough, clear speech. Signal is reliable, wifi is reliable, BT is reliable (connects to the car fine and download all contacts and make phone calls). Connects to |Android smart watches just fine. Tethering really good and fast when there is a signal.  The external screen gives you the basic, signal, wifi, battery, BT. Depending on your apps, it can put notifications on your external screen such as weather.I have been using it heavily. With phone calls and occasional texts. Battery last 1.5-2 days. Social media apps drain the battery. Maps works well. I use it solely as a communication device with occasional use of location. All myonline activities, such as banking and social media I use my mini tablet which always go with me which has bigger and brighter screen. Cameras are adequate for quick snapshots  and video calls. So far it never let me down. It actually cut down on my social media pings. Heavy and solidly built as advertised. I never put phones on my pocket, I use a sling bag for the tablet and phone, and other accessories such power bank, cables, water bottle, etc.Recommended if you want to cut down on social media, give yourself time to get used to it and specially to the keyboard.

I've been left frustrated a number of times because parking apps only partially work on this phone. On certain screens there is just no way to press enter. In the ever decreasing cashless society this has caused more than one gamble with not paying for parking.Messanger:- I can receive messages, but there seems to be no way to reply.Browsing:-Don't bother.. it's about as good as those early colour screen phones with access to basic internet. Too small/slow and difficult to read/click to be useful for anything other than very basic checks.Verdict:-All in all I like the phone. I like the idea of a simpler life with less distraction. But in reality we just do not live in that world anymore. I've found myself picking up my now simless iPhone daily for checking opening times, sorting car tax or transferring money. I find I'm persevering with this phone but in todays world it just adds anxiety by a different flavour.

It\'s *just* smart enough that it will run the few apps I need (bank app, MFA, email) while otherwise working like an old dumb phone.But this is no dumb phone.  I can do just about everything I could do on my old rectangle with this.  Yeah, it\'s a little slower, the screen is smaller, and you have to type things out in tap/T9, but the latter two are features as far as I\'m concerned.The great thing about this phone is that, if I need to, I can do anything I could do with my old phone, but it\'s *just* annoying enough that I don\'t want to make a habit out of it.If you\'re a social media addict, this phone is not for you.  (Again, a feature from my view).  If you\'re looking to downsize to something that\'s not a time/attention suck but can\'t give up a few necessary apps, this is definitely for you.Pros:- Great for digital detox while still allowing access to apps you have to have- Feels way more comfortable in your hand compared to the boring, cookie-cutter rectangles- Screen is surprisingly crisp and readable for being portrait-oriented VGA.  (480x640)- Browsing the web is surprisingly snappy and fluid (used FF mobile and Chrome)- The programmable key can be used to toggle the flashlight- Good call quality.  Supports VoLTE and VoWiFI (at least it does on T-Mobile)- Solid build, water resistant (haven\'t tested), and durable- Physical keys- Has GPS, and map apps work- Most apps seem to just work even though this is Android Go instead of vanilla Android. The few apps that didn\'t work just didn\'t work correctly on the small screen (most apps scaled just fine).- WiFi hotspot works (may be carrier dependent; my plan allows it).- Supposedly unlockable bootloader.  I\'m buying a second one of these to experiment with custom ROMS; hopefully a newer version of Android can work since these come with, and are stuck at, Android 11.- Minimal bloatware.  I disabled pretty much all of the default/Google apps and replaced them with better alternatives from F-Droid.  The only pre-installed app that cannot be disabled (without rooting, anyway) is the T-Mobile app.Meh:- Speaker is just okay.  You\'d think with the space available it would be a little better.  Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to write home about.- The default Google apps aren\'t really optimized for the small screen.  Google Maps, in particular, with its ridiculous amount of clutter was frustrating to use (granted, it\'s become frustrating to use even on a larger phone).  Installed Organic Maps from F-Droid, and problem solved.  GPS seems accurate and even works indoors.Cons:- Camera is not great.  It\'s a little better than the cameras on flip phones of yore, but don\'t expect anything like you\'re used to with even the worst smartphones.  It\'s basically an afterthought.  If you\'re in broad daylight, they\'ll probably turn out okay.  If you\'re inside without full illumination, you\'re better off committing the moment to memory than trying to capture it with this.- Dead end device.  Bullitt, the manufacturer of these, left the phone market in early 2024.  All CAT phones were made by them, and these are the last of them.  It has two updates (which it should check for during initial setup), but after that, it\'s stuck in time on Android 11.  Which is really sad because I love this thing, and it\'s truly one of a kind.- Programmable key is limited in what it can be programmed to do.  It\'s also not recognized by the KeyMapper app.  Long pressing it can do one of a few pre-programmed actions or launch an app. Double-clicking it can do a bit more, but that is the only action which can turn on the flashlight, so I leave it on that.- Outer screen is very low resolution and sometimes the indicators are cropped off.  Also, sometimes the outer screen will show a really tiny, low-res version of the inner screen when you close the phone (will \'reset\' to the proper status display if you press a volume button or the programmable button).- The default launcher does not allow adding web apps to home screen.  I thought this was an Android Go limitation at first, but after replacing the default launcher with a different one, that functionality became available.- The default T9 keyboard annoyingly does not remember the last mode you had it in.  I tend to use tap mode for most things, but it always defaults to T9 English despite showing ""Abc"" mode.  Replaced that with Traditional T9 from F-Droid.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Helena', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on 13 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Lamentablemente la primera vez que recibí el aparato el micrófono no servía y lo tuvimos que devolver.Lo volvimos a comprar y llegó muy rápido y funciona perfectamente.

Per essere piu comprensibile, ho cercato di suddividere la recensione nei punti principali e quelli che probabilmente piu interessano a chi si appresta ad acquistare questo prodotto.📸\xa0FOTOCAMERA 📸\xa0Grande sorpresa per questa fotocamera, che ha in corpo 50Mp, e per un telefono da circa 200 euro non era così scontato l’inserimento di una tale capacità. La fotocamera principale è dunque buona per la maggior parte degli utenti, con colori che rispecchiano la realtà (Se usate sopratutto l’HDR) e che hanno una buona qualità complessiva in quanto a nitidezza.Non il massimo da editare, ma chiaramente chi compra uno smartphone di questa fascia non credo abbia intenzione di lavorare su foto e quanto connesso. Non troppo positiva invece l’esperienza con la camera frontale, che nonostante sia di 8Mp ha molte criticità. Foto non perfettamente a fuoco, immagini chiare e ogni tanto anche qualche chiusura improvvisa (ma questo dipende dal sistema operativo).C’è anche una modalità macro da 2Mp f-2.6 su cui però devo dire che ci sono una serie di criticità. Detto questo, il fatto che comunque ci sia è comunque un plus per la fascia di prezzo dello smartphone. In condizioni di luce estrema il risultato sarà anche discreto, di sera praticamente pessimo (o comunque senza una adeguata illuminazione esterna).🌈\xa0SCHERMO 🌈I 6,5 pollici sono comunque un buon taglio, molto comune veramente sopratutto se parliamo di Note (anche delle altre marche). Non compre la totalità dello schermo, ci sono infatti i classici bordi neri lungo tutto il perimetro. Nella parte bassa e in quella alta sono maggiormente evidente. Niente comunque di insostenibile da sopportare a mio avviso.Lo schermo ha una risoluzione 720*1600 HD+ quindi diciamo che anche qui si evidenziano alcune criticità soprattutto nei colori. Non troppo alta la luminosità, che in condizione di estrema luce (sotto il sole, al mare ad esempio) inizia a dare qualche problemuccio. Non vi aspettate nulla, ma comunque potete fruire di contenuti video abbastanza tranquillamente, ma senza troppe pretese.Il touch risponde, ma se iniziare a metterlo in difficoltà, comunque crascia o si blocca. In condizioni ‘tranquille’ il touch risponde bene, ma messo in difficoltà allora vi farà patire. Situazione che comunque dipende dal SO e che viene influenzata anche dalla quantità di memoria che si occupa in quel momento.\U0001faab BATTERIA \U0001faabAspetto tra i piu positivi della recensione è indubbiamente la batteria. Un 4400mAh che vi farà arrivare a fine giornata senza troppi problemi. Chiaramente molto dipende sempre da come si usa lo smartphone (quindi non aspettatevi tre giorni di carica se guardate 15 ore di video al giorno), ma in linea di massima - con un utilizzo normale, tra social, musica, chat e video - la giornata la copre bene.Con la luminosità automatica, riesce a fare un bel risparmio di carburante, così come la chiusura delle App attive. Con un po’ di accortezza questa batteria vi sorprenderà (sempre parlando di un prodotto di fascia bassa). Si può caricare tramite un classico USB-C, e quindi sia a casa che in movimento con un powerbank. Non ci sono altri tipi di carica intelligente (peccato).ALTRI ASPETTI E CONCLUSIONI ➡️\xa0A tutto questo aggiungo che all’interno della confezione c’è anche una cover in plastica, nulla di fantastico ma è comunque un plus e non dovete impazzire cercando una cover che si adatti a questo smartphone, che diciamo non è proprio comunissimo e nemmeno si trova facilmente in commercio. Non c’è invece una pellicola protettiva per lo schermo.Nella confezione troviamo anche il suo cavo e relativo caricatore. La confezione non è per nulla male, così come in generale il suo packaging.Ma per chi è pensato questo smartphone? Secondo me è principalmente adatto a due fasce d’età: agli anziani e ai giovanissimi. Sono chiaramente persone ‘poco esperte’ e quindi uno smartphone come questo può essere una buona soluzione entry level, per iniziare a spendere poco ed avere comunque una buona qualità complessiva.Ci sono tutte le funzioni principali, anche lo schermo è abbondante, quindi non è mal pensato per un pubblico anziano che richiede uno schermo capacitivo o per i piccoli che usano il cellulare magari per guardare i cartoni o video in genere. Appunto anche può essere un telefono da lasciare ai figli magari per la scuola, un primo approccio agli smartphone.Sembra anche abbastanza resistenti agli urti, oltre che ai liquidi, aspetti quindi interessanti per chi cerca un telefono resistente ma senza troppe pretese. Sta a circa 160 euro su Amazon, devo dire un prezzo molto buono per quel che è il prodotto, che non mi ha deluso per niente in relazione alla sua fascia di appartenenza ‘bassa’.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Roberto Buonanno (Keledan)', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 13 July 2023', 'Review Body': 'Mi è piaciuto subito il design.

She had never really used mobiles before. We got her a few over the past few years that she tried to use but couldn’t get used to them and they got stuck in a drawer. This one though, she got used to within a few days. She loves it. As someone who still uses the landline with no caller display and no digital phone book, she still gets excited that she doesn’t have to get out her address book and look up numbers, because now they’re in her mobile. It’s a great quality device, and it also gives us peace of mind as a family because she is in her 90s now so having a mobile that she can keep on her to ring someone in an emergency rather than struggling to reach the landline is comforting to us , and we’ve setup the emergency button on it too, which sends a few of our family members an instant text saying the emergency button was pressed, and then it automatically round-robin calls us while putting her mobile on loudspeaker so we can speak directly to her in an emergency. Excellent value for money . I can’t speak so much for the features, it’s a pretty simple device, but the emergency button feature is great (although I would say that it’s a bit difficult to configure that button, for a device that’s targeted to the elderly). It’s a good size phone, with good sized buttons and text on the display, and the battery lasts a solid few days.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Penny R', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The first one was a dud, battery would not charge', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2024', 'Review Body': 'Bought for an older relative, very good design, simple to use.

Battery life is strong, camera not the best resolution but adequate 13MP front camera, never had quad lens set before so looking forward to testing this out. Screen bright and we'll pixelated. Applied Microsoft launcher as A60 didn't alpha-order apps. Ram and ROM was selling point for me, allows quick loading and using, with ability to store so many - previous phones ran out of room so quickly. Dual SIM, though if you want to use memory card then this uses up one SIM slot, find this odd as had phone that had separate slot for memory card. Not tried added security features, too old and antisocial to be at risk from muggers I hope. Only upto 4G so beware if you want 5G. Shocking surprised that is Android 10, not listed 9.

Regardless if you receive a text from AT&T saying this phone does not work on their network, it is incorrect. I have no clue about Verizon and T-Mobile networks. But I would assume it probably works? Don\'t even worry about the description saying this is a GSM only phone if you live in the USA. GSM/CDMA is mostly long gone. Expect to only be using 4G LTE in the USA anyways.So if you purchase this phone inside the USA and use it on AT&T with an AT&T SIM, you will notice that everything works except for calling. This is because the phone defaults to having VoLTE disabled. AT&T is a VoLTE calling only network. So enable VoLTE in Settings > Connections > VoLTE (check photos).Aside from the cellular fiasco, the phone is a great digital detox phone. This phone has an internet browser but it is very limited. Expect days of battery life with receiving texts and calls. The phone allows for a decent amount of customization. I strongly suggest to watch several videos on this phone if you want to get the most out of it. This phone comes with some extra games which I wasn\'t able to figure out how to uninstall them. But other than that, there was no bloatware.This is a good cheap phone that I have been able to get working in the USA for AT&T. HOWEVER, This phone only is able to utilize LTE bands 2 and 5 (about 50% of the network\'s available bands by coverage) for the AT&T network. I have not noticed any significant cellular performance problems even while driving long distances, but I cannot guarantee the same for you. This phone does not have any other radios besides its 2G-4G cellular radio. So no Bluetooth. I don\'t believe you can play music off of it except for the built-in FM radio receiver. It pairs well with the SanDisk Clip Jam MP3 player.I like it. For $50, I am satisfied. Just note the vertical viewing angles on the display suck (check image). However the horizontal viewing angles are good.UPDATE #1: I began having issues with VoLTE calling on AT&T. When I called certain people, the VoLTE call would not pass any voice. The call would ring and initialize when the person (or I) answered, but then it would hang and drop after 10 seconds of no voice. I fixed this issue by using a T-Mobile sim card (through Tello, great deals for low data rate plans). T-Mobile, so far has fixed all of the calling issues. T-Mobile even allows VoLTE on 4G as well. I have been able to use this phone with 2G on T-Mobile, but it seems like 2G support is ending in April 2024.Also, adding custom ringtones can be done. To do so, make sure the music file is in .WAV format and place it in the ""Audio"" folder when your phone connects to your PC. The phone also supports MIDI files if you so desire.Aside from this, I have encountered some bugs in the S30+ firmware. Such as: the screen staying on long past the screen sleep timer, the phone deregistering from the cell network and downgrading to 2G while strong connectivity (it reconnects after 30 seconds to 1 minute or so). These are minor bugs and do not happen often. But I still like the device. So far, I have not discovered how to (if possible) to update the firmware if Nokia even releases updates to these devices (which they should).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'وجدي حسين', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on 6 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'صغير جدا وخفيف\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Andy', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 22 June 2024', 'Review Body': 'Just got my order 100% genuine product .\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Christine maloney', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 26 October 2022', 'Review Body': 'Pour le prix son et construction bon.

Do I care? No. Will you? Depends on if you are obsessed with having the latest version of the OS as the latest on this is Android 10.As for performance, I got the snapdragon version of this phone and it easily runs Genshin Impact as long as you don't go too crazy with the graphics settings and it has run any other game that I've thrown at it perfectly including Minecraft, Nier Reincarnation, Honkai Impact and an open source osu! client (S Pen came in very handy here). Emulation of Nintendo Wii games via the dolphin emulator produced a playable result with only a few stutters here and there.As for the cameras, they are of a high enough quality for me as I don't use any of the 100x zoom lenses or 8K recording that newer flagships have. I don't really buy a phone for cameras as I only really use the camera in Snapchat.Battery life is a decent 7 hours of my typical screen on time (TikTok, a few light games, etc) meaning I can easily get through the entire day on a single charge. When gaming on it, the battery lasts and average of 3-4 running Genshin and around 5-6 hours in Nier. If you do find yourself low on power, a 15 watt fast charger is included meaning you can go from 20% to 50% in around 25-30 minutes.As for storage the 128GB isn't quite enough for me as Genshin uses over 30GB now but the phone also includes a Micro SD Card slot which means you can drop in a 512GB card and have more than enough space for everything you'd ever need on this phone.Lastly the unlock methods are fingerprints or iris scanning (similar to face id). I have both set up but have found the fingerprint scanner to be faster and more reliable.I've had my Note 9 for nearly a year now and it still serves me well to this day. I highly recommend this phone for anyone that is looking for a bargain as I was able to nab mine for only £250 and it still feels just as high quality and responsive as any other flagship from Samsung.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gadgetonomy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Refurbished product that looks brand new', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this as a second phone and for a bit of nostalgia as I owned this model in 2019.

Battery life is also surprisingly good for a 5yr old phone.This was a flagship phone when it was launched but it does show its age with the camera (still good though) and the rear mounted fingerprint reader. The screen is bright and vibrant but is a lot smaller than my behemoth Galaxy s24 Ultra! However it has the iris scanner which I love! It works really well. And the S-Pen is still a very useful feature for me.The only issue is that the security updates ended in 2023, so I would be extra careful about what apps you have on it.

What a mistake I did.Now my work is driving around west to north London area ( Heathrow->Luton->central London area, 12 hour shifts ) so I need good coverage.Straight from beginning signal started to play( no signal, no internet at random places)3 days later I brought it back for another ""new Note9"" . Same issue.  I was confused as at that time they were building 5g towers plus lockdown and that seller Was very persuasive telling me that it\'s a network issue. I even changed network ( to O2 ) to match up network strength  with my work phone . Unfortunately I cannot use mobile data in my work phone for private purposes so still not sure . Months have passed and even my friends and family started to call me on my work phone as I Was always out of reachExcept network issue ( which is main purpose of the phone anyway ) I loved this phone, as other reviews say all apps run smoothly, wi-fi ok etc.  ****  Finally now ( May 2021 ) I typed in Amazon ""Note9"" to find out that Amazon does refurbished phones with one year return policy ( obviously there is no need to wait whole year to find out if phone works well or not)What a relief! Back to youtube, what\'sapp, drone flying, audiobooks, trip/sightseeing recording, and even film making app ( kinemaster) all runs smooth and fast! Please be aware that I\'m not gaming fan and I don\'t play games so don\'t know that, but I travel a lot and video/photo is still so good you cannot guess if it Was taken by Samsung S21 or my Note9  fresh and fast Straight from the box ! Phone Was like newfor £275 what a good choice!Now theese high street sellers are already crying for customers as everyone buys on Amazon now ( I feel sorry for them) even though the one who sold me  my first Note9 does not buy phones over from walk-in people, only from retailers ( friend of mine tried to sell him his phone ) it is proof that companies like Samsung send them  second grade unsold phone with problems.

This one ( form Amazon ) is working and looking like brand new in fact I\'m writing this review using it.So if you are like me ->not playing games, using phone for WhatsApp, youtube, audible, Facebook, workshift callendar, but don\'t want to spend £1000 or more for flagship go ahead and buy it in here! You always can send it back and get your money back.If I could find one issue I could say that battery life is slightly shorter than my high street shop Note9. but still not an issue as for what I do it lasts  all day no problem.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Zarathustra', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Flawless and awesome, for a good price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'I love galaxy notes.

This phone comes with a slim fit protective case for free. Once you put the case on, the first thing you will notice is how comfortable the phone feels in your hand. It is lightweight and easy to handle for hours at a time. It's a 5G phone with Dual Sim, which not a lot of phones in Canada have. While dual sim is not useful in 2024 compared to earlier days with the popularity of e-Sims, it is still a neat option to have when travelling.The phone handles and processes very quickly without any lag, thanks to its built-in 6G of RAM and running the latest Android 13. The internal storage is 128 GB, but the great thing is it allows expansion so I have ordered a 256 GB microSD to add it to the phone.  I tested the NFC payment option and it works as advertised.  The main camera is 50 MP and creates sharp images at high quality. Night vision camera mode worked well when I tested it, although I am not experienced in night vision camera work.Now, let me get to the best part - while the phone itself is ultra slim, it comes powered with a 5000 maH battery. Given the power of the battery, the phone enjoys a very long-lasting battery life which I have really appreciated running multiple apps open and videos. The phone also stays very cool throughout heavy usage, which is markedly different versus my experience with the Pixel 7 previously with heating issues.So overall, for the price paid, this budget phone delivers excellent value for a slim design, no overheating issues, and long battery life.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'clay young', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on 16 June 2024', 'Review Body': ""First of all, set your expectations - it's a $200 unlocked phone, something that obviously isn't meant to top the charts in benchmarks or handle heavy 3D editing on the go.What's in the box: the phone, charger, USB-A to USB-C cable, and a clear protective bumper.The charger isn't anything to write home about, same with the cable, but the free bumper is pretty great.

Straszak', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'For the price? Fantastic. UPDATED: 6 months, still epic.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'My phone has three main purposes: reading (manga, news, etc), mapping & travel-oriented things (think OS maps, managing my InReach, that sort of thing), and music playback. As such, needs to have a good display, good battery life, and good-quality navigational features. As an amateur photographer, it helps to have a phone you can depend on in a pinch, e.g. if it\'s too wet to get the DSLR out, or too risky.So, with all that in mind: for the price, great phone. I only have three criticisms.The first is that the curved screen is a ridiculous gimmick that serves no purpose- you can\'t touch/use the curved edge with a screen protector on, IF you can find one that works. Only a hydrated gel screen protector will work, and they\'re not that compatible with cases- chicken and the egg. I had to buy the protector, cut it down even more to size than it already was, and only then would it fit with the case I got. I tried 5+ cases and multiple tempered glass screen protectors, only to settle for a regular TPU case and a hydrogel protector.The second is the efficiency of the phone. No phone should heat up this much during charging- that\'s called inefficiency, loss: for a person who goes on 7-8 day unsupported trips with no opportunity to recharge, that means more weight- more power banks. It will heat up without fast charging, that is a fact. In airplane mode, it will last 2 (maybe 3, if you\'re judicious with your mapping and supplement with paper maps) days. That\'s not too bad, but not the best, and it\'s all down to the fact that it burns through 20% charge just being idle throughout the day.No headphone jack, really? You couldn\'t drill a small hole and shove in a headphone jack? What a ridiculous era we\'re in.Now, the good bits:- It has great navigation (GPS, etc)- Reliable & fast UI- No ridiculous adware like Xiaomi/Apple/other phones, you can uninstall all the trashy moto apps (and there aren\'t many.)- Camera isn\'t the worst, and is great for the price- the bog pic was a ""raw"" (comes out DNG) and the viaduct a HDR straight from the camera. In terms of camera phones, the colour rendition on the photos is generally spot-on, though you may want to turn off the HDR or tone it down a bit, as it can be too much in shaded/poorly lit conditions. It isn\'t good for night photography.- Audio playback is strong, vibrant, and doesn\'t skimp on the low frequencies- bass is good.- It\'s waterproof and durable. I\'ve tested it by dropping it in bogs, dropping it in sinks, and yes, dropping it in hot tea (all three deliberately.)- It charges fast. It might heat up like mad, but it does charge fast. Not a priority for me, but something I have noticed in passing by.- It has a ""pro"" mode for photography, which does give better control in certain conditions- though the phone is limited by the camera system compared to the latest/best Huawei/Apple phones.I\'ve never been one for using a phone for photography- my DSLR will always win just by a matter of fact of functionality, ergonomics, and literally physics (something I\'m qualified to state.) But honestly, I would not hesitate to use this phone in a pinch to get an image suitable for web publication (definitely not large format print, though.)EDIT #1:In fact, on my latest trip, which I just got the phone for reliability on, the raws came out quite good- much better than my old P30 Lite (which didn\'t give RAW files.) That being said, the actual ""photos"" are AI-processed to hell and unusable. The RAW though? Look at the DNG screenshot at 1:1 that I\'ve attached- honestly not that bad for a £300 phone! £250 even!EDIT 6 MONTHS:God damn! This thing is amazing for photography. I\'ve attached some more pics. 1:1 this thing outdoes my D780 x 28-300mm (photo prudes as you wish, that\'s a killer combo I have used to print meter-wide posters.) The limit is the sensor, the lens on this is perfectly sharp! If only it had more pixels and less noise (AI Denoise helps a lot.) I\'ve thrown in a 200% zoom (yes, 200%) to exemplify the quality this can output.It really opens your horizons to have a camera you don\'t need to fish out your backpack for, you can just grab your phone and snap a pic candidly while hauling your 30 kg pack! Obviously the camera wins when you\'re being technical and composing a frame delicately, zooming in and picking out something tight, but for a quick shot that you would otherwise miss due to weather or being too tired? It\'s worth it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Elen', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great little phone for the price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Absolute bargain and at this price I knew I needed to manage my own expectations.

I did take few pictures in outdoor setting with clouds + variations in light and quality is really good.Sound is good, with Dolby Atmos and equaliser settings to your liking.Set up was easy with Moto prompting to transfer data from old phone to the new one, I used the new cable from the box to do this as over the WiFi it would be much slower. Software updates and download of applications took about 2 hours with frequent restarts required which is understandable - getting the phone up to speed with the newest version of security patches and updates.Battery life with location, data and WiFi switched on with mixed daily use (watching videos, reading articles, and also occasional screen off time) is roughly half a day thanks to 5000mAh battery. Charging from cca 30% to 100% took around 30 minutes (there is setting for rapid or optimal charge on the phone) with charger + cable provided in the box.256GB internal memory and 12GB RAM (with option to share extra from internal memory) is sufficient for regular user.There is no slot for extended memory card as it has only 1 SIM slot (I haven\'t tried to use e-SIM to see if that would then enable use of SD card).No 3.5mm headphones jack - you can buy USB-C to 3.5mm jack adaptor or use wireless headphones.As it is with other Moto phones this one also comes with Moto UI where you can set up visuals, fonts, etc.There is also a lot of Moto apps which are useful if you have smart home and lot of devices to share or screencast to.Navigation and positioning are both good.

I am impressed with the battery life, it has around 5000mAh and it performs quite well. In regards to the other specs I love Umidigi it has great phones which are not expensive with decent RAM and Storage. I inserted my Verizon Sim card and it worked, it has all the bands needed for my network. The only downside I believe will be the updates not coming in, but I won't mind in buying another phone from Umidigi next year, new with Android 14 when they release one with it. This comes with Android 13 and the performance is good, no glitches or freezes, the RAM and Display Hz is decent. I still have my Umidigi Power from 2019 and it's keeping going, so I think this G3 will last me for a long time.The design is nice. I would have rather have a matte look with that green color but the leather look is OK. The cameras design looks as an expensive phone. The quality of photos is OK, but don't expect something like a Telescope Zoom or something like that, but if you take photos in good light they should come out great. So, If you need a mid range phone with a nice fancy design at an inexpensive price go for it, you won't regret it.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'chris', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 1 August 2023', 'Review Body': 'Petit prix pour ce téléphone très performant.

Budget phone that appears to punch well above what you would expect for it\'s price point. The 6.7"" screen is clear and bright although legibility is slightly difficult in direct sunlight, although not enough to be illegible due to the large screen.Included is a case, charger (not always a given these days), SIM removal tool and a USB C cable. The case is of good quality and should be more than up to protecting the phone from scratches and the odd drop.The design of the phone is understated, with minimal bezels on the front with a teardrop for the camera. The back reminds me of an iPhone for better or worse, with a triangular camera arrangement. Speaking of the cameras they are good for the price but understandably fall short of the flagships, the zoom was particularly impressive given the lack of telephoto although the macro camera was of middling quality.Charging isn\'t especially fast, but is standard on budget phones. The 5000mAh battery easily keeps the phone going for a day or two depending how heavily you use it and the phone always felt nippy enough, although I never tried any demanding games. The fingerprint sensor also works as expected and is quick to unlock the phone.Overall I\'ve come away very impressed with this budget phone, it has everything you need including a big screen, good battery life, NFC, and decent cameras. You can get improvements in the screen, charging speed and cameras with mid range or flagship options but those often cost at least 4x times the price of the A15T so this is a right bargain at £139.99  (at the time of review, a £14 voucher was also available making this am even bigger deal).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tom', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Brilliant phone for the price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""Arrived in nice box with it's own phone case, UK charger and screen protection (on the phone). It's a good looking phone, good size and not too heavy.Sticker on back of phone was difficult to peal off and took some effort to remove the adhesive and I scuffed the screen protection in the effort to remove it.The phone uses 'DDU launcher' and has a few umidigi apps on the phone that are unverified by Google play store (umidigi app store, weather, security, browser, themes) and are unable to be uninstalled. These appear to be non-malicious after scanning. The 'security' one is quite helpful to optimise phone performance. Even so I restrict their access apart from the DDU launcher which needs permissions for the phone to work properly. Transferring from one phone to another is initially quick, but takes time to reorganise icons and logging back into apps, but this is an android issue in general.So after the initial getting used to a new phone I am very pleased. I was really disappointed with the G5 mecha smartphone and this is a huge improvement. For the price it's very quick to use, apps don't crash and so far there are very few bugs that I have come across. Screen quality seems really quite good, (consider maybe tweaking miravision settings to get a good colour). Games and videos look great and are quick to stream. Sound also seems quite good and so far no issues with call volume. The NFC is very quick and works really well. Same with the fingerprint biometrics and the hotkey function is really useful once setup. Cameras seem good, takes some getting used to. For the camera it takes time to remove the 'watermark' for each type of camera (pro, selfie, macro, wide angle ..etc) in settings tab. However, I'm so grateful to get the wide angle camera back. My partner has the A15 and loves it as well, it appears to have more storage but this seems quicker.One thing to be mindful with umidigi phones is they cannot easily be upgraded to major android releases (once on android 13 always on android 13) if this doesn't bother you, phones can easily last 2-5years. It's a brilliant phone and hopefully saves you some money.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sid', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Solid Budget Price Mobile', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nFor its price range, the Umidigi A15T is a reasonably priced smartphone with good performance.

This phone offers a lot for its price.First off, the performance is solid. It runs on Android 13 and the MediaTek Helio G95, making it smooth and fast. Whether I'm switching between apps or playing games, it handles everything without slowing down. Plus, it's energy-efficient, so the battery lasts longer. The memory is impressive, too. With 8GB of RAM (expandable to 16GB) and 128GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and files. There's also an option to add up to 1TB via a TF card, which is more than I'll ever need.The camera is another standout feature. It has a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro, and a 16MP front camera. The photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light, which is great for someone who loves taking pictures. The 6.7-inch screen is big and bright, perfect for watching videos and browsing. The resolution is sharp, and the colors are vivid, making everything look great.Battery life is excellent. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day, and the 18W fast charging is a bonus. I never have to worry about running out of power. Extras like NFC, a side fingerprint sensor, and face unlock are nice touches that make the phone easy to use.Overall, the UMIDIGI A15T is a great mid-range phone with solid performance, a good camera, and long battery life.

You can choose what action you would like for a long press or a double press.  Or, if you don\'t want to use the hot key, you can have it do nothing.  Convenient if you have a program or two that you ""always"" use.  The screen is nice and big, and has very little bezel.  Thankfully no curved glass at the edges so no mis-touches when trying to play games.  Has a decently large battery but is not heavy. While that indicates the use of a lot of plastic instead of metal in the frame, I actually prefer a lighter phone to a more-durable but much heavier phone.  Uses USB-C for charging, and there is a standard headphone port!!!Included extras: There is an attached screen protector and a decent protective case included in the box.  The case has small lips that protects the camera and screen when you lay the phone down.Camera:  Gobs of megapixels but whatever, the most important thing to me is that photos come out very well (to me, a casual user), from close-ups to low-light indoor shots to brightly-lit outdoor shots (sample photos attached).Performance:  With 8 GB of ram and a decent mid-range processor, I have not had any slowdowns, freezing, or stuttering as I play Royal Match and browse web pages.  You can use two compatible SIM cards, or one SIM card and one micro SD card to add storage space (but the 128 GB of built-in storage space is more than enough for me).  There is great LTE reception and speed.  Not 5G but then a 5G capable phone at this price point would probably have an inferior processor, less ram, and/or less storage space.  There is NFC that works properly, too.  Battery life was not good on the first charge but improved notably on the second.  Now, I get a full day with just over 40% left in the evening.Overall: Highly recommended as long as you don\'t need 5G coverage.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Roberto Matilla Augustinus', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 13 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es muy bonito, bien diseñado.

My 2013 Moto G is far better in every way. This Umidigi also did something it seems a lot of these newer cheap android phones are doing which is have a really twitchy GPS so in Google Maps it takes aaaggeeessss to find your location, it literally randomly shoots around the area you are at, sporadically. It is annoying and takes ages to get a firm lock on your. I use the GPS/Maps a lot so this was a big deal. Plus because of these stupid notches at the top of the screen its so hard to reach up with your thumb and drag down the notification bar, really how did they over look that? You have to reach all the way up to the corner not the middle, to the indent, then drag down from top corner towards the centre of the screen. VERY AWKWARD. I have to say that I gave up, listening to the speaker as it carved sores into my ears, then feeling the pain and discomfort of just holding the damn slippery, cold, heavy phone in ones hand. It put me off instantly. I am very disappointed. And I am shocked that phones have actually got worse! Or is it that peoples standards are lowering? It seems that £100 back in 2013 would get you as phone that is still superior to the budget phones costing LESS in 2020?!? So weird. Anyway the moto g locks onto my location in seconds even indoors and accurately, and the speaker sounds amazing, and its comfortable to hold, the call quality and everything is up to a certain standard.

Would happily buy from the seller again though, I'm pleased with the service.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'george m sinclair', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Faulty battery', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2023', 'Review Body': ""Adding a bit of clarity, Bought two of these phones, the first one opened had a scratch all the way down the screen but took a charge, so I decided to keep it rather than returning it as it is going to be used as a back phone. The second phone would not take a charge irrespective of the charger used, so I assumed the battery was U/S. I then laterally took the battery out and heated it on the radiator (wrapped in a towel) for 20 minutes and tried charging again - and this time the battery took a charge. Still not sure if the battery is U/S or charging circuit in the phone is intermittent, but I decided to keep the phone and cancel the return collection as this phone is also a back up phone. Point is that Amazon were excellent at dealing with this but the seller (so far) has not responded. The least they could do is respond and send a replacement battery so that I don't get caught out again!! I have therefor raised the rating from 2 stars to 3 stars for that reason; BUT I remain unsure as to when the phone or the battery may wrap up..Previous review below....Bought two of these phones, First one had quite bad scratch on screen and the second the phone failed to charge, 99% sure its the battery on the second phone is completely u/s - so much for 80% capacity. The other phone with scratch on the screen does take a charge but the battery drops from 100% to 90% in a few minutes without even making a call so I suspect that battery will wrap up soon also.

The screen displays the time and notifications in a large easy-to-read font. The side has the volume up/down buttons and a torch button.This Uleway phone features two SIM card slots, so you can use it for personal AND work calls without the need for two phones.The battery lasts a long time.

The mobile phone measures 12cm in length, 5cm wide and 1cm deep. The mobile phone comes with a USB charging lead, a plug to charge it with and an easy to follow instruction manual.I would say that this phone is ideal for an elderly person due to the size of the buttons and each button is clearly labelled so you can easily press and see them. However, the screen on the phone is tiny, to me it looks smaller that pictured in the product image. The overall size of the screen is around 3.5cm length and 2.8cm wide. The text does look big on the screen however some people with struggle to see it on such a small screen.This mobile phone is dual sim and will only take nano sized sim card, there is also the option to expand the phones memory by adding micro-SD card inside the phone. This phone has all the basic applications you would normal get with a phone such as the calendar, alarm, torch, video recording and camera. The phone also has Bluetooth and 4G internet connection. The speaker is built into the back of the phone and isn’t the best sounding quality. This mobile phone also comes with a headphone socket if you want to listen to the radio however no earphones are included with the phone.Overall, this mobile phone is very straight forward to use and ideal if you just want a phone to make calls and text with.

But I've just got bored.Ive been looking for along time at what I could find that's new and decided it would be the find x3 neo or the OnePlus 9. (OnePlus is basically oppo anyway) I'm so glad I went with this one and I'll explain why.Build Quality:build quality it great, I love the colour, I went with galactic silver and it's beautiful, I love how it changes colour depending on how the light reflects off it. It has a nice matted glass back that doesnt show fingerprints (none at all) although this does make it feel a little bit like plastic but it's better than being smudgy and ugly all the time! The phone does have a bit of weight to it but also surprisingly light for the size, but it's enough to feel premium, the craftsmenship being up there with Samsung!Display:The screen is one of the best, covered with gorilla glass 5 and a nice screen protector out the box, it has a slight curve on the edges but doesn't seem to cause any issues with accidental touches, the 90hz refresh rate is nice, obviously not up there with the 120hz powerhouses but it's definitely a win over iPhones 60hz... The colours are amazing and is a truly great panel! HDR10+  also supported.Camera:Exceptional actually, it really is a great camera, there's 4 built in but I'm not really sure what part they all play as I focus more on the standard modes, with portrait mode also being a great go to that works probably just as well as Samsung and apples offering.. not up there with pixel but it's not far off, good dynamic range, white balance and focus, everything's good and I'm really surprised by how much it impressed me!Software:This is what sold it for me, I mean it's android so.. well... It's android! and I know what to expect, but it's the other bits, the color os and oppo bits that made it for me, it's fun and different ( a good change) how long it'll last on me I don't know, but I am loving the experience! It's clean and modern, little animations here and there and features everywhere! You can also personalise it as much as you like.. now when you first set it up the standard home screen mode is a little annoying and doesn't have the app draw but after navigating round the settings I was able to change it! Talking of the settings app, this is probably my only complaint, things are difficult to find in here and navigating is a pain to say the least, nothing is where you expect it to be and it's all a bit confusing, I just stick to typing what I want into the search and let it present itself to me! It's annoying but not a turn off.So to summerise a few pros and consPros-- build quality- camera- screen- software-its differentCons-- No wireless charging- the odd stutter when doing some tasks- last year's processor- no waterproofing or dust resistance ratingOverall I'm really happy with this phone, and just thought I'd share these points with anyone thats maybe not sure on their next phone, it shouldn't disappoint!I think I might be a new oppo fan\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'J.

It seems very quick and without hesitation in everything it does.With 256GB of memory, there\'s plenty to spare even when I load up with a lot of music to play in the car.I have the silver version - which is stylish and IMHO, looks good! Overall, everything seems to be well made and sturdy. The mobile has a reasonable weight and feels good in the hand.The display and the cameras are brilliant.  Charging is amazingly rapid and the device comes with a silicon case and a ready fitted film type screen protector.The Android 11 implementation is reasonably ""vanilla"" without an overload of bloatware. What there is, can mostly be easily disabled if necessary.I used the OPPO cloning app on my old Xiaomi and remarkably all my settings, data, media files and apps transferred over rather painlessly. I\'ve not had that before! I presume life was made easier by both mobiles being on Android 11.Just one app failed to transfer - and I simply reloaded it from Google Play. I then deleted some of the Xiaomi bloatware that managed to make it across.I did have to manually set up the Home Screen in my preferred ""drawer"" mode. I also added ""File Manager +"" as it also provides seamless local network access to our home NAS/Media Server. So, I can download music and films, and upload photos etc.I have had no issues with WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth. 5G gives some amazing data transfer rates. Battery life is usually more than sufficient for me for a day.So, overall I am most chuffed! The mobile is a joy to use with performance at a par with many flagship devices. The Amazon option of 12 monthly payments make it a viable alternative to a long term agreement - with the flexibility and savings of a ""SIM Only"" contract.However, this is not a cheap device and there are a couple of small gripes:- No glass screen protectors work on this device as keyboard and fingerprint sensor sensitivity are lost rendering the mobile unusable. So, unlike me, don\'t remove the factory fitted film screen protector! I have had to replace it with a soft \'hydrogel\' one...- It appears to be impossible to lose the Google app from the home screen tabs (RH swipe). I managed to get rid of it on my Xiaomi but OPPO seem to have blocked that option. You can disable ""Discovery"" (that chews data in the background) but Google Search annoyingly remains.....- The mobile is dust rather than water-proof.- There is only a small choice of cases available - particularly wallet/flip types.Wireless charging would have been great but the rapid charge capability does compensate.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lesley M', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Australia on 13 February 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is my second Oppo and I'm very happy with my choice.

Setting up was super easy with step by step instructions. The user experience is great and smooth with no lagging. Also picture quality is super.

I would definitely recommend for anybody who might have site or hearing impairments or a neurological disorder whereby their memory perhaps , is poor or they have some difficulty in negotiating technology. The phone is reasonable size without being too large that it makes it difficult to put into a bag or pocket. The camera is reasonable although obviously not the best on the market. Battery life is generally very good obviously this depends on usage. With basic usage, I would say it would last between 2 to 3 days between recharges .

He had an old 2G phone but wanted to be able to send Whatsapp messages, something he could not do with his old phone. He is able to send short emails using my laptop and has sent Whatsapp messages using my phone and now wants to get a 4G phone. I thought the Doro 7030 would be suitable with bigger buttons and the fact that It came pre-installed with Whatsapp and was internet enabled was good. He particularly wanted to send Whatsapp messages to family and friends. The phone arrived very quickly and he was happy with the look of the phone, he liked the fact that it was a flip phone that fits easily in his hand. I read that this phone is quite easy to set up, this was not the case, it took me ages. I suppose when you are used to touch screen phones, using this type of phone can be quite tedious. Having to press each button and having to OK every action that is taken, was quite annoying. My husband was not too bothered by this so much, his main problem with this phone was having to scroll up just to read a line of text messages at a time, not being able to clearly see the whole message to read. No matter what we tried, we couldn’t access the messages clearly. He would say, with his old phone he was always able to see messages clearly. He looked forward to using Whatsapp but that was simply awful, he was not able to use it as the print was so small with the tiniest arrow to move around, you would need a magnifying glass to use Whatsapp. He became very disappointed with the phone and in the end, wasn’t interested in using it at all. I felt awful because I had suggested buying it and really thought the Doro 7030 would be the most suitable phone for him. I have now decided to return the phone because my husband has no interest in using it. I will have to get him a touch screen phone that doesn’t cost the earth.

The call quality over a 4G network is just as good as a top end smartphone as it works with networks that allow the use of HD Voice codecs.Now the not so good parts - Firstly for a tech-phobic elderly person , you\'re going to have to help them set it up. The menus and set up process can be a bit tricky to start with. Similarly it takes some getting used to the format to add numbers to the phonebook or use the SIM tool kit.The camera is, as you\'d probably expect at this price point, absolutely terrible. It\'s good enough for an ""emergency photo"" of, say, an item in a shop to send to someone, but you\'re not going to be taking family portraits with this. Similarly, the screen - while very clear and capable for text, really isn\'t for viewing snaps on. There is a media player, which is very good but the video player... well... lets just say 405 line TV was double the resolution - but, it /does/ actually play videos kindof!The battery lasts about 5-6 days here in a 4G strong signal area so ideal for my mother who forgets to charge things, and there is a headphone socket to listen to music and it has a radio built in that can play over the speaker or the headphones.Overall a great little phone for being a phone, and perhaps a useful music player, just don\'t expect it to be a iPhone or Pixel!

Large memory specifically for Calendar items  which was great for my usage.Compared with the 2024 Nokia 110 the shell is cheap plastic, wouldn't like to drop it onto anything hard, the keys are just not positive, on some you can, without trying receive the wrong info which is very frustrating. The memory on the calendar is miniscule, the camera is rubbish (why bother?)  it was advertised as  'with 4G' but has no internet connectivity (why bother?)2 Sims, it will work fine with 1 and the other ignored, quite fiddly to fit though.For the Camera you will need a (max) 32g Micro SD card, even more fiddly to fit and remove, but why bother when the camera unit is so bad.

Once opened the phone, USB to micro USB charging cable, and battery are within sealed plastic bags, and inside a bespoke card tray.I removed the back of the phone and inserted two sim cards following the instructions, and fitted the battery. The phone takes a standard sized sim card, and I used two adapters to bring my sim cards back to the standard size. I put the phone on charge and had a good read through the instructions. Due to having grown up with the introduction of this type of phone I was fairly familiar with the menu system and functions.After the phone had fully charged I tried it out, Switching between service providers is straight forward as it gives you the option on which to use when you make a call. The phone call quality is fairly basic, and really not comparable with modern smart phones, but it is acceptable for a normal conversation. I did try the Bluetooth feature with some earbuds, and that worked well giving  a better audio experience than the inbuilt phone speaker. I tried out the camera which again is fairly basic but useful if you need a quick snap.Although this is an old style phone it does come with the addition of modern features such as camera, Bluetooth, and the ability to take duel sim cards. The phone battery easily outlasts my other phones by days, and it has a good loud ring tone, which is also changeable along with being able to adjust the volume.Overall this isn’t a modern touch screen phone, and doesn’t try to be. It offers simple call functions along with adding some of the innovations of modern phones, such as a duel sim card option, camera, and Bluetooth. The call quality is basic but also acceptable with clear audio both ends.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'susan', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""For me,complicated,time doesn't seem to work,everyone I open phone time is zero,"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2024', 'Review Body': ""Doesn't keep time,needs charging regularly.SIM card in,but keeps along for SIM card??\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lucius', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A feature phone that covers the basics.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2023', 'Review Body': ""If you're looking for a basic feature phone that can make/receive calls/texts and capable of inserting two SIM cards then this phone is definitely one to consider.There exists additional features but with the exception of a few (alarm, torch and FM radio) they're mostly a token effort or of little realistic interest.You're certainly not going to be taking any flattering pictures with the camera!The user interface is mostly intuitive but there is a few occasions where you have to follow a somewhat awkward route to achieve your goal.Battery life is good with multiple day standby easily achievable.

You can fit two normal sized SIM cards and there is an additional slot for a TransFlash memory card (microSD memory card) - couldn't find the max supported size, but it works fine with a 16GB one. The supported languages are English, Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Polish. The phone is lightweight and compact (160 grams; 122/52/15 mm), works with standard GSM frequency bands (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) and it's unlocked. It is supplied with li-ion 1000mAh rechargeable battery (model: BL-5C). One of the downsides is that there is no way of attaching lanyard and normally the phone should be kept away from water in general; also - you'll have to get yourselves a charger. Another thing is that the phone I received had patches of corrosion as you can see in my last photo, but I'm guessing it's just my luck - nevertheless the phone works as intended - hence the 4-star rating.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sos', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 16 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Un coup sur deux il ne capte  pas que la carte sim est inséré dans le téléphone et ce depuis son achat.

My son uses my phone for whatsapp calls to his friends when playing on his playstation.  He's quite heavy handed (on his 4th controller) so thought this phone might solve a problem for me.First impressions, it's really nice.  The phone itself is rugged, has a nice protective case built in that looks like it could handle a decent knock without any trouble.  The screen is great, 6.5inch, nice and bright and clear, nothing to argue about there.  It's very responsive to use, not as fast as my phone (Samsung Fold 5) but not slow by any means, very nice.It can support 2 SIMS cards and a Micro SD card to improve the storage (some of the dual sim phones I've used before don't let you use the SD slot and a second SIM at the same time, this appears to have 3 slots on the hold for 2 SIMS and an SD card although I haven't tested that yet).It's IP68 waterproof which I had to google to check myself what that means.  In simple terms, the first number is the dust proof rating, 6 being the highest and the second number is the waterproof rating with 9 being the highest.  IP68 means its fully dust proof and waterproof with the exception of high pressure hot water (at least that's my understanding).  So, it should handle spillages and a quick dunk without any trouble at all.It comes with 2GB of memory but an option to increase this to 4GB total by using some of the storage as RAM (I believe that's how it works).  Mine was pre-configured as 2GB+1.5GB so 3.5GB in total.It's going to be a christmas present for my son, but I've had a couple of days playing around with it while he's in bed and I think he will be over the moon with it.So far, so good.  It's a nice phone, sturdy case, responsive enough when in use, expandable memory, dual sim and waterproof all for £110.  In all honesty, I can't find any faults with it at all, it's not going to beat my Fold 5 in terms of performance, but then again it's a fraction of the price!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Slossed_in_translation', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Sllooooooowwwwww phone but quick and attentive customer service to resolve issue.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 May 2024', 'Review Body': ""Thought this would be a good purchase going by reviews,Being able to boost storage up to 2TB was what won me over and desl offered on price.Be good for storing music for going away when there's no internet connection.The deal breaker.Hopeless with anything video related.All the apps YouTube,Instagram ,Facebook etc takes forever to play properly,(good few seconds lagging in slow motion ) you get what you pay for i spose.I paid around £100.Dissapointed as reviews seemed good.Update: was contacted by seller and given an updated phone free of charge great communication and customer service.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'danskkr', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Phone lags so much it's unusable"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2024', 'Review Body': ""It is rugged, and tough and water proof, but that's as far as the positives go.As a phone, it sucks.

And for some reason google maps always defaults to dark mode no matter what settings you change.And if you get an SD card, even a good quality one, and set it as internal memory to try and free up space to give it a little more RAM to work with, the phone stops recognising it and constantly telling you it's missing no matter how carefully you insert it.

The DOOGEE Smini is a Rugged Phone with Big Features!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'I’ve been using the DOOGEE Smini Rugged Phone for a couple of weeks now, and I’m really impressed with how much this compact device has to offer. It’s rugged, powerful, and packed with features that are typically found in larger smartphones.Perfect Size for PortabilityThe 4.5-inch QHD+ display is perfect for those who prefer smaller phones. It fits easily in my pocket and feels great in my hand, without compromising on screen clarity. Despite its small size, the display is vibrant and clear, making it enjoyable for browsing, watching videos, or using apps.Tough and DurableAs a rugged phone, the DOOGEE Smini is built to withstand tough conditions. It’s shockproof, dustproof, and water-resistant, which is exactly what I need for my outdoor activities. I’ve accidentally dropped it a few times, and it’s held up with no damage whatsoever—definitely built to last.Impressive PerformanceWith 15GB of RAM (including 8GB virtual RAM) and a Helio G99 Octa-Core processor, this phone is surprisingly fast for its size. Multitasking is smooth, and gaming performance is solid too. Plus, the 256GB storage is more than enough for all my apps, photos, and videos, and the ability to extend it to 2TB with a microSD card is a huge bonus!High-Quality CameraThe 50MP camera on this phone is fantastic! It captures clear, detailed photos even in low light, which is not something I expected from a rugged phone. The front camera is also great for video calls and selfies.Long-Lasting BatteryWhile the 3000mAh battery might seem small, I was surprised at how well it performs. The phone is optimized to be energy efficient, and I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to charge. For such a compact phone, it offers more than enough battery life.Modern FeaturesRunning on Android 13, the user interface is clean and fast. I love the additional features like Face ID, NFC for mobile payments, and GPS, which all work perfectly. The dual SIM capability is also really useful for keeping my work and personal numbers separate.Final ThoughtsOverall, the DOOGEE Smini Rugged Phone is a compact yet powerful device that doesn’t compromise on features. It’s perfect for anyone who needs a tough, reliable phone with great performance, storage, and camera quality. I highly recommend it, especially for outdoor enthusiasts or those looking for a smaller, rugged phone!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gordon Comstock', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""It's small!

The touch screen is frustratingly oversensitive near the bottom, but simultaneously frustratingly insensitive near the top, making it hard to interact with many apps. After a few weeks of use I'm pretty sure it's not just me failing to get used to it. I thought the unit itself might actually have been damaged near the top during manufacture or shipping, because the back of the case is supposed to be black but is actually iridescent blue in the top left corner, so I wondered if it might've been heat- or UV-damaged. But, I saw photos in another person's review that seem to indicate that this is standard.In general, the phone *looks* rugged but actually feels sort of brittle and fragile. The buttons in particular feel a bit loose in their casing. It's thick and heavy but still feels like I ought to put a case on it if I want to actually be safe to take into rough terrain.I *absolutely adore* that this phone is small enough to fit into my pocket, which is a rarity these days. However, the specific choice of dimensions is odd and decreases the usability of the phone. The screen is tall and thin, meaning that many apps don't display properly, or display smaller than they strictly need to, with empty space above or below their main displays. This means that a lot of screen space ends up wasted even though there isn't much of it. It would be much more convenient to use if it were the same overall size but just a little shorter and wider.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sean Brown', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Small convenient phone,bigger than mid 2000’s but 100 times more useful', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Appearance,feels extremly well put together,I don’t know what you have to do to wear the battery out but I haven’t managed it yet,speed,sound and screen are as good as my up to date pixel.

I know a lot of people have commented on the clicking, sprocket-type rotation of the swivel stand... while the sound is something to adjust to, possibly, this design feature has been a great and unexpected plus for my mom!!Since she does not have great dexterity or control, oftentimes her attempts to manipulate devices can be frustrating for he because they are either too tight for her to move, or too loose to allow for only minor adjustments. The way this product rotates/swivels (clicking/locking in ""per turn"" to the left or right) is wonderful for my mom. She can turn it exactly how she needs it without it overcompensating and spinning further than intended for each click.She does need assistance with raising or lowering the cradle, and sometimes with the tilt, but this would be the case with any device for her. Often, once the height and tilt are set, swivel is all that she needs to adjust anyhow. She mostly uses this for her iPad, but sometimes for her phone as well. This just provides such great balance and sturdiness, that it never tips on her. Also, the foam padding on the bottom prevents it from slipping away from her or scratching the table.Super quality, assembly, and finish; very smooth finish and function!

After a month or two of using it however, I have concluded that it's awful, with few redeeming features. What I wanted was a nice tough small phone that could be taken anywhere and that just worked; an otherwise normal Android phone, but for hiking or trips or travel, since most smartphones will break just by looking at a travel plan.This is still quite a brick of a phone that barely fits in most pockets or containers, and I can tolerate that design in that it is pretty bombproof, but it could be two-thirds the size and work effectively, and that's only the beginning of its problems.The OS software is just plain absymal.None of the functionality is normal for stock Android, and the custom UX is totally counter-intuitive. If you go looking for a setting to modify how Android behaves, like a normal user, this phone won't even have the setting. Not even in developer options. It is riddled with stupid sounds that can't be turned off.Nothing really explains why AGM felt the need to Fisher Price dumb down the user interface. There's no money to be saved in a budget phone by reducing the settings available. I'm not sure what target market this is aimed at, that will benefit from an OS that is made harder to navigate and harder to customise.The camera is pretty terrible as reviews did indicate (nearly all shots are grainy or blurry), but I didn't get it for taking pictures, and the overall responsiveness of the phone is slow, but it's a budget phone, this at least I can expect.Not really a travel phone, in my opinion.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'A H', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Basic phone but has all the necessary smartphone features', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2024', 'Review Body': 'It does everythign you need it to, the operting system feel and works pretty well too and the device is exptremly durable which coems with som eextra bulk as you would expect.

And my old 2G PAYG phone was getting very slow even though I didn't use it for the internet.For a long time I was confounded by the choice of smartphones available - every time I found one that looked about right there was some issue with it. I found the Nokia CO2 though the Moneysavingexpert website which is very easy to use. The reviews were decent and the phone remarkably cheap for a new model. Amazon has an excellent returns policy so I took the leap into smartphonedom.As others have said it's tricky to get the back off, but you only have to do it once so it's not important. Of course it's not a phone it's a computer, so like a new PC it takes an hour to get its brains together, install updates and a plethora of apps, mostly unwanted, that you can amuse yourself trying to delete afterwards. You can swipe up and down and various things come and go but rarely what you want. On the odd occasion when I get a screenful of various detailed options I don't know what to choose. I'll spend some more time time trying to understand it tomorrow. I guess all smartphones are like this - and apparently this is a simple one. I might use the camera very occasionally but somehow I've disabled it and can't find my way back to the stage I did it.Day two - I've managed to delete or disable the apps I don't want, and generally configure the phone more as I want it. I got the camera going by choosing 'Use camera as a phone' - to which the obvious answer was 'no' because I want to use the phone as a camera not the other way round... I even found a torch function! As a newbie it's far from intuitive, but that's down probably down to Android not the phone itself. One deficiency with the CO2 is that you can't divide contacts into groups - everyone is in one big long list. Even my 2014 2G LG phone had groups, so this seems a strange omission. And one minor detail is that whilst the photo in the advert shows the Nokia logo in white, in reality they didn't bother with the white so it's just pressed in, which looks cheap.Useability aside, the phone is a good size (big enough but not too big) and the build quality seems good for the price.

I didn\'t particularly want a new 7"" tablet. I was attracted to this for 4 reasons:1 - it\'s inexpensive,2 - it\'s NOT a Samsung and therefore doesn\'t have the clunky and infuriating Bixby installed3 - it\'s got a USB B socket the same as the other devices I use for the exercise classes4 - it\'s small but quite big enough for my purposesIt connects to my speaker through Bluetooth and works perfectly as an mp3 player.I have all my Google apps on the device and full access to everything I need to run my business; i\'e Gmail, Google Keep, Drive, address book, Google calendar etc. The brilliant thing about using Google is that all devices synchronise with each other. I can enter a new contact on this device and it will automatically synch with my Chromebook and any other devices on the same Google account.The Go edition of Android is fine for my specific purposes running this business ... but I wouldn\'t have it on a phone; it\'s too under-powered.I don\'t have a SIM card in it. It automatically connects to the wifi of all the halls that I work in so I have Internet access should I need it. I leave it in my exercise business-bag so there\'s no chance of confusing it with my phone!I\'m very happy to have this as a micro-tablet and it leaves my phone free to be used for everything else in life.************************************************I\'m a great fan of Nokia stuff. I used to be a Samsung fan, but this Bixby stuff drives me nuts! My current phone is a Nokia G11 which I am delighted with. I thought at first that I would miss the Samsung customisations, but I really don\'t. Quite the opposite; it\'s a breath of fresh air not having to stress about Samsung installing apps that I don\'t want, but they think I should have.All smart Nokia devices run either a full basic or Go edition version of Android free of bloatware and without customisations. That suits me absolutely fine. When the time comes to replace my ageing Samsung 10"" tablet, I\'ll go for a Nokia and make the transition complete. Yay!

Le foto scattate risultano nitide a distanze medio-corte, anche in condizioni di scarsa illuminazione.Dopo numerose cadute, inclusa una da circa 8 metri, il dispositivo non ha riportato danni. I tasti, sebbene leggermente rigidi, rispondono coerentemente con la robustezza tipica dei dispositivi rugged. La qualità delle chiamate è eccellente; nessuno ha mai riportato problemi di audio in oltre un mese di utilizzo.

I spoke to the excellent telephone support team who recommended to turn off the phone, remove the battery for 30 seconds then retry. This fixed the issue and the battery now charges to 100%.The rear camera is not great, but the front camera is fine for Skype and Whats app calls. I have downloaded a few extra apps which are good enough for my purpose. I don’t use this phone as a music repository or to take photos and store pictures, but that said, you can increase storage capacity with an SD card if you want to do this.I have found the phone great for calls, texting and video calls plus it syncs to my car with Android Car Play and Bluetooth giving me full access to voice commands for making and receiving calls and SMS messages. It also runs the Kia UVO app so i can send navigation info and monitor the car remotely.The screen is perfectly acceptable. I use the Android “invert colour” function and the contrast is very good. For viewing pictures the screen is a bit washed out and the viewing angle isn’t great.Battery life is around 2 days if I make about 6 calls a day and send some texts and the odd short skype video call, perfectly acceptable for my needs.This is not really a phone for people that “live on their phones” but for simple calling, texting, video calls and running the odd app I think it represents fantastic value for money.

I am a very experienced smartphone user (just adding that as a lot of reviews for phones on Amazon are often by very clueless people) and have had numerous Android phones, and I upgraded from a Samsung S7 Edge.It has a nice 6"" screen, but because of the small bezels it doesn\'t feel large in the hands or pocket at all. The cameras (colour and B&W) are really good, I am an experienced photographer with good cameras and lenses, and normally hate phone cameras, but this is the first phone I have owned where I will use it when out and about and not have to carry a camera with me all the time. The low light pictures are frankly amazing for a phone.Battery life is excellent, I can easily go a day on a charge, and it recharges to full in less than an hour using the supplied USB-C charger.It comes with minimal extra apps installed over standard Android. I can\'t speak much about the UI for the homescreen as I always use Nova Launcher, but the settings menus are well laid out and have a lot of useful features. Performance of the phone is very good, and the 6GB of RAM helps a lot.Phone comes with screen protector applied in the box, and also a transparent protection case.Downsides:This is the first USB-C device I have owned, and it has no headphone jack. It does have a USB-C to headphone jack dongle which does the job. It has a pair of earphones bundles in, but while the sound quality was pretty decent, they don\'t stay in my ears at all, they are very poorly shaped with no rubber cover to help them stay in. It has no MicroSD slot, but with 128GB of internal storage that isn\'t an issue for me.Overall it is a fantastic phone that performs like a flagship model but costs less than half the price. Is a real bargain IMO.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'S.

Decided on the Mate 10 Pro coz it had no notch and a 96hr battery rating on GSM Arena.What can I say? Awesome. Very good looks, solid build and it does have that great battery.The Emui skin is not too intrusive but I always put Nova Launcher on for my own customisation.It comes with a clear case, screen protector applied, fast charge brick and some USB-C earphones (and a 3.5mm to USB-C  for normal earphones you may want to use).The screen is great. The new 18:9 ratio that most phones seem to have means it's taller but narrower, easier on the pocket.It does have some strong power saving modes as default but you can soon sort out which ones to turn off. The battery life is really good. After a full, first charge, it took me 8hrs setting it up, with screen full brightness to run it down. Very impressive. After a few days with it being used normally, it easily gets through a day. Sometimes with 60% still left!The audio is another strong point. Using some hi res earphones I get some good, clear audio. I mostly use Spotify at very high quality. I did notice it doesn't like third party equalisers, preferring it's own, very customisable app. Using its own external speakers the phone uses a downward firing port for the lows while the earpiece handles the treble. However, switch to landscape mode, for video viewing and the two speakers then also split the audio to stereo too. Very good idea.The camera is very good, plenty of modes, though to be honest, I don't use it that often. A few stills, when out with friends etc but they look crystal clear.6gb of ram is more than enough to handle the four constant widgets I have on my home screen and still show no signs of lag.As this model has been superceded by the Mate 20 and P20 models, it's now over half the price it was a year ago. Also, although it's a year old, it still has Android 8 so still pretty much up to date, software wise.It's a great phone, that battery is phenomenal.

Result!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2018', 'Review Body': 'Okay my LG G4 finally went bootloop after just over 3 years. So I needed a new phone. I\'m never that much of a mug to pay more than £400 for a phone if I have to so took a look at what was going on Amazon for £250 to £400. So we had the Nokia 8 which looked great and super cheap but no notification light. Google Pixel XL MK1...great again but comes out of update support right now so no point. The LG G6 was looking solid if a little dull but I fancied a change maybe. Then the Mate 10 Pro was up. Great looking camera, half the launch price and plenty of storage. The other thing was the 4000mAh battery. If I can\'t change them at least I\'ll get a phone with a bigger battery. Oh and it has a notification light.Sold!Okay the phone took nearly a week to arrive but hey. First niggle is the charging cable is 18"" too short. The phone itself is great. I made sure I left the screen protector on by peeling the removal tab off instead. Into the case it went. Power on and two updates went straight on which was a good start. I then put back my apps and installed MS Launcher as I didn\'t want to get involved with EMUI. MS Launcher gives me the most barebones launcher once its tweaked as I want it.I was able to remove/disable 80% of the pre-installed stuff. The only stuff I couldn\'t was the usual own brand contacts/mail/messaging type stuff. Not terrible I suppose.So speed it great, as is the screen. You can change the screen colour but it comes pretty settled out of the box. The camera seems great though I haven\'t done much yet. B&W photography does look gorgeous I have to say. I don\'t take selfies being a 47 year old bloke.I don\'t listen to music on my phone so the loss of headphone jack is not an issue nor is wireless charging.One feature I miss from the G4 is the split audio levels for ringtone and notifications. Also I have to say the notification light on the 10 pro is a bit pathetic. It\'s the tiniest LED. Womp Womp!Battery life is tough to call as I\'m still in the honeymoon period but it will do me fine I think.It\'s since dropped another £15 since I ordered it so even more or a bargain!Here\'s hoping it lasts me three years!Edit - As of Jan 8th, all going well, super well in fact. I got the Android Pie upgrade pushed to my phone about three days ago (about the 5th update I\'ve had since October so not bad). Very nice indeed.

The only reason it doesn't get the extra star, is it does not seem to have NFC technology to make contactless payments with relevant Apps. In fairness, I did not buy it with this need in mind, as it's really just my back-up phone. So far, the battery is lasting for ages between charges (around 4 days of normal use) and the speed of running Apps (albeit I am not using it for gaming or regular streaming) is reasonably fast. Use of the speaker phone volume seems a little lower than I would have liked, despite checking all settings. The phone is slim, but it is quite big compared to other phones I have used - a format that seems more popular these days: approx. 8cm x 17cm x 9cm (when including the additionally supplied clear, gel feel, protective body case).One thing I am getting used to, is the physical buttons for volume and power, are on the right hand side of the phone as you look at it. Although I am right-handed, I always hold my phone in my left hand and usually use my left thumb to work those controls - perhaps something that shows my age, that in the old days, you would leave your right hand free to write notes. So in an odd way, it feels to me like a left-handed phone.\nRead more""}]",,B0CYSYTJTZ,https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0CYSYTJTZ,4g

I just wanted something cheap and robust to keep in touch with him when he's out with friends. When I started to set it up the night before, it popped up something about restoring it...I thought it's supposed to be a new phone, why would it ask to restore...it was a quick message that disappeared as quickly as it popped up ...so I carried on setting it up. What I noticed was the battery was draining by the minute (from a full charge) I thought maybe it's just because it's going through the set up process it's using more power...anyway set up was simple, it felt very light and came with a clear case so thought it would be ok for him....he was absolutely delighted on his birthday opening it, almost in tears!As the days went on the one thing we both noticed was the battery, it could reach full charge in about 20mins! But it would run out in less than an hour. That's with no games etc, literally just whatsapp and texting. It could be sat on the sofa and you'd see the battery % tick down. Then WhatsApp started playing up, kicked him out saying it was an illegal version of the app we had...we downloaded it from the play store.. I thought it was maybe the sim card, which was also brand new and part of my own contract, so I contacted EE, they said it's not the number, it's the phone. The main reason I bought it was to keep in touch over WhatsApp, now he was blocked from that and after googling for days found there was no way to sort that. From day 1 he was also getting constant spam calls and texts, again I thought this was to do with the number (brand new SIM) literally as I was setting the phone up he got a call from California! But EE said with everything else it sounds like the phone is just dodgy because he shouldn't get spam as soon as the SIM was activated. So in the end we returned this phone for a full refund, hassle free to be fair and I bought him a Samsung! I wasn't expecting anything flashy for the price and the fact it says 'cheap' in the title enforced that... however it wasn't fit for purpose to us\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'EJR', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Cheap phone for the oldies', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2024', 'Review Body': ""Does the trick.

I checked that all apps used on my IPhone 6S were available first. I received the phone the day after ordering. I had it fully set up and did a full contact bluetooth transfer between the phones within an hour. Almost a week in now and i'm over the moon with the phone. Lighter and slimmer than the apple with a bigger screen. Great definition. The camera is also fantastic. The images produced are more vivid and sharper than i thought they would be. Sometimes the autofocus needs a little longer with cross lighting but generally very good. It was definately a learning curve switching from ios to Android but i'm already settled in. I'm still on contract hence the Sim Free option with this phone. I won't be looking back again. I really am delighted with this phone. Battery life comparison is fab also. Leaving for work at 6 in the week and getting home about 6 the apple would have about 40% charge left with moderate use throughout the day.

Handles multiple apps easily too. The screen is great, beautiful colours and offers a really good view angle. It's an android so it will only have a few different options in the menu compared to other brands running on android. It was a quick and easy job to find these differences and setup the phone to my liking.On the design side all I can say is that the phone looks really good, a really elegant, classic design.

Even after uninstalling most of the apps, the phone still takes a long time to load and freezes up frequently.Overall, I would not recommend this phone to anyone looking for a reliable device.

The build quality is excellent with a pleasant weight in the hand, and despite the back being made of plastic it has a premium feel.The UI leaves something to be desired, but after installing a custom launcher (Nova launcher is a must for those who appreciate the feel of stock Android) I was pleased with the little quirks and niceties that MIUI has to offer. While not as feature heavy as the flagship Galaxy S7, you do get a lot for your money here.The camera is serviceable, and can produce very attractive shots for those who know how to navigate the innards of a phone camera. Low-light seems to be a bit of an issue, producing grainy images, but when the lighting is good this camera can hold up as above average. The front camera is fine, but I'm not one for selfies.On the bottom we have the speakers which I'd personally prefer to be front facing, but they are loud enough. And I use headphones more often than not, so it is not a huge issue.3GB of RAM is plenty, and never experienced slowdown on my time with it, but time will tell how this holds up. The Kirin 650 processor, whilst mid-range, is competent enough to allow me to do all the things I need without issue.The display, whilst not amazing, is good. It's a 1080p IPS display - while most flagships are 1440p at this stage, the reduced resolution helps with battery life and cost - the colours are accurate and images are sharp, so it is good enough. Obviously AMOLED is superior, but when balancing cost/benefit, Id say this is the right choice.With the mid-range processor, and large battery, you can expect about a day and a half or moderate to heavy usage with no problems - great for people who use their phone almost constantly.It operates on Android Marshmallow out of the box, but Android 7.0 Nougat is available to download right now. Hopefully we will receive the update to 7.1 and get all the nice battery optimisations that come with that.If you're in the market for a mid-range phone, and don't want to shell out for the more up to date models (such as the P10 lite, or the Honor 9) then you can't go wrong with the P9 lite.Build: 5/5 (Though I would have preferred USB-)Sound: 4/5Camera: 4/5Performance: 4/5Display: 4/5Software: 3/5 (without a custom launcher) or 4/5 (with a custom launcher)\nRead more""}]",,B01HTKAPUI,https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B01HTKAPUI,

The storage capacity is beyond what I need, so I devoted an extra 6GB of ROM to RAM. I'm not sure if that's a Umidigi specific feature or not, but it's very handy. The camera is not quite as spectacular as an iPhone, but for about an eighth of the price I'm not going to complain, and it's still better than any other phone camera I've had. The battery usually lasts me two days with normal use, and under heavy use (studying, gaming, and playing music for multiple hours) it's usually around 25% by nighttime. The processor has handled every game I've put up to it and it's never lagged or had any delay, no matter how many apps I have up.It can utilize VoLTE, NRLTE, and work as a hotspot if your mobile plan allows these. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a high quality phone for a fraction of the price of a comparable device. $200 isn't exactly pocket change or the cheapest phone available, but I think probably the best buy available dollar for dollar.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Shopper', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on 29 December 2023', 'Review Body': 'Got a boxing day deal.

It does not work like one and if you are expecting a feeling of ""Oh it\'s just like the old one!"" you will be disappointed. What you are getting though is a fresh and lite take on an old classic! If you are old enough to remember small mobile phones or you never had a smaller phone than 5inch, you will feel refreshed! It\'s small, slim, comfortable to hold and feels like something that belongs in your hand. I heard people say: looks like a you! Well... and? It\'s completely a class of its own. It\'s a good looking phone. The color is more orange than red, didn\'t see the others live so won\'t be able to say if blue is blue or yellow is yellow. I like the color - looks fresh and has this ""zing"" to it. Built quality is satisfying, let\'s not cheat ourselves - it\'s plastic:) but good plastic. Seems durable. Screen quality is acceptable, you will see things you need to see. It has a camera... and yeah, that\'s it about the camera^^ If you have large hands, the phone will get lost in them and you will have difficulties using the t9 style keyboard then again, if you buy it to answer phone calls or you have ""artist hands"" this will not be an issue. It is loud but do not expect crisp sound quality when listening to music with the speaker that is built in. That is it... It is a phone. A good quality device from Nokia. Want to give it to you kid? Perfect. Want to give it to an older person? Go for it. Want to disconnect yourself from the basics of having a battery draining, time eating YouTube and Social Media machines that try to take over the world? Hell Yes! It is a good, basic feature phone that will make you stand out. I bought it because I have a soft spot for those quirky things and I was positively surprised. What\'s in the box? Phone, battery, headphones and a charger. See? Basics. Oh... I do not know yet how long the battery holds because it did not die yet. Anyway - recommended for people that want something different, a different experience, or for people that want to stand out with a simple thing. Remember - buy from Amazon, not to get a fake device:)\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stupot', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A Decent Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2017', 'Review Body': ""This phone is pretty good although it is quite basic and different from the original 3310. It is sim free but it will not work on 3 as that is a 3g network and this phone is 2g only. It is ideal if you just want a basic phone to make calls or send text messages and is ideal to use in the workplace rather than use your decent smartphone. The price I paid was the retail price but some of these are being sold at ridiculous prices and I personally would not pay it. I keep mine in the car as I don't always take my phone out with me. It does have an mp3 player built in which is a bonus. I have also purchased the orange version for my wife which she really likes. The bonus feature on these is they have a 2000 internal memory for the phone book with a call blocker built in for unwanted numbers. This is essential for my wife as she only uses hers for family members. If she does ring out, her number is blocked except for certain numbers in her phone book and she does not text. It is perfect for anybody who wants to keep their privacy. Overall it does what it is designed for and although it is a bit pricey, it is a lot cheaper than a decent smartphone and ideal in certain circumstances or as a main phone if you are not bothered about smartphones. There does appear to be a lot of fakes on here and even though I bought mine from Amazon direct, my wife's came from the Carphone Warehouse because I couldn't get the colour she wanted from Amazon itself, but Amazon was the cheapest and they are both genuine Nokia 3310 handsets. You simply have to trust the seller you buy from and not take any unnecessary risks which unfortunately is not good for the genuine sellers because unless you know them, you are buying blind at the end of the day.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Khaling-Solti', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Classic Design with Basic Features', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2017', 'Review Body': ""This is a basic classic mobile phone so don't expect more features however with the price tag £50 it should have more memory space ie 2 GB at least so that we can store more ringtones and few photos.

It's a great phone that I used to get 2days out of the battery. Sadly it struggles to get a day now. But considering how long I have had it and used it on a daily basis, I'm very happy with that. Which is why I purchased another one. However, the advertisement says single sim uk version (model number CLT L09), which is not what I received. I received a dual sim International version (model number CLT L29). There are slight nuances between the 2, the screen at the bottom curves in the corners on the international which it does not on the UK version. The OS is slightly different and it will only upgrade to Emui 10, rather than the Emui 12 I currently use. This may not bother others, but it did me.  The phone did come new in box and sealed. However, the charger plug did have tiny dents in it around the top and the top plug insert was very wobbly. I wouldn't expect this for a brand new sealed phone.

First the good.Great hardware. Exceptional camera as you've probably seen in the reviews and the UI is easy to use. The screen itself is crisp and sharp - and at a nice high resolution. Phone is very responsive, and I find the memory capacity more than enough for my app needs. Battery often lasts a couple of days, and a supercharge can be done from near empty in under an hour. I like also how easy it is to link your phone to a screen, either via USB C at work or say a FireStick at home. The phone compass is a bit iffy, but generally good enough for navigation and bearings. The finger sensor is slightly fussy I've found in terms of matching the angle you registered a fingerprint at. Facial recognition works well, but as a security feature I would turn it off - it doesn't have the depth perception capability of the Apple phones.Now the downside. And it's a big one for me personally. Huawei's EMUI operating system is set to aggressively preserve battery life. This means that any non-core app gets put in to sleep mode after about 30 minutes of inactivity, and this includes WhatsApp. For me, and many others I bet, WhatsApp is their principal comms platform. If you don't log in to WA for about 30 minutes it stops polling for messages. Many a time I've checked in after a few hours and received a ton of messages in one go. I've changed all the possible settings (and there are a LOT that are hidden away) but none of these fix it. I've spoken to Huawei support and they advised wiping my phone, then suggested I contact WhatsApp for a fix!!  Look around, there are many other posts on this subject. If WA messenger is important to you, then I would not recommend this phone with EMUI 9, at least until they fix this key issue.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Allan W.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Awesome Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2019', 'Review Body': 'I love everything about this phone!Screen is so clear and sharp and unlike my old HTC phone I can see it outdoors in bright sunlight.

No phone issues or problems. Nokia X10, 6.67"" & 5G Model. White rear cover & factory fitted Screen Protector(100% Compostible.) Sold and delivered by Amazon, undamaged, new, with box sealed, and 11 days early! *UPDATE: April2024. February & March security updates installed.  No quality, or performance issues. * March 2023: Latest OS(operating system) update, Android 13, included the addition of a ""Personal Safety"" app, which provides a short cut to contact Emergency Services, and a ""Car Crash Detector"" which will contact them for you. So it is no longer just iPhone devices that have this facility. Latest Security Patch installed, too. *Also, for those that criticise Nokia, I recently read on Reuters news that Huawei have announced that they will continue to licence technology from Nokia; an agreement which started in 2017. Nokia confirmed the arrangement. *I was also permitted to uninstall Google 1, which I have never used; the only Google apps I actively use are Gmail, and occasionally Chrome - which I regularly clean the cache & data usage from. *UPDATE: DECEMBER 2022. I recently UPDATED to ANDROID 13, using some of my SIM/monthly pre-payment GB quota; wi-fi was not necessary, and worked fast enough for me. Phone works well, with no issues or disappointments; also pleasing that very little amount of Cache to clean. *A replacement for my Android 11 updated Xiaomi Redmi 9 3/32GB(see my review.) My Xiaomi Note 9T(see my review) has stopped duplicate notifications, and has accepted I am not updating to Android 11. Having decided never to buy a 100% Chinese  smartphone again, due to privacy, and increasing permissions issues, and loss of functions; as well as owner and press reviews. This narrowed the choices considerably, but resistance was not futile! I wanted 5G back-up, again, due to my reading that 6G is well along in phone research and development, and planning. Also, Research found upper entry level 5G phones have a lower spec, in order to offer 5G, with the accusation that some are only 5G to boost sales, due to the huge investment in 5G networks. I came so close to buying Motorola, as, though owned by Lenovo, the brand reputation has not really suffered. Indeed, they have many happy owners, some on their third or fourth handset. But concerns over receiving even one update, ongoing over abundance of models, and the expert opinion that Motorola have never, since, matched the quality of the original 2013 Moto G, made me ""pass them by"". *Next Samsung had to be researched, though I resent paying a premium for the brand. Though soon to be overtaken by the dreaded Xiaomi, for sale of smartphone sets, Samsung had to be considered for upper entry level price, camera, & reviews. Struggling to find a 5G, with a good camera (not a right) and spec, the ""shock horror"" moment came when I stumbled across a former happy owner of one new Samsung model, who, with his first update, discovered his phone performance had been slowed, and camera quality reduced. (Didn\'t iPhone once try a similar strategy, to motivate owners to trade up? Didn\'t it end badly, for them?) Samsung seem to have gotten over their perception that some models were underpriced, and that owners took unfair advantage of them, as, surprisingly, the A53 5G has been professionally reviewed as over priced, and with lesser performance than the earlier A52s, and by design, such as moving from a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset to Samsung\'s own Exynos 1280 chipset = an overall downgrade. I cannot emphasize this enough, check professional technical, and owner, reviews; as well as provider ratings (Amazon UK Logistics were recently rated as number, by Which? magazine, as No 1 for punctuality reliability, and services) before sinking your money into what is an expensive purchase, even at upper entry level. *So my journey carried on, but not for long, when I found the mid-level Nokia X10 5G, at a very competitively Amazon Black Friday discounted price - compared to the release, and then, later, - reduced prices. Our 2016 Microsoft 640 XL still has better telephone call quality than the Xiaomi, ok battery, Zeiss camera, SMS messaging &  navigation working, although the rear speaker is now complaining at high volume, at age 6!. I was pleased to read the X10 specs, including Zeiss optics, and owner reviews for the X10. On top of that, a great price! I do not use Fingerprint, or Face, recognition security, so cannot comment on it, apart from not liking it - maybe because I have got used to not worrying about my 4 fingers and a thumb remaining on each hand!  X10 came with seemingly better quality factory fitted screen protector a soft 100% compostible separate ""oat meal effect"" surface eco rear protector; with black USB C cable. I think the build quality is solid, and it looks stylish.  TDM confirmed it accepts 18 watts fast charge, which is fine for me, as I a have an Amazon supplied MAGI-X-Charger, which has good owner reviews. Having recently read that smartphone batteries last longer if they are charged from 40% up to 80%, as required - avoiding going under 20%, and up to100% charge, I have adopted this method. Fully charging a battery takes longer, and did not lengthen the performance, or life, of 2 previous dead non-supplied by Amazon smartphones (including a 2018 ASUS ZENFONE 4 520 - died 3 months before end of warranty; supposedly new battery and OS didn\'t stop it dying a second time, 3 months after warranty expired.) So 40%-80% takes around 40 minutes with my 18watts charger, which is not inconvenient for me. As expected, for we are still using the Microsoft 640XL for national & international calls, the Telephone call quality of the X10, and Zeiss camera, is superior to the Android 10 only Redmi9T (will not update to Android 11; I am still refusing permissions to access all data, tracking, & monitoring, and, keeping the front camera covered with a cut to size sticker); and previous Redmi9 - both infuriating the Mrs, and her having to use mobile earbuds. The apps tray is accessible from sliding the screen upwards (not having to go to ""Settings"",  ""Apps"", then ""Manage Apps"") and has no Apps Bloating, so no need for me to delete 25+ pre-installed apps I deleted to free up more RAM on the Xiaomis! Easy to set up, by touching the ""Configuration"" message, then ""Install""!  Commence slide just above the bottom black bar, where you see ""Nokia"", to return to front screen. A Black Friday genuine Amazon bargain! Conclusion: a welcome return to Nokia for quality and specs; lack of ""Bloatware"", tracking, monitoring, data demanding permissions; or mischievous system updates, such as Location having to be switched on to use the camera (our Xiaomi Redmi 10 PRO, which lasted 10 months as a home based backup. - See my Review).

Much better now. - No charger in box - you get a ""half case"" made of some white rubbery stuff with what looks like wood chips in it. - Comes with a screen protector pre-installed. - Camera is all right for wideview shots, but rather limited past about 4x zoom. Either stand closer to the subject, or buy a proper small camera (we have a Panasonic pocket camera with a 20x optical zoom which will beat ANY smartphone hands down on stuff like moon photos and pictures of birds and aeroplanes in flight - BUT it is fatter and heavier than a smartphone, and you cannot talk to people with it!) - Battery life is modest if one leaves all the ""connections"" on (Location, wifi, phone signal, bluetooth, NFC) - but a LOT of modern phones are like that. In bright light, one needs to whack up the screen brightness, too ... which uses even more battery. It is just a trade off - power/features vs battery life vs size/thickness. My late 1990\'s Nokia would do about 1 day when new, and I bought a ""fat"" battery (that stuck out the back) to get 1 1/2 days. How times have changed! My Nokia X10 lasts longer than that. (Of course, if one is actively using it all day, battery life is a LOT shorter - that was true 25 years ago, and it is true now!)- Summary - nowhere near as good as the ""flagship"" models from Apple, Samsung, etc., BUT it costs a LOT less. A LOT less. You pays your money and takes your choice. The Nokia X10 6GB/64GB model suits me just fine (especially after I cut a small hole in the ""half-case"" to stop the ""Assistant"" activating so much!)Update: Now mid-September 2023.Yeah, it is generally very good.In the hot weather, it seemed to have problems with my sweaty fingers on the fingerprint reader.In the time I have had it, there were a couple of OS updates - I am now on Android 13.I cannot comment on the ""dual sim"" feature, because I have never tried to use it.The phone does come ""unlocked"", though, so the SIM from my previous phone went straight in and worked with no problems at all.I was torn between buying a ""mini-phone"" (phones with 4 inch screens fit in the pocket better!), and a ""full-size phone"" (which this NOKIA X10 certainly is).Hmm. I have quite big hands, and the screen on the Nokia X10 makes watching YouTube etc on it MUCH better than a ""mini-phone"". [I also have a sports watch, so I do not try to run with a huge phone strapped to my arm!]So all in all, I am very pleased with my Nokia X10 = it does the stuff I want it to.Paying in the supermarket, basic photos even in poor light, WhatsApp messages, actual phone calls, etc etc. And with plenty of RAM and plenty of storage space it should last me for a while.I am hoping for 5 years from the phone - less than 3 and I will be disappointed, more than 5 and I will e even more delighted.[A previous Sony Ericsson, an X8 from 2011 worked for about 11 years, although at the end the battery life was very short and current apps no longer worked - it had Android 2.1! But it still made calls and texts, and took basic photos - I used one for a car insurance claim, where ANY camera is better than no camera!The Nokia I bought in the 1990s lasted me 8 years, a 2110 I think, and I changed that for a cheaper contract rather than there being anything wrong with the phone!So this is my second Nokia: 8 years for the first.Yeah, I have high hopes for this NOKIA, too, even though it is unlikely it will match that Sony Ericsson!]\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Karolina D Wakulinska', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Nokia X10 is a cool phone!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2024', 'Review Body': ""I needed a phone and even though I'm not a fan of buying new ones, I thought I will treat myself with this Nokia. I have a soft spot for this brand being an 80ties kid, and using various models before smartphones became the thing.Firstly- I fell for a colour (I know, that's silly) but I just love it. Phone itself if functional, easy to set up and navigate, it has decent camera. Comes with many pre downloaded aps, most of them quite useful. It does not lag, so far no issues at all. It comes with quite sturdy, compostable case and necessary usb cables. However, it does not have interchangeable battery ( which I didn't realize! )- so I do hope this will not become an issue too soon ( in my opinion, this is rather bad practice that renders phone useless once battery is spent, but as far as I know- this will be soon banned ).

I part set it up and he completed it and added his apps.  He loves taking photos and the photos are really good. See examples.I understand it has face recognition but chose not to use that (or any form of security) as my son hasn\'t quite grasped that bit yet and I was afraid he\'d lock himself out trying to alter settings.

Compared to my phones I love this Nokia. There\'s no bloatware. There\'s nothing that\'s clogging up the speed or the use of the device. It\'s an absolute dream. The camera is TRUE to what it says 13MP all day long (unlike on my newest ""flagship"" phone - 48MP sounded good but only on one mode that isn\'t worth using). The video on the Nokia is good too. All easy to use.Battery life is great. I\'m impressed. USB-C connection too.The good thing too is my son added an app which means we can face chat when he\'s out and about - much better than carer\'s relaying through the dimphone. Adding and using apps is easy. There\'s provision to add extra SD storage.And now knowing what other android phone providers offer I personally will not bother with the the flagship brand next time.If you\'re tech savvy or out for the latest technology this probably won\'t be the phone for you.

I have to say that I wasn't expecting very much, after all how good could a phone that was a tenth the cost of an iPhone be?First impressions are important and with a phone the first impression is the packaging. The Nokia packaging was very like Apple's, reassuringly sturdy and glossy. The overall impression was that this was a luxury product at a budget price. Then there was the phone. I was expecting it to feel plasticy and cheap. What I found was a phone that was nicely weighty and felt extremely well built. The initial set up was easy but it did take a little time as it had to download two updates, each of over a gigabyte in size but once that was done everything was set up in a couple of minutes. The interface, which, again, I thought was going to be slow and sluggish, was smooth and responsive. The only negative is the resolution of the cameras and it could have more built-in memory (although you can use an SD card to expand the memory), apart from that this is a fantastic phone.

On the other hand, the S24, with its flagship processor, is ideal for power users and gamers. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14, though fast and optimized for iOS, tends to be pricier for delivering similar performance.In terms of display, the A55 likely features a vibrant Super AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it excellent for everyday viewing. The S24 steps up with a superior QHD+ AMOLED display, perfect for high-end content consumption. The iPhone 14 has a high-quality display but falls short of the smoother 120Hz refresh rate found in the other models.When it comes to the camera, the A55 likely boasts a 50 MP setup, offering great photos for casual users. The S24, with its advanced flagship-level camera system, delivers top-tier image quality. The iPhone 14 is reliable, though it has a lower megapixel count compared to Samsung's mid-range options.For battery life, the A55 is expected to provide all-day power on a budget, while the S24 offers fast charging and optimization aimed at power users. The iPhone 14 has decent battery life but lacks the faster charging capabilities seen in the S24.In terms of build and design, the A55 features a sleek and value-oriented design, while the S24 shines with premium materials and an IP68 rating for durability. The iPhone 14 maintains Apple's solid build with its classic design aesthetic.Finally, when considering price, the A55 offers excellent value for its performance and features.

The rugged design is ideal for situations where my primary phone might be at risk, and the compact size makes it incredibly easy to carry on the go. Despite its affordable price, the Blade10 holds its own against my flagship device in many areas, which genuinely surprised me.The 6.56’’ HD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate offers vibrant colors and smooth scrolling, making it a pleasure to use. The 16MP rear camera, complemented by the 8MP front camera, captures stunning photos, even in challenging conditions. I was particularly impressed with the intelligent scene recognition, which ensures I never miss an important moment, whether I'm capturing a scenic landscape during a ride or a quick selfie.The performance is more than adequate, with 9GB of RAM and 128GB of ROM, expandable up to a whopping 2TB via a TF card. This allows for seamless multitasking and ample storage space for all my apps, photos, and media. The three card slots are a practical addition, enabling me to manage multiple SIM cards and expand storage effortlessly.One of the standout features is the 5150mAh battery, which provides outstanding battery life. Whether I'm using GPS, streaming music, or making calls, the phone easily lasts throughout the day without needing a charge.Overall, the DOOGEE Blade10 has exceeded my expectations as a rugged, reliable secondary phone.

Its slim design fits easily into my pocket, whether I'm out with the kids, jogging or walking the dogs.The battery life feels like it lasts for days depending on usage, which is ideal for someone like me who spends a lot of time outside and often forgets to charge my phone. It’s a huge plus during hikes or camping trips, and the camera captures everything beautifully, from landscapes to family moments with our pets. I even took it underwater using a waterproof phone case, when I was paddle boarding along the coast recently, and the video quality was sharp.One of my favorite features is the customisable side button, which saves me time by providing quick access to my most-used apps.

The camera is TRUE to what it says 13MP all day long (unlike on my newest ""flagship"" phone - 48MP sounded good but only on one mode that isn\'t worth using). The video on the Nokia is good too. All easy to use.Battery life is great. I\'m impressed.

The Nokia packaging was very like Apple's, reassuringly sturdy and glossy. The overall impression was that this was a luxury product at a budget price. Then there was the phone. I was expecting it to feel plasticy and cheap. What I found was a phone that was nicely weighty and felt extremely well built. The initial set up was easy but it did take a little time as it had to download two updates, each of over a gigabyte in size but once that was done everything was set up in a couple of minutes. The interface, which, again, I thought was going to be slow and sluggish, was smooth and responsive. The only negative is the resolution of the cameras and it could have more built-in memory (although you can use an SD card to expand the memory), apart from that this is a fantastic phone.

On the other hand, the S24, with its flagship processor, is ideal for power users and gamers. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14, though fast and optimized for iOS, tends to be pricier for delivering similar performance.In terms of display, the A55 likely features a vibrant Super AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it excellent for everyday viewing. The S24 steps up with a superior QHD+ AMOLED display, perfect for high-end content consumption. The iPhone 14 has a high-quality display but falls short of the smoother 120Hz refresh rate found in the other models.When it comes to the camera, the A55 likely boasts a 50 MP setup, offering great photos for casual users. The S24, with its advanced flagship-level camera system, delivers top-tier image quality. The iPhone 14 is reliable, though it has a lower megapixel count compared to Samsung's mid-range options.For battery life, the A55 is expected to provide all-day power on a budget, while the S24 offers fast charging and optimization aimed at power users. The iPhone 14 has decent battery life but lacks the faster charging capabilities seen in the S24.In terms of build and design, the A55 features a sleek and value-oriented design, while the S24 shines with premium materials and an IP68 rating for durability. The iPhone 14 maintains Apple's solid build with its classic design aesthetic.Finally, when considering price, the A55 offers excellent value for its performance and features.

It's lightweight yet incredibly sturdy, perfect for handling the bumps and knocks of my outdoor adventures and DIY projects without ever feeling bulky. Its slim design fits easily into my pocket, whether I'm out with the kids, jogging or walking the dogs.The battery life feels like it lasts for days depending on usage, which is ideal for someone like me who spends a lot of time outside and often forgets to charge my phone. It’s a huge plus during hikes or camping trips, and the camera captures everything beautifully, from landscapes to family moments with our pets. I even took it underwater using a waterproof phone case, when I was paddle boarding along the coast recently, and the video quality was sharp.One of my favorite features is the customisable side button, which saves me time by providing quick access to my most-used apps. The phone’s grippy texture makes it feel secure in hand, and even though it’s lightweight, it doesn’t feel fragile at all.The audio could be improved in noisy environments, especially when it’s windy, but it’s clear and loud enough in most situations. The screen brightness is excellent too - easy to read even in Scotland’s unpredictable weather.It runs as smooth as my far more expensive work phone with no lag, and I love the three card slots for managing SIMs and expanding storage. I'd recommend this phone because its durable, reliable with fantastic battery life and a rugged design that blends both style and practicality. It offers excellent value and gives more expensive brands a run for their money.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jerry Pratt', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 3 October 2024', 'Review Body': 'Easy to use very tough and can be used in all environments very good clear screen and android 14 easy to update\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nicolas S.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 26 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""J'aime beaucoup l'aspect du métal peint.Les différentes articulations sont à la fois facile à déplacer mais aussi semblent suffisamment résistante pour rester en place\xa0 Une fois la bonne position trouvée.Le fait que ce soit un métal l'objet a un certain poids.

The 64GB of storage is perfect for my needs, offering plenty of space for apps, photos, and documents, with room to spare.But what really sets this phone apart is its rugged design. It’s clear that a lot of thought went into making this device durable. I’ve subjected it to drops, splashes, and dusty environments, and it’s handled everything like a champ. The screen is incredibly tough, and the body is designed to absorb shocks without any damage. The waterproofing is also excellent – I’ve used it in the rain and accidentally dropped it in water, and it kept working without a hitch.Battery life is another highlight. Even with heavy usage, including GPS tracking and video playback, I can easily get through a full day on a single charge.

The TT750 fits the bill perfectly.  I really needed the larger buttons and clearer display as my close-up eye sight is not what it used to be.  The additional display on the front is useful too when the clamshell is closed and although it's slightly larger and heavier than my old Samsung it is not unduly so and still slips into a shirt pocket easily.The camera is fairly crude providing only a 240 x 320 pixel image with poor contrast and not terribly sharp but then I wasn't expecting much better from a £50 phone.  It will also shoot video of similar quality but for that you need an optional microSD memory card inserted under the battery.  The manual didn't specify memory size limits so I contacted TTphone who said they recommended cards between 8 and 16 GB, so I bought a Sandisk 16 GB card which seems to be working fine.  You can connect the phone to your PC and simply drag and drop photos and videos to your hard drive.  Photos can be used to add wallpaper to the phone's screen.I bought the red colour because it is the same as my Samsung and I think it looks very smart.  The large keys feel very positive but when texting I do wish the software made it easier to select a capital letter in the middle of a sentence ... I still haven't mastered it.  As supplied the keys talk the number pressed but I found that irritating and turned it off in the menus along with the equally irritating music when you switch the phone on and off ... silence is golden.I chose to recycle my O2 sim and the TT seems to pick up a much better signal than my Samsung did indoors so that's another bonus for me.  Audio, both received and transmitted, is very good and the speaker can be set very loud for those who are hard of hearing which is also handy if you are stuck in a noisy environment.  Earphones are supplied but I've not tried them so can't comment on their effectiveness.  It also comes with a small charging cradle or you can simply connect the USB charging lead directly into the phone at the side.  Oh, and if you find yourself in the dark, it has a torch facility activated by a button on the side of the phone.All in all a very neat little package with which I am very pleased indeed.Dave.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fabio', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 28 November 2023', 'Review Body': 'Arrivato nei tempi stabiliti.

Designed with a sturdy base and adjustable components, this stand aims to provide a stable and customizable viewing experience for users.One of the standout features of the Tablet Phone Stand is its adjustability. The stand offers multiple angles, allowing you to position your device at the perfect angle for viewing, typing, or video calls. This flexibility is particularly useful for reducing neck strain during prolonged use and adapting to different work or leisure environments.The build quality of the stand is solid, with a well-constructed frame that supports a range of device sizes and weights. The non-slip pads on the base and support arms help keep the stand securely in place, minimizing the risk of accidental slips or falls. Additionally, the stand's design is compact and lightweight, making it easy to move and store when not in use.However, the stand’s adjustability might be limited compared to more premium models. Some users may find that it doesn’t offer as many adjustment options or as robust support for heavier devices. Additionally, while the design is functional, it may not have the same aesthetic appeal as more stylish or designer stands.Overall, the Tablet Phone Stand is a practical and reliable accessory for holding and viewing devices.

Lors de l\'utilisation de son écran l\'ensemble reste très stable, il est prévu pour supporter un poids jusqu’à 900 g.La partie haute qui support le dos des appareils est bien plus haute et large que celle des supports prévus pour les téléphones avec ses dimensions de 14,8 cm x 8 cm. La base ronde de 12,6 cm de diamètre assure une bonne stabilité de l\'ensemble. En raison de sa taille il prend forcément plus de place sur un bureau mais peut aussi être utilisé pour un téléphone de taille plus classique .La construction est solide tout en aluminium anodisé gris foncé et présente une bonne finition. Les deux charnières offrent une résistance assez forte lors de l\'ajustement des angles du pied qui rassure sur le fait que ça ne bougera pas malgré le poids soutenu.La base comporte 4 grands patins en silicone, il ne glisse pas même sur une surface très lisse. Des protections de la même matière sont présentes sur les crochets de maintien en U et sur la plaque afin de préserver la coque des appareils. Une autre a été collée sur une des charnières afin d\'éviter que le dos du support l\'abîme lorsqu\'il est plié.La rotation se fait à 360° sans aucune butée dans les deux sens. Elle peut être faite cran par cran et un bruit de cliquetis se fait entendre pendant l\'utilisation. Sur l\'exemplaire reçu lors de mes 1ères utilisations je devais maintenir la base pour faire tourner le pied. Je l\'ai démonté grâce aux deux vis sous la basse. Après avoir à peine un peu desserré les 4 vis internes et un peu de dégrippant la rotation est devenue plus facile. Le mécanisme est en plastique dur (voir photo)Sa construction et sa taille le rendent assez lourd avec un poids de 277 gr, une fois plié il reste transportable avec des dimensions de 14,8 cm x 12,6 cm par 3,6 cm d\'épaisseur.Très bien adapté aux tablettes, liseuses et téléphones de grands formats.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Philippe', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 7 January 2024', 'Review Body': 'La page du produit ne livrant aucune information, voici celles que fournit le carton d\'emballage, ce stand est libellé ""pour iPad"", mais il convient évidemment aux autres tablettes et téléphones à conditions qu\'ils pèsent moins de 900 grammes ± 50 g.

Default text size is fairly large so the slightly visually impaired may like this. - Battery: lasts a long while! - Face Recognition: It works; not always, but neither did my previous phone.  Choose the angle properly and it\'s fine. - Cost: at £60 it\'s really hard to falter, except for the below.THE BAD: - Storage!  You may, like I did, believe 16GB be sufficient for a few apps.  Once you get the phone and update it, you have a grand total of 3 to 4GB left.You may also like I did, believe you can simply plop in a Micro SD card and format it for internal storage to alleviate this concern: however, app developers can specify in the manifest where their app gets stored- almost all of them have INTERNAL specified and will not be installed on the SD card.-- It\'s a late 2022 model iirc; a 32GB chip wouldn\'t have affected the cost and should\'ve been used instead!-- Most default apps like Shitgle\'s camera default to storing internally and don\'t let you choose somewhere else; so frequent file moving is required (or if you have enough space, install Open Camera instead).-- You\'ll get a notification for ""Your storage is nearly full! Device functionality may not work as intended"" a LOT.- USB connectivity: just does not work.  Developer mode enabled and proper settings configured this phone simply refuses to allow a USB connection.SUMMARY:If you don\'t install a lot of programs, and need a relatively big screen on a device with a decent battery, this is for you!Otherwise, carefully consider if you can put up with the restraints of extremely limited storage because you CANNOT fully extend it with a micro SD (unless you root the device)Apps installed: Uber Driver, Discord, TelegramX, Nationwide, Lidl Plus, Nova Launcher, Muzio Player, Polar FlowSpace left: under 1GB.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ray', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Easy and handy to use', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2023', 'Review Body': 'Good value for money.

However the downsides are it's much slower than most modern phones, doesn't allow wireless charging or contactless payments. Over all it does what it says it will it gives you a useable smartphone in a in a sizeable solid build with a great speaker.

Pugh', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone, highly recommended - pity about the fingerprint scanner', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2020', 'Review Body': ""Bought two Samsung A50's (one for me, one for my wife) to replace our aging Moto G5's which had served us well. My main irritation with the G5 was the lack of a magnetometer sensor (which is vital when using Google maps when walking). Also, the camera was slow and rather average. I had seriously thought about buying the new Moto G7 but opted for the Samsung A50 after reading reviews. The A50 is an excellent phone. The screen is genuinely superb for the price; it’s crystal clear and vibrant. Being AMOLED, it has an “always on” mode which I love. It shows any notifications or missed calls/messages at a glance. The “always on” mode obviously uses a little more power but it is negligible. I charge my phone for around 45 minutes each day when I get up (while showering and having breakfast). This is sufficient to top it back up to 100% which easily sees me through to the following morning. So far, a full days use has not dropped me below 30% battery. The camera is a massive improvement over my old G5, it’s responsive and takes excellent pictures even in relatively low light. I don’t play games much so the performance of the A50 far exceeds my requirements. Browsing the Internet, Google maps, emailing etc. all perform seamlessly. There is however one big negative, the in-screen fingerprint reader is hopeless. It’s very slow and “hitty-missy”, often taking several attempts to unlock your phone. It’s nowhere near as good as the dedicated scanner on my old Moto G5, big mistake for Samsung to try and incorporate a scanner into the screen on a relatively budget phone. Luckily, the face recognition unlocking on the phone works really well so I use this instead – obviously this doesn’t work quite so well in poor light.All in all, I am delighted with the phone and would certainly buy again. The AMOLED screen alone (unusual in this price bracket) wins it over for me. Loses one star for the fingerprint scanner.18th Jan 2020 - Latest updates from Samsung have significantly improved the accuracy of the fingerprint scanning. Still a little slow but a lot more accurate unlocking 99% of the time within one second. Perhaps not as good as a dedicated scanner but now usable.

Ich habe natürlich nicht alle Funktionen ausprobiert, halt nur das, was mir wichtig ist.Der 4500 mA Akku hält bei mir ungefähr 2 – 3 Tage, allerdings schaue ich nicht minütlich darauf und höre auch wenig Musik über das Smartphone.Der Qualcom 865 lässt alle Anwendungen schnell und flüssig arbeiten. Ich habe interessehalber Filme gesehen und es gab kein Ruckeln und die Farben waren sehr angenehm.Kurz nach der Inbetriebnahme wurde Android 11 ausgerollt. Die Oberfläche gefällt mir gut und ich habe die wichtigsten Apps auf der Startseite angeordnet. Die Facebook-App ist für mich uninteressant und konnte ohne Probleme deinstalliert werden.Als Sicherheitsfunktion nutze ich den Fingerabdrucksensor, ein Passwort und die Anbindung an einen Samsung-Account.  Das Scannen des Abdruckes verlief ohne Probleme.Wichtig waren mir die Fotofunktionen und die dazugehörende Foto-App. Da ich mit verschiedenen DSLR-Kameras fotografiere und auch Bildbearbeitung beherrsche, kann ich die Möglichkeiten der Kamera einschätzen. Die Kamera fotografiert im JPEG- und RAW-Modus bei entsprechenden Einstellungen. Der neue HEIF-Modus sagt mir jetzt noch nicht so viel.Ich hatte vorher das LG 4, welches schon eine sehr gute Kamera mitbrachte. Das Samsung S 20 FE übertrifft das alte Gerät bei Weitem. Kritik zum ""Kamerabuckel"" trifft bei mir nicht zu. Wie immer nutze ich eine Lederhülle von Stilgut. Der Kameraausschnitt und alle anderen Ausschnitte sitzen dort perfekt. Das Smartphone hat übrigens werksseitig eine Schutzfolie auf dem Glas, mehr brauche ich nicht, alles ist gut geschützt. Alle ""Plastikanmutung"" haben mit dieser Hülle keine Bedeutung. Ich sehe und fühle sie schlichtweg nicht.Die Farben sind sehr natürlich und eher dezent. Bei gutem Licht gelingen die Fotos immer. Sie sind scharf und es gibt keinerlei Unschärfen durch Wackeln. Selbst bei Fotos mit wenigem Licht, gelingt eigentlich alles sehr gut. Ich habe mal abends beim Fernsehen (55""Flat), 40%tigem Deckenlicht plus einer gedimmten LED Standleute fotografiert und die Kamera hat den großen Kontrastumfang spielend bewältigt. Schatten hatten immer noch Zeichnung, die hellen Stellen waren nicht überbelichtet, die Farbe fast wie im Original. Ich fand das erstaunlich und habe mit dem HDR-Modus, ohne und Nachtaufnahme experimentiert. Die Unterschiede waren geringfügig und sind halt manchmal auch Geschmackssache. Selfies werden natürlich wiedergegeben. Ein großer Unterschied zu den Fähigkeiten des LG G4, welches da immer unvorteilhaft und unnatürlich ""geglättet"" hat.Die Fotoapp ist umfangreich und im Pro-Modus lassen sich viele individuelle Einstellungen vornehmen, bis hin zum komplett manuellen Einstellen. Die Software erkennt bestimmte Motive wie Essen, Blumen, Gesichter, Bewegung etc. Kann man nutzen, ist nicht unbedingt erforderlich. Wer sich etwas in der Technik der Fotografie auskennt, kann die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten der Kamera und der dazugehörigen Software nutzen und ausprobieren. Macht richtig Spaß und mehr braucht man nicht. Für alles andere nutze ich halt dass ""große Equipment"".Telefonieren ist in Ordnung: Der Klang ist angenehm und die Sprache verständlich und laut genug. Musikhören: Die Lautsprecher kommen in Relationen zu ihrer Winzigkeit akzeptabel rüber. Ich vergleiche sie natürlich nicht mit meinen Canton-Boxen und einer HiFi-Anlage.Was hat mir noch gefallen: RAM und interner Speicher sind für mich völlig ausreichend. Ich überspiele halt auch mal Fotos auf mein NAS. Das interne Benutzerhandbuch ist sehr umfangreich und nützlich. Ich kann es nur empfehlen, wenn man mal die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten und Funktionen des S20 kennenlernen und vielleicht nutzen möchte. Ach ja, ich habe die 5G-Version und bin hoffentlich etwas für die Zukunft gerüstet?Was hat mir nicht gefallen: Eigentlich nur die fehlenden Kopfhörerbuchse. Ich habe mir den originalen Samsung USB-C Kopfhörer Adapter bestellt und hören per Kopfhörer mit Kabel funktioniert nicht. Der Sennheiser Momentum Stecker wackelt auch in der Buchse und es ist halt nichts zu hören. Vielleicht mache ich etwas falsch? Über Bluetooth habe ich es noch nicht ausprobiert, da ich keinen entsprechenden Kopfhörer habe. Ansonsten funktioniert Bluetooth aber und ich kann Spotify über meine Anlage und auch über die MusiCast App hören und steuern.Fazit: Tolles Smartphone ohne wirkliche Einschränkungen. Ich habe es zudem über ein ""Angebot des Tages"" günstig erworben. Ich persönlich kann es nur empfehlen und vermisse nichts und bin der Meinung, dass Samsung ein großer Wurf gelungen ist. Ich würde mal sagen, es ist vielleicht nicht ""State of the Art"", aber absolut ausreichend und ein Mehr muss dann viel teurer erkauft werden und ist vielleicht  auch wenig sichtbar bzw. nutzbar.Ergänzung: Ich benutze das S20 jetzt seit über 2 Jahren täglich. Nach ca. einem Jahr ist die Taste zum Ein- und Ausschalten herausgefallen. Samsung hat das im Rahmen der Garantie repariert und das Gerät hat ein neues Gehäuse bekommen. Das S20 hat inzwischen ein Update auf die Version 13 erhalten.

Wir haben ein neues robustes und technisch absolut brauchbares Outdoorsmartphone erhalten und für unsere Bedürfnisse, ein stabiles und funktionelles neues Smartphone gefunden, den erweiterbaren Arbeitsspeicher möchte ich nicht mehr missen! Bei dem Preis denke ich läuft das alles auf einem sehr fairen Niveau ab! ✅Wir haben das Oukitel Smartphone nun seit gut einer Woche in Nutzung und sind sehr begeistert und das doch entgegen der Erfahrungen manch anderer Kunden, die gerne bemängeln, dass die Outdoorhandys, abgesehen von CAT und Co., zu langsam und nicht wirklich funktional wären.Da ich bereits einige andere Outdoorsmartphones hatte, darunter auch drei Oukitel sowie über 20 Monate das Blackview BV6000, denke ich das hier schon einen kleinen Erfahrungsvorsprung haben dürfte.Wir (mein Sohn und ich) haben uns das Smartphone zuschicken lassen mit dem Wissen, dass unabhängig davon sich doch bis dato alle mir bekannten Outdoor-Smartphones nach ein gemeinsames Schicksal teilen. Die Outdoorfähigkeit ging immer zulasten der Performance.💡Dies hat sich mit der neuen Generation an Geräten seit 2022 (siehe z. B. Ulefone Power Armour 13) doch erheblich geändert und man wird nun, so wie ich auch aktuell, viel Freude an seinem Gerät haben.Ganz ehrlich – ich bin von dem hier gebotenen Outdoorgerät, welches wir in unserer Werkstatt, im Garten und am Wochenende zum Geocaching nutzen bei dem aktzeptablen Preis absolut zufrieden.Der erste Eindruck:Es liegt wesentlich geschmeidiger und dennoch Massiv in der Hand, teilwiese hatten wir schon Brocken in Nutzung bei denen man das Telefonieren alternativ zum Hanteltraining hätte nutzen können..Optik/Haptik des Geräts:Das Smartphone liegt, wie bereits beschrieben, mir sehr gut in der Hand, vorausgesetzt man möchte auch etwas zum zu packen haben!Die optische und haptische Beschaffenheit des Gehäuses gefallen mir, das merkt man innerhalb der ersten Sekunden. Das Balancing passt einfach!Es ist für meine Begriffe extrem gut verarbeitet und fühlt sich sehr wertig an. Achteckig und akuraten Bumpern versehen.Alles gut gegen Dreck und Feuchtigkeit abgedichtet. Im Vergleich zum Blackview ist hier der USB-Slot auch soweit vorgezogen, dass man mit jedem herkömmlichen USB-Stecker heran kommen dürfte. Das sollte Standard werden!Die Rückkamera welche mit einer 48 Megapixel Cam bestückt ist und der 8 MP Frontkamera runden den ersten zufriedenstellenden und durchaus Zweckmäßigen Eindruck ab. Auch hier sei angemerkt, dass Nachtaufnahmen (der Night Vision Modus) mit dem WP50 Pro recht gut zu machen sind, Wunder allerdings sollte man aber hier nicht erwarten. Da muss man schon tiefer in die Tasche greifen!Bei normalen Tageslicht bin ich mit den Bildern zu 95 Prozent zufrieden.Das Display ist so gut verbaut, dass es auch kleinere Stürze problemlos aushält ohne direkt in tausend Teile zu Zerspringen. Das Displayglas ist ordentlich robust (CGG5) und hat nebenbei noch eine sehr angenehm gleitend leichte Haptik.Bedienung/Technik:Das Smartphone muss bei der ersten Inbetriebnahme natürlich erstmal ordentlich geladen werden. Hierzu ist zu bemerken, dass der Akku im Gerät fest verbaut wurde. Dieser Umstand ist der Outdoortauglichkeit geschuldet. Das Smartphone benötigt bei Komplettentladung ca. 2 Std.-2,5 Std.Stunden um wieder auf der Höhe zu sein.Das Smartphone verfügt über einen 256 GB großen internen Speicher. Der Arbeitsspeicher hat satte 4+8 GB RAM, welcher über Virtual Ram ergänzt werden kann (zieht dann aber auch etwas an der Akku-Leistung). Das war bisher immer ein Manko gewesen und war meiner Meinung nach auch mal längst überfällig.Betrieben wird das Gerät mit Android 14, welches erwartungsgemäß ohne Einschränkungen sehr ordentlich läuft.Bluetooth:Die Verbindung zu meiner PKW-Freisprecheinrichtung,Kopfhörern sowie diversen Bluetooth-Lautsprecherboxen funktioniert prima. Das Pairing erfolgt binnen weniger Sekunden und ist Stabil und mit älteren Geräten auch abwärtskompatibel nutzbar. Hier zum Beispiel mit meinem Teufel Lautsprecher.GPSErwartungsgemäß, da dies ein Herausstellungsmerkmal der Oukitel Telefone ist, funktioniert das GPS auf dem Gerät einwandfrei. GPS unter freiem Himmel funktioniert in der Regel locker unter 10 Sekunden.Leistung/Gaming/VideosDie verbaute Hardware macht das Spielen mittelgroßer Games am Smartphone recht flüssig und eigentlich ohne merkliche Leistungseinbußen möglich. Aufwendige Games zehren an der Performance und hier kann es dann und wann schon mal zu „Hängepartien“ kommen.Klasse hingegen ist das schauen von Videos via YouTube und Co..Die folgenden Video Formate werden durch das Telefon unterstützt AAC, AMR, AMR-NB, GSM-AMR, eAAC+, aacPlus v2, HE-AAC v2, MIDI, MP3, WMA und WAV und die Audio Formate 3GPP, AVI, H263, H264, MPEG4, MP4, WMV und Xvid.Der Akku:Bei dem fest verbauten Akku handelt es sich um einen 6500 mAh starken Lithium-Ionen-Akku. Dies ergibt nach Komplettladung eine durchschnittliche Handynutzung ca. - 1,5-2 Tagen.Das Display:Die Arbeit mit dem Display funktioniert auch unter freiem Himmel sehr gut. Die Auflösung ist mit 720x1612 gestochen scharf! Das gilt für den allgemeinen Betrieb genauso wie für Filme und Fotos. Der Blickwinkel ist passabel weit und wie bei den bekannten Markengeräten. Das gilt vor allem beim Blick von schräg oben. Definitiv mehr als ein plumpes Baustellentelefon! Zudem unterstützt es GPS+GLONASS+Beidou+Galileo.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'julien  robert', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on 9 October 2024', 'Review Body': ""Bon choix d'achat entre mon besoin et son prix , correspond parfaitement à mes attentes , fonction securité renforcée empreinte digitale et reconnaissance faciale , assez intuitif et simple d'utilisation avec Android 👍\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Kunde', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on 29 September 2024', 'Review Body': 'Schneller Versand alles wie in der Beschreibung und noch 2Jahre Garantie obendrauf.Gutes Preis Leistung Verhältnis.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Stefano', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Italy on 20 September 2024', 'Review Body': ""Forse un po' lento rispetto a quello che mi aspettavo e non supporta la carica wireless.

Showcasing a catalogue of awe-inspiring features, this phone doesn't just meet expectations—it surpasses them.The first thing that strikes you about the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is its blazing-fast performance. Multitasking and app usage are seamless experiences, reinforcing the device's superiority. Its multimedia capabilities don't disappoint either—with brilliant picture quality and immersive sound, it’s tailor-made for a top-tier media consumption experience.OnePlus's collaboration with the esteemed camera company, Hasselblad, has culminated in a unique Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. This partnership has accelerated innovation in mobile photography, featuring natural color calibration. The potent combination of a primary 48 MP camera, a 50 MP ultra-wide camera, a telephoto lens, and a monochrome camera guarantees breathtaking photos. This impressive camera suite shines even in challenging, low-light conditions.But the delights of the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G are not confined to photography. The smartphone features a 6.7-inch Smart 120Hz AMOLED display, enriched with LTPO technology, delivering a fluid and vivid viewing experience. Remarkably, the display achieves a 120Hz refresh rate while consuming up to 50% less power—an undeniable testament to its superior engineering.The innovative Warp Charge technology is another standout feature. Equipped with a 4500 mAh battery, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G exhibits astonishing charging speeds—jumping from 1% to 70% in a mere 30 minutes with Warp Charge 65T. Not to be outdone, the wireless charging capability is equally fast, promising a full day's worth of power in just 15 minutes.Under the hood, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform, delivering a 25% boost in overall performance over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 865. It operates on OxygenOS 11, known for its clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.However, perfection is elusive, and the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is not exempt from minor shortcomings. Users have reported occasional bugs and issues with the Oxygen OS, although these are likely to be addressed in forthcoming updates. The placement of the fingerprint sensor could also be optimized for greater accessibility.Pros:  • Extraordinary camera performance due to Hasselblad partnership.  • Fluid and vibrant display enabled by LTPO technology.  • Incredible charging speed, courtesy of Warp Charge 65T and wireless charging.  • High-octane performance powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform.  • Aesthetically pleasing design and excellent build quality.Cons:  • Potential bugs and issues with Oxygen OS.  • The fingerprint sensor's placement could be improved for easier access.In conclusion, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G represents the apex of smartphone technology, offering an extraordinary camera experience, unparalleled performance, and a breathtaking display. A few minor flaws aside, this phone is a compelling contender for anyone seeking a flagship device with state-of-the-art features. It delivers on its promises, making it a worthy addition to the top tier of the smartphone market.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone at a bargain price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2024', 'Review Body': 'Great phone and a bargain at £209 through Amazon on Prime day.

Avoid!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2021', 'Review Body': ""Original review below for comparison. Good hardware still needs good software and in this regard Oneplus have failed with their android 12 roll out. After 3 beta tests the stable release broke some essential features (like mobile signal...) And removed some existing ones (One plus have now withdrawn the update for further work). If you need a new phone get a pixel 6 or an S21 instead.Old review:Good things (coming from an s20 ultra)-Latest Snapdragon chip-The matte finish on the back is better than shiny glass.-Fingerprint reader is very fast and much more accurate than my last phone.-Oxygen OS is close enough to stock android to use as is (sooo much better than One UI).-Supplied wired charger is superfast!-Camera is pretty good so far. I prefer not having super saturated photos as I did with the s20 ultra.-Comes with a case-Battery life is good, the phone lasts me the day.-Cheaper than a Samsung-The whole throttling thing-Despite that it can get quite hot under heavy load.-One+ are apparently merging oxygen OS with Colour OS and future updates will be based on that.-Not much clarity on the number of OS updates for the device (Samsung are actually good at this now, how things change).-No SD card slot or headphone jack.I guess I'm happy enough. I think the days of new phones surprising with design or new features are long gone. This is a good device with a few drawbacks that will nonetheless do very well for most people at a slightly lower pricepoint than its competitors.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kristie white', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Silky smooth handset.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2024', 'Review Body': ""I managed to get the OnePlus 9pro on sale , I've had previous handsets of OnePlus in the past and they have always been excellent phones, this is no different..

Ich selber bin eiglentlich einer der immer das neuste vom neusten und beste vom besten haben muss, überhaupt im Bereich der Elektronik bzw. bei meinem PC. Wenn es um ein Smartphone geht, bin ich relativ genügsam, da ich nicht die höchsten Anforderungen an ein neues Smartphone stelle.Es muss reaktionsschnell sein, gute Fotos schießen und kleinere Spiele flüssig darstellen und das alles macht das oneplus 9 Pro problemlos. Mit meiner Spiegelreflexkamera kann das Smartphone zwar nicht mithalten aber das erwarte ich mir auch nicht. Im Vergleich zu dem oneplus 7 Pro, ist das 9 Pro noch ein wenig stärker und die 120Hz machen sich im Vergleich zu den 90 beim 7 Pro, alleine beim scrollen bemerkbar. Einfach nur sehr flüssig und geschmeidig. Nebenbei wird das oneplus 9 Pro auf Leistung nicht so heiß wie das 7 Pro, was auch ein sehr guter positiver Effekt ist. Das Display ist gestochen scharf und bietet etwas mehr Helligkeit als das 7 Pro. Die HDR Leistung ist bei dem 9 Pro ebenfalls um einiges besser.Da viele Leute die Akkulaufzeit als den größten Kritikpunkt des 9 Pro's betrachten, war ich schon sehr gespannt wie dieser ausfällt und ich war eigentlich positiv überrascht. Der Akku hält bei minimaler Benutzung ca. 3 Tage. Bei normaler Benutzung, also hin und wieder Spielen und im Internet Surfer ca. 2 Tage und bei starker Benutzung etwas unter einen Tag. Insgesamt ist der Akkuverbrauch im Gegensatz zu meinem 7 Pro aber gleichauf, somit habe ich hier nicht wirklich etwas zu kritisieren.Das oneplus 9 Pro ist einfach nochmal ein verbessertes 7 Pro und in allen Belangen ein wenig besser. Ich wollte mir schon fast das 10 Pro oder 11 bestellen, bin aber froh das ich mir doch das 9 Pro genommen habe.\xa0Um den akutellen Preis von 300-450 Euro, ist das 9 Pro jeden Cent Wert!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'andres', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 9 March 2023', 'Review Body': 'el vendedor esta ofreciendo productos en mal estado y luego no se hace responsable de estos fallos.Alega cualquier escusa para cubrar un % de este si o si.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Francisco B', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on 3 November 2022', 'Review Body': 'Telefone incrível!
