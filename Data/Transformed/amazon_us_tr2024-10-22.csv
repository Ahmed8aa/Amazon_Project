I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'bolo919', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'After much research, trial and error, I bought this phone for several reasons:  1) Good screen size.. prefer the larger screen size than s23 or  s23 fe; 2) Adequate/decent performance specs of processor, camera etc 3) Expandable storage 4) Lowest SAR (radiation) values of any modern Esim phone Ive researched.. Yes i know they say its safe non-ionizing radiation... blah blah.. they said smoking and lead paint were ok too. I use my phone A lot.. tell it to the next guy buddy lol.  5) Price was reasonable enough. Anyway, the phone has been generally amazing so far, much faster and smoother than my old one.  Beautiful screen, although every once in a while some text has a barely noticeable very slight flicker on certain apps/ scripts? I shut off adaptive display something or other, which helped, but again barely noticeable and almost never happens.  Generally amazing, very fast, vibrant, and smooth thanks to the quality display and fast refresh rate.  I used a usb-c flash drive along with Samsung\'s ""Smart switch"" app to backup my old phone (motorola) then transfer onto the A35.  Esim setup was a breeze on US mobile\'s warp (verizon) network - so long as you have *this model* of the A35, which is the US Version (The US Version is A356u, NOT the cheaper latin american/ international A356E.. and probably also the international A55 could have compatibility issues too.. I dont know - I believe the a55 is only available in an international version - Samsung wants you to buy thd s23 fe instead.. The US unlocked models will have the best compatibility with your carrier if u live in the US - yes they are more expensive... anyway I digress)  So far this phone has been generally great.  I have purchased another one to have two lines on the A35.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Baltazar A.

Now, unless you’re a hardcore mobile gamer—like the type who could probably win a Fortnite match with your eyes closed—this phone should have more than enough juice for your everyday needs.For daily use, the A35 performs solidly. Its camera is decent, letting you capture everything from quick snapshots to carefully curated social media posts. And as for Samsung’s OneUI, Android purists might groan about the customizations, but I’m all for it. It’s a far cry from the old days of TouchWiz (anyone else remember that colorful chaos?), and now OneUI adds genuinely useful features like battery charging optimization that’s kinder to your battery health—something stock Android doesn’t offer out of the box, and you probably can’t just add on afterward, either. Plus, Samsung promises four major updates for the A35, which is impressive for a budget phone in this class, especially when competitors in this price range often tap out after one—if you’re lucky!The A35 also includes SD card support, so you’ve got plenty of space for photos, music, and all your favorite memes. My one real gripe? No raw API support for the camera. I mean, my cheaper Galaxy A9+ tablet has it—so what’s the deal, Samsung?At this price point, you could go for a flagship, but you’d be looking at the price of two A35s—or even three! For me, the A35 hits that perfect sweet spot of not-too-cheap and not-too-expensive. It’s affordable enough that you won’t feel like you need to keep it in a bulletproof case, but powerful enough that you won’t feel like you’re carrying around a paperweight. Overall, I’d say the A35 is like that dependable friend who always shows up with snacks but never leaves you broke.\nRead more'}]",25.062656641604008,B0CV4NH5T9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CV4NH5T9,5g

And the reason it's a piece of junk is because Motorola has messed with the basic Android that Google supplies and calls it Motorola Android and Motorola has no competent programmers to be messing on anything that Google puts out for programming on phones. These people were not even smart enough to put in a selection to look at all the apps that are installed. They only put in a selection to look at the most recent apps in the default apps. The standard Google Android has both. I'm trying to save you from wasting five or six hours of your life trying to set up with this thing so that it'll actually work and has the stuff that was on your old phone to use. I'm going to add to this that the notifications have stopped working properly. You spend more time trying to administer this phone instead of being able to actually use it to get any work done. And I would never ever consider doing any online banking with a piece of crap phone like thisUpdate when I got this phone somebody had set the gestures attached to the power button to turn on Google Assistant instead of restarting the phone. It's taken me numerous hours to finally figure out how to fix this issue. In my opinion this was not a new phone but it was advertised as new.Update 9/4/24 This phone is like all the other g series I have owned since 2022 which is 3 of them.  All of them have this uncontrolled scolling problem where the screen will all of a sudden scroll at speed up or down. This has been a problem with the last 4 Motorola phones I have had.

I purchased my original Moto 5G in 2019 and for a very long time I was very hesitant in replacing it with a newer version. Even though I did consider briefly buying a Moto 7G Phone in 2022 but I just wasn’t impressed with the unusual changes Motorola made just to make it look and work “different”. However, when I first saw this 2023 Version I was very happy to see that a lot things were back to the way I remembered them before changes they made to the Interface were actually ones that I liked. Such as Swiping down on the Homescreen “twice” instead of “once” to Auto-Rotate the Screen, which I used to accidentally do all the time. I know that something like this is very minor but it’s just one of the many ways Moto rethought the Interface to be more user-friendly.IMPORTANT POINTS:  This Phone has a Three-Day Battery Life, which is truly excellent! The feel, the weight and the look of it is really nice and it fits in my hand and pocket perfectly. The Display Screen and Refresh Rate is top notch and the Performance is Fantastic! Another BIG PLUS for me is that it has a 256GB of Storage as compared to 128GB. Also this Phone still has a Headphone Jack (Yay!) and it comes with a Phone Charger in the Box, which the 2024 Version does NOT have.THE ONLY NEGATIVE: For some reason Motorola thought that I wanted to have Tik-Tok and another App already Installed and it was difficult to remove it. By the way, I heard that the Moto g Power 5G 2024 has A LOT more of these Applications ALREADY installed, which is absolutely something I do NOT want at all.NOTE: I intentionally did NOT purchase the 2024 Version of the Moto g Power 5G partially because of the “reimagined” Interface, nor all of the massive amount of ALREADY installed “Bloatware” I’ve been reading about. Also, since I am very concerned about Security, I did NOT want the New NFC (Near Field Communications) which would include my Credit Card, Tap to Pay and other Financial information on my Cellphone. Although, I would have liked to have the New Wireless Charging Feature but it was something I able to live without.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'jeremy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything is Great, but please read if buying 2023 version', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Everything works fine. Very solid phone. Supports 5g. What\'s to complain?? Well, for me it\'s the charge speed. In this day & age not having fast charging is a sin. I will be keeping the 2023 version as a backup phone or might just return it. Just ordered the 2024 version which supposedly supports fast charging & wireless charging. Been charging this phone since I got it & it\'s been about 3 hours or so. I went from 40% to 61%. Literally as I\'m typing this. Just had to let people know since no one talked about it at all. If this isn\'t an issue for you, then this phone is your perfect phone. Otherwise I use my phone a lot so needing a full 5-6 hours to fully charge your phone daily is not ideal for me. Most reviews say Battery life seems to be quite good. Just the charge process seems bad. For me at least. I like to go out occasionally & knowing my phone will not easily charge fast should it hit zero doesn\'t put me at ease. For example like camping & using GPS or even using it to play music. In my experience phones will eventually die after a full day regardless of battery life. Meaning it will take at least 3-4 hours to hit 0% to 20%. Sorry, for the long scenario review. I just wished this product said it wasn\'t compatible with fast charging. Although to be fair it never said it did.Hope this helps anyone to make a solid decision on buying the ""2023"" version of the Moto G Power. This is a solid phone, just a bit of a relic in charge technology.-Originally 3 Star Review**Update**9/16/20242023 version works solid. Only been 2 days but I\'ve gotten the gist of it. It\'s definitely going to be my backup phone. No changes since my initial review. Battery life is standard. I don\'t play gaming apps much anymore so I can\'t say how gaming potential really is. Maybe someone else will do a stress test in regards to that. Still I\'m a bit bummed about the no NFC & charging seems to have gotten better. A bit inconsistent with charge speed, but maybe it\'s just me or it doesn\'t like my lightning cables. otherwise very solid phone. Overall review 8.5/10. Perfect if you aren\'t too nit picky about tech & current accessibility.2024 Version. Yeah, as I thought. Just using it I can feel it\'s more up to speed with modern times. Has NFC. Wireless Charge Capabilities. Camera is pretty good. Solid overall. With all the bells & whistles on battery life is good. I mean could optimize it to performance mode but what\'s the fun in that?? Otherwise this is a straight upgrade from the 2023 version. I wouldn\'t call it perfect, but I can say I can recommend it without hesitation. Definitely better than the LG G8 Thinq I had & I absolutely loved the LG G series. Oh & having the fingerprint scanner to the side where the power button is located is a nice feature. Although screen shots are a bit awkward if you try to use traditional inputs. This phone offers a shortcut. When placing 3 fingers (imagine a dog/cat paw formation) on the screen it will take a screenshot.  Although the emergency override with +Volume & Power button are both on one side so that\'s definitely annoying. Probably my only real con. 9.5/10, I would say it\'s a 10 but there are better phones out there. However for the Best bang for your buck. This is definitely a steal.-5 stars for both versions now that I understand what I\'m working with. Unfortunate that I was unsatisfied with the 2023 version, but like I said.

Meanwhile I did a search for ""Moto G Play 2023 User Manual"" and downloaded the 62 page  (very useful) ""User Guide.""  Be sure to get this manual (is is a pdf file) and it is full of  information.  The old SDcard needed to be reformatted and this manual tells how to do this. The Moto G has an Andriod 12 operating system and has ""VOLTE"" which is a requirement in our area for using the local AT&T cell towers.VOLTE give you more range and greater clarity than the old communications protocol. After about 90 minutes of charging I was at 100% and I did the initial; startup procedure  described in the downloaded manual.  The phone connected to the AT&T tower with no problems.  I made my first phone call and the sound level was more than adequate.  I have a hearing disability so I expect most people would say that the phone is \'loud.""  I also downloaded a Kindle book  ($2.99)  that told me details about using Android 12. If you want the book  do a search on the Amazon site for ""Android 12 user manual"".  Most people will not get this manual but I am happy to have the extra information provided in this well-written book about the Android 12 OS.  I bought the Moto play because I needed a phone and did not care about playing games, reading kindle books, or ""living on the phone.""  The Moto G can do all of that but you would be better off to buy a much more advanced unit that costs several time as much as the Moto G.  I much prefer using a separate (large) Kindle for reading, a  dedicated gaming computer,  and  desktop computer with multiple screens for other activities.  Overall, the Moto G does exactly what I wanted (a good phone)  at a reasonable price.  I also downloaded a few apps from the app store and they worked properly.  I rate this phone as being better than expected and well worth the low price.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Pikachu42', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good Quality, Low Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024', 'Review Body': ""We got this for my son who's going into middle school.

LOL  ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn\'t have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I\'ve factory reset twice and they\'re just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON\'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound\'t they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn\'t both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can\'t even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i\'ll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don\'t have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don\'t trust my log in (bc i\'ve got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . .

It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn’t know.I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn’t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my cell service provider.

The battery life is impressive as well, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use without a hitch.Being unlocked and Android-based means I have full control over my device and can switch carriers or customize settings without hassle.

I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone, fast processor 256gb memory at ok price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""When a phone costs $1000 it better be special.

But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ibrahim A.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': '10/10', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': 'okay, it came In a weird packaging so I was suspicious it was absolutely wonderfully packed tho. it came in a small box, iphone in bubble wrap and then a lighting cable to charge in a plastic bag. the screen had no scratches, the back was wonderfully brand new, I chose yellow . It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase!

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Matthew Mills', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'My son loves his phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024', 'Review Body': ""My son's been wanting a iPhone for a long time.

The A15 4G international version definitely works on the Bell network in Canada, and the total cost to get it shipped to my door was around $280 CAD for a phone a little over $160 USD. The phone arrive in perfect condition WITH a phone charger within a few days. I am lifelong Motorola user for my personal phone and have a newish S23 for work. At the USD price of this phone, the A15 4G really does blow away competitor 4G phones at this price range, but I was a bit nervous about leaving my 100% reliable, but super clunky Moto behind.There are a lot of excellent online reviews for the A15 4G/5G, but some of highlights of this international version include full 1080 HD OLED display (which is great), 6 GB of ram (most are 4 GB at this $ range), NFC for financial transactions (less common in sub $200 phones), and the promised extended  support for Android updates / security patches. The 4G is also dual sim, but you have to make a choice with the second slot - either a second sim card OR an SD card for more memory.  Whatever version of the A15 4G/5G phone you purchase, read the phones specs carefully. There are a lot of common features between the various versions of these phones, but differences appear to occur. For instance, the 5G A15 is single sim and Samsung states NFC is region specific. The official version of this phone in Canada only has 4GB of ram at this time.So far this phone has worked extremely well, and it is a user experience that approximates my work S23. You are not going to get a great game experience, world shattering photos or film your YouTube  content with this phone, but it is great for standard phone activities. This is a low end Samsung phone, so that requires a little caution. This phone could well have some unidentified issue that will impact all users (e.g. battery probs. or random rebooting etc.) However, off the starting line, this phone appears to be excellent value.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Lexi’s best', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'The quality is great and it uses two sim', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The size is great and the features the camera quality looks great, easy to use it came unlocked and it’s working great\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great unlocked phone for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Works as advertised.

I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kylee Parker', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Surprisingly Perfect', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I was VERY reluctant to buy a phone off Amazon.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* \U0001fae2 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dona', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people.  I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it.  It is on a carrier that is not one of the ""big names"".  It suits my purposes fine.My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe.  This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there.  Believe me, I tried.  The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone.  I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering.  I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating.  They did not disappoint!The first phone I purchased was purple.  It arrived in excellent condition visually.  No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone.  It charged up to 82% which was great.  Everything was wonderful.  Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user).  I couldn\'t hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion.  Nope, wasn\'t me.MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone.  They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me.  The replacement phone was blue, but that isn\'t an issue.  It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new.  It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a ""new"" phone and to do your research on sellers.

Rear cameras are better in the dark.Speakers are loud, but sounds a little flat to me.Positives: The form factor is nice, even tho a bit smaller than my s22 ultra. Fits perfect in the pocket.The UI is fluid and smooth, animations are nice. The Screen is nice, vivid and bright. The videos are way superior on the Pixel 8 pro, better stabilization, better colors, better zoom than my S22U. Post edit tools are a plus to adjust pics and vids to your preference. Magic eraser does work pretty nice. Cinematic photos are cool. Battery is good. I can go all day without a charge, with heavy usage. NO OVERHEATING issues like some people was saying.Overall, the phone is a great phone with strong cameras to compete with the best flagships in 2024.The only advantage my S22U has is the S-PEN other than that I'm good with the PIXEL 8 PRO. #TEAMPIXEL for life.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Noah', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'From Oneplus 9Pro to Pixel 8, Massive Upgrade', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My old Oneplus 9pro was a handmedown from my dad. It lasted a while, all the way from when it came out. Still not very slow, battery life was definitely lacking on that thing.But this 100% feels like an upgrade. That old phone only went up to Android 13, while this one came with 14. Snapchat makes proper use of the Android camera API for the pixel, so my photos look wayyyy more crisp on this phone. The camera on this phone is a bit meh in comparison to the oneplus I had, but the macro lens is pretty amazing on this phone.I use bitwarden and it would almost never autofill on my oneplus, but this autofills on every single app I\'ve tried, the app integration and amount of random little QoL features are amazing.I\'m not a fan of the default home launcher, but after installing lawn chair 14, I have way more customizability and I was able to really make this phone feel like my own.The battery life is wonderful, I was a bit worried that it wouldn\'t have much because it\'s not the ""pro"" version of the phone but it lasts me ~1.5 days with pretty regular usage. Even while using the 120hz display.The size feels way more comfortable than the the massive oneplus, and I\'m honestly glad I didn\'t get the 8 pro. I have pretty big hands, I don\'t know who they\'re making these huge phones for. If you want to watch movies with a large screen, just get a cheap tablet. This is for messaging and day-to-day usage, and it works perfectly for that. It feels comfortable in the pocket too, paired with the Mous case I bought for it. This phone does everything I need it to, and I have almost no complaints.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Paul K.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Works well and I love the google AI that screens calls.  It's very human sounding and works better than any other call screen service I have ever used.****IMPORTANT NOTE****  Asurion is a scam.  In my experience, If you ever have to file a claim they will make the process as difficult as possible.  When you sign in to the app to file a claim you have to sign in three separate times.  The form they want you to fill out does not self-populate your name, address, phone # etc.  You’ll then need to enter various other information, and they want a pic of both the front and back of your driver’s license (remember, you logged in with a UN and PW).  Once you upload all of this, they tell you it will take 24 business hours to review.  First, they reject the form stating you must print and sign the form even though it says you can sign electronically.  If you call their number, they will place your call on hold for a while and initially an automated message will attempt to tie up your call having you answer various questions.  Eventually someone in a foreign country will answer your call.  The initial person will try to sell you additional services and after you say no a couple times, they will transfer you to someone else.  You guessed it, you will have to be on hold again.  You will get transferred and placed on hold several more times and they will find a way to deny your claim.  What is especially frustrating is you have followed all their directions along the way.  They can (and will) raise service fees without any notice.  In the end, you will not save any money and have spent far too much time submitting forms and talking to people that lie and misdirect you every step of the way.  The company’s employees are dishonest and have no problem lying to you.  You can give it a try if you want but you have been warned.  Instead of paying their monthly fee dump the money in a savings account.  Odds are you’ll be able to buy a new product that’s updated, and you will receive it in a couple of days instead of weeks later.  Asurion Protection is a scam.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'R.A.C.', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Fast and easy set up', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Fast to set up and start using.

The camera takes acceptable shots in light and darker areas for the price range of the phone no big bells or whistles though. Expandable memory! Gotta love phones that still have an microsd slot. Headphone jack? Yep it has that too. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner. So far it has been 100% and zippy quick. Overall, It does what a normal midrange phone should do!On a negative side though, there's a good delay when switching between heavy apps. It's not frustratingly annoying but definitely noticeable. The sound quality isnt the best, even at maximum levels, it's just okay. Colors are not vibrant or vivid, just good... You won't get that crisp 4k imagery when watching videos or viewing high def pictures obviously. Vibrations isn't super strong, no 5g, just as bunch of minor things that can be overlooked.

I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it\'s a renewed phone, it\'s not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it\'s now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I\'ve been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I\'ve always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that\'s a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don\'t know what to do.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jane Ann', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Same quality for less money!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'It was time to upgrade my cell phone, so naturally I reached out to my carrier.

If you need the latest model with the most memory and fastest processor so you can impress your friends and family dog; this isn\'t for you.  For those of us who just want a mobile phone that can text, stream cat videos while you are in boring meetings, or play mindless games so you can distract yourself from what you are supposed to be doing, this is an inexpensive option.  It connects to wifi so you aren\'t burning minutes on your plan for things other than calls and texts  -if you have access to wifi and you set the phone to connect to wifi.  NOTE: The autocorrect keeps changing wifi to wife.  I suggest you don\'t set it to connect to your wife -unless you and your wife are into those kind of things.  No judgment.  I\'ve been avoiding cell phones for years, so I haven\'t kept track.  (Now I need a contract so I can confirm things with texts.  It\'s a conspiracy, man!!!)  I suspect this model was popular a few years ago.  Now it is out of fashion, but still entirely functional.  Combine it with a Tracphone $60.00 per year plan, and you are good to go for occasionally receiving/sending occasional texts, or having a means of contacting people when you aren\'t near your primary phone(s).  You can also disconnect in the middle of a diatribe, and then blame it on having an older model phone.  (I really miss ""hanging-up"", touching the disconnect icon just doesn\'t have the same closure.  Motorola needs to add a sound effect of a phone receiver slamming down when you disconnect.  Hmmm, now that I think of it, it may already exist.  Hmmm, if it doesn\'t exist, maybe I can copyright it.  Be right back, gonna check...  Dang! there are 103 sound effects to download.  I\'ll check them out later to see if there is a slamming phone receiver.  Don\'t steal my idea.)  WARNING: This is a ""locked"" phone.  That means that you must use a Tracphone contract.  If you buy this phone, don\'t complain that an ATT, T-Mobile, or Joe\'s Budget Cell Phone Plan with free fries, doesn\'t work. <shrug>  Sorry, I couldn\'t rate Battery Life or Tech Support.

For it's price, it is a great phone. Even though my previous phone still works great, it is 16 GB and I was running out of memory for apps.  I had to start removing apps as with each update of each app, they seemed to bloat taking up more and more memory.  That led me to needing a new phone with 32 GB of memory which led me to this phone.  Previously I always used LG Tracfones but I read LG is no longer making inexpensive Tracfones which is probably why they are no longer on Tracfone's website.  I always wondered how the Motorola phones were so when I saw this at a great price I bought it.  I have not connected it to Tracfone service yet as I want to have it setup to my liking before I do.  Even though it is still Android there are some differences with the Moto settings and its use of the features that make me prefer the LG phones but nothing that would make me not like it or want to use it.  My only complaint is no where on the Amazon listing for this phone did it say whether it is GSM or CDMA so I don't know whether Tracfone in my area will accept this phone.  The packing list said CDMA but according to Motorola's website it is GSM.  Then I read that Tracfone was bought by Verizon and as of November 2023 Tracfone plans will be changed.  There is some confusion whether Verizon is still CDMA or not.  So I don't know whether I will be able to use this phone after Verizon takes over.  Or whether I would stay with Verizon depending on their pricing policies for previous Tracfone customers.  But it is still a great phone so far.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gregory H.', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazingly good for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Ok, this is NOT an $800+ smart phone, so no one should be comparing it to one.  However, it wasn\'t that long ago that if you spend any less than $250 on a cheaper phone, it was absolute junk.  This (when on sale) is less than $50 and it\'s perfectly usable for many people.  The screen is decently bright and clear even though it\'s not ultra-high res.  You get a basic amount of RAM (3 gig) And storage (32 gig) but you can add a micro SD card to that and use any number of apps that keep junk files cleaned out, etc.  One speaker, but you can\'t expect stereo for this price; it\'s decently loud, though.The cameras are average but in good light the rear one does really well - in lower light, not so much, but if you tweak the pics in a decent photo app you can make them better.  The selfi cam is serviceable.  Video quality tops out at 1080p and is also average.  Tracfone can be hit or miss - they are NOT known for their customer service skills, but generally speaking the service works and there are few outages compared to some others.  If you have an older person who just wants a ""use at times"" phone or a kid who needs their first smart phone, this won\'t break the bank (just PLEASE read up on parental controls on Android before handing one over to a tween/teen!!).Once again - ""for the price"" I rate this phone highly.

My A25 freezes, opens and closes apps on its own, won't keep memory of last app and will restart the app. The screen is unresponsive A LOT. Sometimes the keyboard will not pop up. Other times I'll be typing and all my words get bunched up showing where the spell check words are, but not in any field on the screen. It's so frustrating. Sometimes I have to keep tapping the screen for it to be responsive. Other times it jumps from screen to screen. The battery life is okay, nothing stellar. Sound quality is decent, but I don't care much about that at this point. I have quality ear buds and BT speakers. I've been a Samsung consumer for decades. I've had a handful of awful Samsung phones including the ones Samsung would kill, (had two of the same model and they both died a day or two away from each other) like they were scheduled to be a brick. Took me a while to get good with Samsung again...and here I am. Again. Taking a screen shot is difficult because the power button is too sensitive and the - volume button is not. It takes some finesse. Your experience might be different, but I got a crappy phone it appears. There's also some connectivity issues with LTE.

It began lagging more and more. Storage was full and apps wouldn\'t update because there supposedly wasn\'t enough space, regardless of the size of SD card I installed. The very definition of ""planned obsolescence"". Wanting to avoid this with my next phone, I bought something with more storage and memory this time around.SCREEN:After 2 Galaxy A15\'s had phantom screen press issues I decided to give the A25 a try since online resources suggested it had a different screen. Thankfully I\'ve yet to have any phantom screen press issues about 2 months since receipt.Per gsmarena.com the A15\'s features a 800-nit screen, while the A25 features a 1000-nit screen. The noticeable difference here is that the A25 is actually usable in sunlight. The A15 is too dim. This is very important, and I feel a huge drawback of the A15.BATTERY:I subjectively feel like the A25 runs down the battery a bit faster than the A15. This does make sense given the hardware. Per nanoreview.net the SOC of this phone is more powerful than that of the A15, with a lower battery life rating. Per gsmarena.com the A25 has a 120Hz screen vs. the 90Hz of the A15, while both phones feature 5000 mAh batteries.Either someone at Google decided to finally build battery charge thresholds into Android after 14 versions (better late than never?), or this phone, due to price point and/or hardware, supports them. This should help improve battery lifespan of this phone.Neither the A15 or A25 feature wireless charging. I don\'t care. You might.HARDWARE:I DO care that both feature 3.5mm jacks. They make life so much better. Locating it on the bottom, unlike the A01\'s top-mounted 3.5mm jack, makes it easier to route a cable when it\'s in a pocket or car mount.It supports either dual SIM or one SIM and a microSDXC. This also makes life much better. I wish it could hold 2 SIMs AND a microSDXC at once, but it\'s better than nothing I suppose.The cameras are pretty good, but get grainy/pixelated when zooming in. My camera needs are modest compared to some, so I\'m satisfied.The notch for the front camera is fine. In fact I grew to like the status info (battery, WiFi/cellular, notification icons, etc) being at the top, next to the notch, in the A01, giving more room to apps.The inclusion of stereo loudspeakers is a nice upgrade from the A15, especially considering the price increase. If you hold the phone at an off-angle they can sound strange due to the angle. For best results hold the phone with the screen flat toward your face.It gets a bit warmer than the A15. A quick internet search suggests it\'s the Exynos SOC. Thumbs down.I\'m not particularly tough on my phones, so the plastic construction is fine for me. I put it in a silicone case. This makes it easier to grab, and was potentially far less expensive than buying a phone with metal construction.SIZE:The phone\'s too big*. The A01 was too big at 5.7"", and the A25 is worse 6.5"". I have long fingers and it\'s impossible to reach the top of the screen (where one might find a close or menu button in an app) one-handed without major grip adjustment, risking dropping the phone. The A01 was borderline uncomfortable in the (large) pockets of my pants, the A15/A25 cross the border. Squatting down must be carefully done lest it dig into your hip and cause discomfort or pain. Yes viewing more of web pages is nice. Yes I have to thumb to the next page of ebooks less when there are more words on-screen. Yes, more screen real estate is nice for Google Maps. But I don\'t NEED those things. In fact, I\'d rather have an easier-to-carry PHONE, not a PHABLET I have to buy military cargo pants or a purse to comfortably carry.SOFTWARE:Mostly stable and as-expected: minimal changes to Android and the usual Samsung bloatware. There are some issues but I\'m not sure if I can blame Samsung.1. Expo Go (an app used for mobile app development) doesn\'t allow interaction with the app I\'m helping develop. Expo Go itself works fine on both the A15 and A25, but the in-development app would appear frozen. The in-development app works perfectly on Expo Go on the A01.2. ** 2nd Edit: The issue has resurfaced, and I\'ve had to switch to a different camera app. Edit: this issue appears to have been resolved, perhaps via one of the updates the phone received since I wrote about it. Original issue text: ""I set the ""side button"" (power button) to turn on the flashlight when double-pressed. Using the included camera app before using the side button to turn on the flashlight results in the flashlight not working. This can be fixed by clearing the camera app\'s cache every time you want to use the flashlight, or using a different camera app. For all I know there\'s a fix for these, but I haven\'t found it yet (and I\'ve looked).""3. Some third-party apps fail to start and require a second screen tap.VALUE:This phone is exiting the budget segment toward mid-range, but you get more for your money compared to an entry-level phone. More computing power, more storage and memory, an ultrawide camera, stereo speakers, a better screen than the A15, while retaining a 3.5mm jack.*But ""the market"" wants big phones (see the Marques Brownlee video ""Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them"" video for more).\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Passingby', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'the best phone for the $$$$', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've only had it for a few days now and it's hurting me to send it back because someone got me the s24 Plus for free BUT BUY THIS PHONE!!!. it feels and runs like a high end phone, I loved the pictures it took and the all around feel of it.

I was an hour away from our house and received a call from my wife. Signal wasn't the greatest but at least I could understand her. When I went to leave, I opened Google Maps to show me the way home.

Restarted phone and magically, everything was ok!3 - Samsung music player in new phones does not play WMA files where the Samsung player in my old A51 would.I can't believe I spent this much money on a phone that I apparently need to restart every few days to get it to function properly and to restart it when I go out of range (I was only 1 county over).I may get iPhone next time or if an Android, definitely NOT Samsung.\nRead more""}]",16.722408026755854,B0CN1Q2X3B,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CN1Q2X3B,5g

I\'m someone who isn\'t picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I\'d honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn\'t so hard to get by in today\'s day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I\'m not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn\'t obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don\'t know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I\'m sure it isn\'t the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don\'t worry, I clear them when I\'m done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it\'s pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I\'ve seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality. Not sure what you\'d get out of the more expensive ones, but I\'m more than happy with what I\'ve got here.TL;DR: if you ""just need a phone that works,"" get this one!

I was looking for something that wasn\'t one of the mainstream brands like Samsung, Apple, etc. I like the features (decent storage, can use external storage, large screen, comes unlocked, good battery life with quick charging, various widgets, so many settings, and more) and the lack of ""bloatware"" that comes with the phone.There are 2 things that I don\'t like about the phone compared to my last one (Google Pixel 3).1, that I was aware of from other reviews, is the camera is not the best. Sometime you need some really good light for the picture to come out decent, otherwise pictures can be rather dark. I find myself editing them often to brighten them up. That and it lacks the crispness that you can get with phones like the Google Pixel and others. Besides that, it has some cool camera options, like professional mode (which if I learned how to use that I\'m sure my images would come out a bit brighter), macro, others, and some of the editing tools are pretty cool.And 2, something that bugs me enough to note it here, is the responsiveness of the screen. I don\'t think it is an app issue as it has happened with multiple apps, but sometimes while swiping in a direction, it doesn\'t always respond the way I want it to. For example, I use Spotify very frequently, and it\'s where I get annoyed at this issue the most. In Spotify, when you are viewing a song you can swipe from right to left to change a song, or swipe down to get out of the song view, taking you back to a menu screen. So many times, it does not register my swipe to the left, instead it registers it as a downswipe, exiting the screen I was on. And like I said, this happens with other apps too, where I\'m trying to swipe across, but instead it registers as a downswipe exiting the screen I was on.Other than the 2 issues I have with this phone, it\'s honestly great for the price. I\'m disappointed with the camera sometimes, but that is coming from my previous phone\'s camera being so crisp and bright, and I also knew about it based on the other reviews I read. And the swiping issue can be annoying, but it is tolerable.Overall decent phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tadeo Herrera', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 11, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Los atributos están a la altura de un gama alta.. la velocidad y su estética los mejores y no se diga la calidad de la cámara y el sonido por el precio es excelente !!!\nRead more'}]",,B0C22BRGLG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C22BRGLG,5g

Unlocked for your phone carrier and you could also unlock the bootloader too and root, install custom roms etc. I bought this at the time since it was one of the last oneplus phones that gave customers access to msm tools which allows you to restore your phone if you somehow mess up installing custom roms. The phone is fast, amoled screen looks nice and crisp. The snapdragon 888 processor is fast but it does heat up. I've rooted the phone and simply underclock it so it actually stays nice and cool all the time and even extends the battery life.If you're deciding between an older flagship and a midrange phone, I think pretty much you're always going to get a better deal with an older flagship (betters specs) unless you need a specific feature from a budget phone like sd card or phone jack.My only real complaint about this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. It's not as fast as back fingerprint readers but I can't blame oneplus as android a whole has moved towards using in-display finger readers.

Having read about One Plus Oxygen being an open source port of Android that gets pretty good reviews I decided to go for the One Plus 9 5G. My carrier is Google Fi, and I was so disappointed they started selling Samsung phones, of which I'm not a fan at all.First thing I noticed after purchasing it was the fit and finish is quite nice. It's not a brick, not svelte per se, but it has a good weight to it. The width was a welcome change from the Pixel 3XL. That minor reduction in width made this much more capable as a single hand phone. I'm not one to really care about fingerprints but you will get fingerprints all over the back and the face...again, whatevs.The speed. Out of the gate, when I dropped my Google Fi sim into the device the first thing I noticed was the speed. This is a fast tight phone. Which I do appreciate. Especially since my Pixel was on it's last legs and I really did need a replacement that would be a decent upgrade.If you purchase the unlocked version you should be aware of a few settings so your coverage is taking advantage of both WiFi calling/data, and roaming. Which sort of leads me to believe that since you have to make those adjustments in the settings menu. I wonder how many people have purchased the phone and thought, damn my coverage is awful with this thing.  So, I ding them for that....but then, this isn't a on and done purchase. You have to do a bit of finagling with the hardware. Welcome to Android....lol.Charging. WOW...just WOW. I have a 15w wireless charger I used with my Pixel and it charges the One Plus 9 5G...just fine....and...not sure I get why people complain about the wireless charging but in my experience it's just fine. At work I charge it connected to a docking station and.....it's FAST. And that's using my Pixel charging cable.Battery life. I don't think this is intended as a battery sipper. it will go through a full charge in a day. With some room to spare. But overall I wasn't dismayed by the battery life. I've tested it with the various and NUMEROUS battery life extension settings on the phone, some of which are confusing...again...welcome to Android. But I like playing around with stuff like this;Camera. Love it. It's great. I've literally taken shots with my Pixel that I regard as stunning. And in the few weeks I've had the One Plus 9 5G, can't complain at all. If anything, I've noticed a depth of color in both wide  and closer shots that feels more realistic and to be honest I'm kind of shocked at how well the camera works compared to the Pixel 3XL, which...I really loved that camera, a lot. The interface is quite different but it's responsive and the level of tweeking you can do to get your shot is miles apart from the Pixel.What's not so great: Well, on the second week I scratched the screen, Just above the fingerprint sensor. I had it in my pocket with some keys, my bad, and I was kind of surprised it scratched so easily. I've had my Pixel for over 3 years, handling the exact same way and I never experienced that. The screen never had any wear at all. The scratch isn't bad, you can only see it if you look at it at an angle. But still. This concerns me.Fingerprint sensor: hit or miss. It's built into the front of the screen, which is nice. But, it takes multiple tries to unlock, and if your fingers are particularly dry, or just off from the sensor. Yes, you'll get a warning and have to enter your pin after so many tries. To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. But it has been an annoyance a few times.Choices!: There's a LOT to play with in the settings, for me not a big deal at all, for others....gives me pause. Not sure I'd recommend this phone to someone not into having fun with the settings. Or a person that just wants to turn it on a go.File transfers to Mac: It'd be nice if I could connect the phone to my mac to transfer files. The phone automatically offers a USB driver to install when you connect it to a PC. Not so much with a Mac. There was an article on the One Plus website about enabling developer mode so you could enable USB logging so you could do file transfers....tried it, didn't work. Not a deal breaker but.....again, not the most user friendly experience.Conclusion: I like the phone, and I think it'll serve me for what I need it to do. Speed, durability and camera. 5G coverage where I'm at is, spotty, but, have noticed a speed boost when it does show up in the top menu bar...which again...wow, LOADS of icons in the top home screen menu bar...it's kinda funny. And Camera, I used my camera phone on my Pixel all the time. If this phone's camera was lackluster or a compromise I would have sent it back fast.  But from what I've experienced, especially the camera interface, I have a lot to play with and for that I'm excited.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Alexandra Racine', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on October 12, 2023', 'Review Body': ""Pour un Oneplus 9 neuf à 440 $ , le rapport qualité-prix est excellent.Il est rapide et j'aime la détection du visage.

Zorach', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very Happy With This So Far: Great Phone for Great Price, But Some Key Downsides', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I\'ve been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it\'s a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.Things I like about this phone: it\'s relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It\'s great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don\'t like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can\'t make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It\'s a big downside because now I can\'t use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don\'t have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it\'s not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It\'s not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry. I refuse to pump big money into an industry that isn\'t representing my values and the things I care about in life.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jessie Asuncion', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Worked like a charm', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024', 'Review Body': 'My last purchase on Amazon  with a refurbished phone, I got totally burned.

The RF performance of this phone seems to allow it to get a workable signal where other phones do not.  I was often in areas which seemed to have no to marginal coverage.  Now with this phone they all seem workable.  Casually comparing its performance to other kinds of phones in use in the same area by others on various networks, this phone will typically be able to make calls when others cannot.  It is clearly better than the phone it replaced.  Perhaps it is realted to Motorola being an old line radio company.  Who knows.  But it is a superior RF performer.I tested using different SIM cards and it works with both Verizon and T-Mobile (a GSM carrier) networks.  This is pretty unusual because most phones are either Verizon or GSM but not both.  The phone is advertised as working with ALL US carriers and this seems to be a good claim.  Maybe the thing is an SDR?  Wouldn\'t that be nice.The wifi section has both 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands.  Both work very well.  Using a directional beam as the access point I was able to get a workable 2.4 link at about a half mile.  If you want to play with this I used a Ubiquiti Powerbeam PBE M2 400 which you can get on Amazon.The phone is also very stable, having not yet crashed after a few months of use.  The phone comes with Android 11, which is very good and it will ask you to upgrade to 12.  Both versions are excellent and stable on this phone.  There are no hangs or crashes.The memory holds all the apps I need and is only about 60% used.  Battery life can go way past two days if you are just on standby and have all the saver features turned on.  The two days is with ""normal"" use as in my kind of normal use versus playing games or watching video all day.  Charging is quite fast and considering you can run a day with far less than 100% battery, the time to refresh the battery is quite quick.The camera is average, which in my case is good enough, but keep in mind it\'s a cell phone.  If you want to do real photography get a DSLR.For the money you will not find a better deal.

Styli? Not sure the plural for that. But they are just rubber bumps at the end that mimic the capacitor touch of a finger. Been playing Trauma Center and the accuracy is nearly perfect, and what imperfections there are might be down to the game or emulator rather than the phone. My only real complaint, and an issue I've never really had before even on cheaper phones, is that it starts to lag as I type long blocks of text. Eventually being nearly unusable. I bypass this by just copypasting my current text into a notepad document each time the lag starts and then pasting the lot of it back when I'm done (had to do that once while typing this review) so I'm not sure what's up there. Otherwise great phone.

I use the POWER version of this phone myself and had confidence that it would be a good upgrade from a basic as a first smart phone.It is an EXCELLENT choice as the screen is large and you can configure everything so as not to be too confusing for a non tecchie. The phone call performance is excellent with good sound quality in both directions. This is NOT the fastest phone or one that has a lot of storage or memory...but I knew that going in and I can always add a big microSD if she ever needs more than is included as there is a single slot for one right next to the sim card in the pop out drawer,This one worked perfectly moving the Sim Card from a T Moble account phone and because the PRIOR phone was a BASIC phone...the numbers/contacts did NOT move over or download by themselves as they WILL if you are moving from a smart phone. I had to first EXPORT the contacts to the BASIC phone SIM card before moving the card to the new Moto Pur. Lots of easy videos on this 2 minute job on line.Once I did that...all was well after allowing some time to load up, We got a nice leatherette billfold type case for this and we have a happy family member. I really don't think there is a better smart phone in this price range and the camera is WAY better than you might think...I think they measure the single lens rather than adding up all separate lenses...NOT the STATE of the ART camera in a $1k phone but Really nice quality at 1/10th the price!

This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused).I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences):1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this.2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with).3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed).4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine.5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired.6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app).7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it.I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review.OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come! A great buy overall!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Terra sillings', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Better than I thought', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I was very nervous about ordering a phone from Amazon.

I wasn\'t able to send or receive calls or do anything that required internet unless I was connected to wifi. Including google maps when I was trying to navigate somewhere. I tried troubleshooting a bunch of different ways including removing my SIM card and putting it back in, and I spent over an hour on the phone with AT&T who told me to clear my cache in my internet browser which seemed to work for about an hour then it would tell me ""No network coverage available"" anytime I tried to do anything. It wasn\'t my carriers issue because everyone else on my plan had zero coverage issues. I went back and read more of the negative reviews on here and realized I wasn\'t alone with this issue. Like I said, I\'d never had any problems like this before with buying refurbished phones on Amazon. I don\'t know if this seller is bad, or the device itself just had some computing issues.When I requested an exchange for my phone I was told that they didn\'t have any more available and that I would have to receive a refund only available on the card that I used to purchase it. I ended up just going to AT&T and buying the new Galaxy S24 Ultra and I LOVE it.

I recommend this phone to anyone who loves android and clean software. I am a student on a budget and this phone surpassed my expectations. My only gripe is the software can (rarely) be a little buggy but that\'s few and far in between. I plan to have this phone for years. Works great with Visible by Verizon.Pros:•Great value for the price!•Amazing battery life•Extremely fast charging•Accurate and fast fingerprint sensor•Great speakers•Amazing screen•Great cameras (not as good as some other flagships, but definitely good)•Fast (the Gen 2 Snapdragon is almost too overpowered and efficient, great for emulation like PS2, 3DS, Switch)•Stays cool (has a dedicated cooling system)•Clean software•Fast Bluetooth connectivity•NFC•8GB RAM + more from system storage if needed•Premium build quality•2 year limited warranty with optional extended warrantiesCons:•Only 3 years of android updates, 4 years of security updates (compared to Apple and Samsung, it\'s on the shorter side)•Sometimes a lil buggy (not often, but worth mentioning)•Face Unlock doesn\'t work well (I don\'t use it anyways)•128GB storage gets taken up by system storage and ""other"" files\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'GuessMe', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Performance and Value – 5 Stars!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The OnePlus 12R is an outstanding smartphone that delivers on all fronts.

Then you can go back and ""enable"" the Google app again.If the Google page then comes back, as it did on my phone, repeat that process but then go back into Settings, go to ""Home Screen and Lock Screen"", then select "" Lock Home Screen layout"". That prevents any changes to the home screen and should get rid of the Google page for good.But that\'s the only thing about this phone I\'ve disliked.

First week with it, the only thing I can stress is remember the R when purchasing accessories.  I don't recall if I picked the case due to it being suggested or if I found a case separately.  What I can say is the case I have doesn't cover the cameras as well as it would, and the power button doesn't sit well in the fitting on the case.  I reviewed my orders and saw the case was for a OnePlus 12 and not a OnePlus 12R.  That being said, it was probably my fault and I ordered a new 12R case and will eat the loss on the first case.  Not a big deal.  Battery drains significantly faster than my previous phone, but it was a powerhouse (Ulefone Power Armor 18T), so my basis for comparison is quite a bit larger/longer lasting.

I taught myself a lesson: don\'t take minimal passes as success. The first observations are still valid,  but sobered by experience. Getting to know this item I found it to be, in a word, CRAP for daily use. Oh let me count the ways. 1)Touch screen is irratic. It either doesn\'t react to a tap or goes off on its own if just brushed. No change no matter what I do in settings, so it\'s useless for browsing. 2) Phone drags to connect to Internet, change pages, etc. Maddening to try to read news or an article. NOT just ""relatively"" slow. 3) Battery life is a joke!! While it charges well and holds charge if left alone, JUST DON\'T USE IT! In even browsing it east charge. Will go from 100 to 80% in less than an hour. And once it gets down to 40% you\'re toast. Not what I need for even ""go phone"" use. I\'m keeping it as an in the drawer, purely last resort bandaid in case disaster strikes with everything else. Have a different small phone coming that will go through a full check list and stay if it really passes. If not it goes back - don\'t need another drawer phone.First review below:Okay, it\'s a model a few years old, still runs android 10, lacks built-in widgets, and is relatively slow. BUT, it\'s exactly what I needed as a second ""go phone"" rather than my main line. AND it is an unlocked smart phone that really is unlocked and accommodates a reseller network (Consumer Cellular). Setup was a snap: inserted my new SIM and logged in with my Google account. The phone and Consumer Cellular did the rest including importing my contacts. I just had to disable a few pre-installed, and a couple of must haves out of Google Play, and done. As George Carlin would say, a smaller portable place for my stuff. If you\'re looking for frills, not your phone. But it\'s great for basic utility.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'desconsolada', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Esta marca me gusta porque a pesar de ser modelo económico sus fotos tienen prestigio de tener buena calidad.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Celular barato pero malo a los 20 días ya no carga la batería se calienta bastante al utilizarlo por ese precio hay mejores.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on March 24, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Celular barato pero malo a los 20 días de la compra ya no carga la batería se calienta bastante por ese precio hay mejores.\nRead more'}]",,B085TCRFST,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B085TCRFST,4g

I brought it to my carrier to transfer phones numbers, had some trouble setting it up at first but I figured it out on my own, which can be disheartening to some but here’s the pros and cons.Pros:-Cosmetically great | Saw no huge scratches or marks on the phone, if so, they’re probably REALLY minor.-Pre-installed screen protector | The seller I bought it from was called “GSMFORALL” it was nice of them to do it for me instead of doing myself, which I wouldn’t have minded but it was awesome of them to include that in!-Safe Packaging |  phone came in bubble rap sleeve when I opened it, can be considered standard but I liked that they included it.Battery Life | Battery works just fine, charges up to 100% easily.Cons:-Cheap charging chord | Cheap lightning charger, the box it fine but the charger head was loose 3rd day into using it, I would recommend getting an actual apple branded lighting chord or a braided one from a third party seller.-Trouble registering for iCloud Account | This only really applies if you’re a first time Apple user (Like Me) and needs to create an iCloud account, took it to my carrier to transfer numbers which they did just fine, but I had to call Apple support at home to troubleshoot the problem with a message displaying that I could not verify my phone number, had to erase my safari history. The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I’ve already owned one.

If Amazon sends you the wrong phone by mistake, expect at least two hours with support to get it resolved.It sucks to have to write a negative review about a bad experience with Amazon, but this is the world we live in. Quick summary: I purchased this iPhone 14 Pro Max from the Amazon Renewed store. What I received was this yellow iPhone XR as shown in the photo. A whole lot of suckiness; however, it assuredly gets worse.I reached out to Amazon\'s customer service because I figured it was as simple as them saying, ""Oh, whoops! We messed up! We\'ll send you a replacement and you can send us the wrong one back. Here\'s a li\'l credit for your trouble because we biffed it!"" Sike!The first rep told me he couldn\'t replace it because it was a third party item - which was wrong, as I bought it from Amazon directly as part of their Renewed store. The rep told me to just buy another one, send the old one back, and then they\'ll refund me for the purchase of the flubbed-up phone. To be clear: I had to pay, up front, another $900 for a replacement phone and wait until I returned the old phone to get a refund. To make things even stankier, the iPhone 14 Pro Max went up $84 since my purchase. When I mentioned that to the rep, he gave me one of these ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯I escalated up the chain to a supervisor, who parroted the first guy\'s response. Again, they want me to pay up front for a replacement phone plus an extra $84 for the new purchase price. The supervisor had a little more pull, so I negotiated for a credit for the price difference. This was after around an hour in their chat.Here\'s another thing that Amazon shrugged about: I have to be home to hand deliver the return to a UPS driver. I can\'t drop it off somewhere, or print my own label and take it to UPS, or put it in a UPS drop-off container. As someone who works during the day, I\'m not able to be home to do this. ""Oh, they\'ll just leave a label at your door if you\'re not there,""  the supervisor says. To recap: I cannot print my own label, but a UPS driver will come to my house and leave one for me if I\'m not there to give him the package.To recap:- I purchased an iPhone 14 Max Pro from Amazon and received the wrong phone.- Amazon would not send me a replacement, rather they asked me to re-purchase the phone at a higher price.- I had to negotiate with a supervisor in order to get a credit for the cost of the phone.- I cannot print the replacement label for the wrong phone and take it somewhere, but rather a UPS driver has to come to my house and physically take the package from me. Only then will I get a refund for the wrong phone.This was an exciting purchase turned sour. It was enough to give a normal person anxiety and to make an anxious person spiral out of control.

The camera is great, even at 8x zoom. Night photos were awful at first but by it improved greatly by increasing the aperture open time to 6s from 3s. Astrophotography is just wow. Pictures look better in the gallery than in the camera so it's post-processing more than hardware but hey, as long as I get crisp shots.Fingerprint sensor is not good. Often doesn't recognize my prints and works slower than my iPhone 6s I just switched from. Someone on reddit said to register the same finger twice but it didn't help much.I was concerned about the battery because the one on my 6s was awful and I didn't want to care about conserving battery on a regular day ever again. This phone has performed beyond expectations in that. Gets me 24 hrs from 80% - 20% with regular use and 36 hrs for the same drop on light days. Let's see if this battery quality stays the same with time.I didn't notice any heating except for the first time I charged it when both the phone and the adapter got considerably warm. Never lagged, performance is snappy but I don't qualify as a heavy user with games or anything.PLEASE bring back the 3.5 mm audio jack. I like wired earphones but now the charger and earphones have to share the same USB-C port and I also need to buy new earphones.Also there's no option to change the system font which is a bummer because I wanted nastaleeq script for displaying Kashmiri language.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Micah C.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on July 13, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The camera is great, the hardware seems really fast to use with no lag but I was trying to store it in the box that it came with and I thought its on a hinge I can easily open the box and use the phone but no it falls 2 inches off of a small box that I had and it looked like it made a pinsize scuff on the silver plastic around the phone and thats really not what I was expecting for the quality of the materials because it fell on wood with paint, it wasn't metal or tile or anything like that what, should I of bought a case protector for the phone? no this phone is going to get damaged as its used, the monitor I use got scratched because something fell on it, my desk is scratched, this doesn't say its cheap enough to get damaged, please pay less to get photos this high quality if thats a problem for you or buy a case protector which is a good idea but thats after its terrible.  These are so expensive but there treated like scratch technology.  After using it for a couple days I can say the camera is great but I did think it needed a better face for the video capture but thats one of the small things you notice about cameras, they may look better in person than the camera for video capture meaning that you need a really attractive face or its a character and what features do you like about the character and what you don't, its one of things about the technology that I really found to be one of the potential problems because real life interactions are usually better but for photos I was thinking these are better than video capture.After really looking at the image quality I think its lacking in comparison to an IMAX for daytime photos and the video capture in 4K didn't quite meet my expectations for film, I wouldn't be using this for filming Planet Earth, a huge amount of data in the imagery that was non existent, not as good as the photographs at 8.3MP at 4K.  These are great for using if you don't have an expensive camera but don't expect it be a replacement for the film industry.  Comparing the video quality to someone elses it did look like mine was out of focus, it does seem to be how I was panning the camera that it was going out of focus or something, the quality didn't really look worse but there was some motion blur.Really looking at the image quality for distance photos I needed better quality images, im feeling like I needed a better camera and when compared to a less expensive smartphone these are great images but thats only this much better for distance photos and yhea there better selfie images of faces but its also a different style of quality, the faces look different, they look like completely different people being photographed and that means you might like how the person looks with a different phone because of the difference.After using the phone for enough time to determine if I needed a case protector, ive decided it almost feels like if I was using it alot and not being as careful id definitely need to get one but so far it doesn't seem like im going to drop this phone, Ive not used it enough in a way id need case protector but im sort of feeling like id need one, im using the box it came with and that seems sufficient for storing it but it could use a case protector or something else to store it in but it seems like an extra cost until its used in a way that it would feel like it needed one for sure but im not using it quite like that so im ok for now but it does feel that way.  I don't wanna replace it or if there was enough damage that it didn't work id need it, im already feeling like its not for any fast movements, I can probably use it without mostly but as soon as I start using it in a certain setting I need a case protector, like im already feeling like I want to buy one just so its there to use if I needed one.I found where the camera is lacking for photos and that is anything to do with distance and leafs or bright sunlight shining at the camera somewhat as in it didn't look better than a smartphone less than half the price but for most photos it does work and it doesn't have any effect of something being tall.  The quality of the images does still need to be better for a photographer, id consider upgrading to a better camera at this part of my experience with the phone but it does show enough detail to be impressed with the level of detail.After quite of bit use with this camera im really looking for a higher quality image, im quite satisfied with the closeup photos and the distance are quite good to but if you looked at the photographs from the most expensive cameras you would be looking for better image quality.  It really struggles to look the same as the eyesight.  I realized what it was that wasn't quite there after really examining the photo quality is that you need to take professional photos with a PhaseOne or something similar to it, the Huawei smartphone cameras take great photos and so do the Pixel phones but the file size is completely different, these are fantastic images with the smartphones but your comparing them now.What I found somewhat of a complication with previewing the larger non smartphone cameras is that theres alot of settings and options on them that you may not understand at first making smartphones the easiest decision for actually taking photos but the need to see the the highest quality image is there in my mind.I am finding that if you want to zoom in after you take a photo it is to blurry and that is even from two feet away so it seems to be that there is interest in taking higher quality photos than this.  I was looking at it like it was important for that to be better or you'd need to take a macro photo.Looking at it from the perspective of thickness in the image of the detail, I can't feel these enough even though the image quality is really good, there not 3d, its a very flat image and you'll notice that with the really high mega pixel cameras it has the right amount of detail and this was enough but it also needed additional detail, its reaching the distance but its not quite there yet.Im just looking at these photos and thinking I really don't like that the clarity that you'd see with the eyesight or a really expensive camera isn't there and though I can zoom in and it looks better, I can zoom in and it looks better but 94% zoom im thinking these should be clearer, 146% zoom the background looks like a painting, 200%+ zoom these are not clear enough at all.  Id really think that close up photos are good but theres still a level of not being able to focus the camera, it needs a stand or something.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Muhammad Omair Ali', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on June 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Nice, I like the product and working good\nRead more'}]",,B0CYQ916ZY,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CYQ916ZY,5g

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kelly Lienemann', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Value for an Unlocked iPhone XR Despite Minor Wear', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now.

As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use.

You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear.

I loved my 4a, but the battery was draining pretty fast, so decided to upgrade when a good sale came along. I was hesitant about the front facing fingerprint scanner, since my husband's been having issues with his 6A. But I assumed that Google would have made the necessary improvements to make it better. They did not. My 4a had the fingerprint scanner on the back. It worked like a dream. Every single time. I've had this 7A for about a month. Getting the scanner to recognize my fingerprint has been a struggle, the entire time. You can scan in four fingerprints. I even tried scanning in the same fingerprint in the settings in all four slots. It helped somewhat. It still fails most of the time. The face scanner works decent unless you have sunglasses on or it's dark out. Which means that a good chunk at the time I end up having to put my pin number in because I time out on the fingerprint scanner. Google either needs to fix it, or go back to the rear facing fingerprint scanner. All that said, it's a great phone otherwise.Pros:The camera is absolutely amazing!All the expected quality and perks and operations of a Google pixel.Cons:It's bigger and heavier than my 4a.The fingerprint scanner is a joke. Why even bother putting it on?Would I buy it again?

This phone is still an Android phone, but the interface is a little different. For example, the volume buttons on the right side are lower and the wake button is above them, the opposite of Samsung phones. I can't get all my favorite apps, but there are others that are just as good. The main advantage of this phone is that its screen lock is stronger, and I do not get butt dials like I was getting too frequently with my last Samsung A24. The camera is just as good and the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are also just as good, if not better. It does not have a headphone jack, but Bluetooth earbuds work well with it.

The phone was unlocked but a **NETWORK UNLOCK CODE** kept popping up when sim card was insterted. (Thats the photo in this review.) So I swore the phone wasnt unlocked. Reached out to the seller and my carrier which was walmart family mobile. I was told by my carrier i needed a new sim card. So i ordered it and when it finally arrived,  boom same error. My carrier reset the sim many times and still no luck. When i had messaged the seller they gave me a code that wasnt right and when i reached out again, still another wrong code. What the phone fails to warn you is that only after a few attempts it will lock you out completely. It will then say **MASTER KEY CODE** needed. I googled what that was and it seemed like a hopeless code to obtain. The startup on the phone says AT & T. So i took it to their store and they had said that yes the phone was unlocked!! But the network was locked to walmart family mobilewhich was my carrier . So come to find out the code i needed, the first code, the network unlock code, I needed from my carrier!  They absolutely missed it and after days of this mess and ongoing phone calls, finally the walmart family mobile agent on that day in the At&T store had told me the codes i needed from day one. Idk how they just skipped the option and blamed my sim card. The codes arent a secret and im still unsure why they didnt recommend theirs to fix it. I guess they just assumed it wasnt their codes needed. But it was!!! Unbelievable right!! So then were now stuck on master key code and no one, my carrier, nor AT&T, nor samsung can help with that. Due to the sellers wrong codes, me googling the wrong codes, and most of all my carriers support line not mentioning their codes, I was locked out and was gonna return the phone. However AT&T did show me other sim cards put into the phone by other carriers were working. It was still unlocked but just couldnt now be used on family mobile and possibly all tracphone carriers due to the master key code lock. So with that said I swapped to AT&T prepaid and got their sim card and it all worked great! It was recommended to get the sim card from the AT&T store directly because sometimes those sim kits at walmart dont always work correctly and are nonrefundable. So if this issue happens to you just be sure to ask your carrier for those network codes!! The seller now knows what to suggest if this happens to another and I'm telling you that the carrier has the codes and all will be fine. Also the seller offered me a replacement phone  and partial refund for this issue. I declined a replacement only because I couldnt send this phone back and await a new one. I was already without a phone long enough dealing with this for days. So the seller at least still gave me a partial refund and that was okay with me. So the customer service is well and fair from them!!! Also even AT&T said the phone itself was in such great shape! So far so good on the phone itself, everything is working as it should.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Auricom', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Should Have Purchased One Sooner', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024', 'Review Body': 'After nearly four years with my Samsung A10e, I decided it was time for an upgrade. My criteria were specific: I wanted a more recent, used Samsung phone that was unlocked, had ample storage, and most importantly, featured a microSD slot for my extensive music library. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G in Cloud Red ticked all these boxes and more.Transitioning from the A10e, the performance leap to the S20 FE was immediately noticeable. Everything from navigating the UI to streaming content on YouTube and multitasking feels incredibly responsive. This phone has transformed my user experience, offering a significant improvement in speed and efficiency.Despite being a renewed device, the quality of the S20 FE pleasantly surprised me. It arrived with minor marks on the sides, but these were hardly a concern given the excellent condition of the screen and the overall functionality of the phone. I\'ve always been particular about battery health, so I appreciated the ""Protect Battery"" feature, which I also used on my A10e. The battery performance has been exceptional, supporting my heavy music streaming habits without a hitch.The larger display is a game-changer. The vibrant colors and increased screen real estate enhance everything from watching videos to browsing the web. I\'ve disabled certain features to extend battery life, but this hasn\'t detracted from my overall experience with the phone.One of the reasons I opted for an unlocked phone was the flexibility it offers. While I primarily use the S20 FE for media consumption, it\'s reassuring to know it can serve as a reliable backup for calls and texts if needed. The phone\'s build quality and care in its refurbishment are evident, making it a solid investment for anyone in the market for a high-quality, used smartphone.In summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect blend of performance, quality, and value, making it an excellent choice for Samsung enthusiasts and anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience without the flagship price tag.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Sandra Sandoval', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 30, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Llevo en tiempo y forma y ridículo ja funcionado de maravilla, tenía miedo de que algo fallará pero no ha sido el caso.

I saw it was shipped on the 25th. On the 30th, I received an SMS from DHL saying they planned delivery on Oct. 3rd, but on the same day I got an email asking for copy of national ID and content description for clearing customs. I am not a Morocco residents nor citizen, so I sent my foreign passport instead. On the 3rd, Amazon tracking info said clearing custom was delayed as additional documents were needed. So I called DHL, and the rep said it would be delivered on the 4th instead. On the 4th, I saw a newly posted message about delay on Amazon tracking. I called DHL various times but couldn\'t get to anyone. I then sent an inquiry by email and get a response shortly saying it was being taking care of. Then late afternoon, I got the package.Upon arriving, the seal of the packing had an opening large enough to put in a hand but not for getting the phone out, so I didn\'t complain.Unpacked, the inner packing of the phone was in excellent condition, very much like the original packing but had no Samsung marking, rather, it had a marking of ""amazonrenewed"". There was a film covering the screen, like on a new phone. The phone appeared in excellent condition, only had a small scratch at the back when I looked in detail, and a hair of scratch on the screen that is only visible under bright light and in a particular angle. I tried but couldn\'t turn on the phone - there was no response. The box also included a USB-C cable and a cheap non-Samsung charger made in China. I used my own Samsung Charger to charge the phone. After plugged in, it showed the battery was at 0. So I let it charge to full.After started, it turned out fully unlocked. My Morocco sim card works with 4G. The phone\'s software looked already reset, but I reset it myself anyhow. Then updated to the latest system with Android 12, and loaded many apps I need. During about the first week, the battery appeared quite poor. With medium usage it lasted about a day. I tried all necessary settings to conserve battery, but it didn\'t seem to help much. These couple days, it becomes much better, lasting about 45 hours. I read it was likely due to some AI processes either from Android 12 or Samsung doing the learning work at first.\xa0 But it\'s pretty bad the phone doesn\'t show any info.I would say I am very happy with the phone. And this is after having a terrible experience in the past with Samsung.The last Samsung phone I had was S7 Edge bought in Thailand (I am a traveler), new at a Samsung store for perhaps ~$800. I actually wanted the normal S7 (without the ""edge""), but it was out of stock then. I never liked the ""edge"", it was a silly design in my mind. The phone worked well initially, but in the coming couple of years I had a terrible experience. About 5 months later when I was in Vietnam, the screen started to show shaded bands across. As I was wondering how or if I should return to Thailand to get the phone serviced, the bands disappeared after a month. Then about another 7 months later when I was in Azerbaijan, the phone couldn\'t start after I did a system update. So I couldn\'t use the phone for a couple weeks until I reached Tbilisi in Georgia\xa0 when I had someone flashed it.\xa0 About a year later, it died on me again when I was in Morocco. I had someone re-flashed it, but it was not successful.\xa0 About 1 month later I reached the city of Fes where there is a Samsung service center.\xa0 After checking, they said there was something wrong with the motherboard. Very shocking!\xa0 I\'ve never had such problem in my life with all the phones and computers, cheap or dear, and this was a flagship!\xa0 So eventually, I sold it to a local repair shop for $200, for which they said they only needed the screen. That was end of 2017.So I never bought a Samsung again, and would definitely not buy one at the full price. I admit the S series is not worthless.\xa0 At least, I like the camera.\xa0 But I never had a chance to buy one at a largely reduced price (I won\'t buy from just any second-hand sellers).So now, the Amazon reviewed phone with some warranty got me interested. Yes, I have some risk, but to me with the past experience, the risk is not much higher than getting a new phone from Samsung, plus, I am putting in a much lower bet now.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jeff P', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Phone was is great condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Ordered this phone from Amazon around 5pm on Friday, and arrived at 8:00am the following day.

They  ended up being very very  helping in tracking down the seller as I always try to find a solution with them first before I call Amazon.  So, moving forward, basically I received what would be  at best, a fair to acceptable device . It has pits and grooves all along the bezels , a huge scratch on the back from the middle to the edge of the device. The screen was not great either , it came with a film type screen protector which I found strange as I purchase many devices and felt I should take it off to have a look and inspect. While the screen was not great it was also  not working properly via the amoled screen/digitizer recognizing fingerprints or gestures at times , maybe it was just the optical fingerprint sensor malfunctioning , actually I believe it’s digital sensor  on the s21 , regardless that’s nor here or there, the lint is , it didn’t work and was buggy  when touching all around NOT due to the OS (updated it to android 13 UI 5.1 it came on 11) (operating system ) but the hardware. Not being updates is not big deal as I prefer the option so that was done right at least.  However, I wish I had taken a picture of the back of the device as admittedly at this point I was disappointed and in the moment of “wth” moment because it took me 30 minutes to clean the device properly peel the stickers off and glue all over to truly inspect the device which I already knew it was going back as it’s not excellent and they will definitely get it back much cleaner than I received it but , again it device is beat up. They fact it wasnt even cleaned and  had sticker residue all over the the device as well or some sort of glue, was the first big indicator. They did not replaces the battery as well and it was not refurbished, I work in IT and other areas of tech like OSINT , basically hardware and software areas , not only by Amazon’s standards but in general, it’s common knowledge and states when purchasing , a “excellent “ condition device should have 90% battery health or above , this device had 74% battery health below 80% is unacceptable even for the cheapest condition you can buy as you’ll need a battery replacement within the 1st 6 months most likely sooner .  It gets worse as I contacted chubbiestech and got zero help or care for that matter ,  they said call Amazon it’s on them for the most part. I am making that short as ot was jet her a automated reply or a very I dont care approach on customer service.  I also reached out a second time to make them aware that about the battery percent being at 74% for the next person as a professional courtesy to get a  copy and pasted same response. So , very contradictory when if it’s sold by then and refurbed by them but are telling me it was handled by Amazon. I have the screenshots of the lack of concern or help and it’s just disappointing. As of now as I feel this brings up a issue that is indicative of the way things are now which is , the whole situation is a mess, as I made the return properly , bought insurance and did things accordingly , SO come to find out as of today the 18th of November, UPS has lost the package , Amazon can’t process my refund manually for another 2 weeks until the ticket expires , which is outrageous as this should not  be on me , my responsibility is done in the matter,  it’s was returned and I paid extra for insurance to make sure it’s safe, and I am eating the cost due to bad business practices on chubbieatech part as I am a small business myself, and I hate to say this but time is money , this will cost me in the end regardless of what happens , all due to not getting what I paid for from the start , I am in shock that in this day & age finding proper solutions and proper business practices has become so hard. If I would have gotten the excellent condition device that I had no problem paying for and they had no problem taking the money , I shouldn’t be without a device and up the creek as no one wants to step in and take accountability. I’m sorry , sellers like this that slip through the cracks and shouldn’t be in the platform, Amazon is not eBay. Now it’s my headache and it is very frustrating. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay clear from this one because if your device is not  not up to par, good luck as you will not get help , I’m a week in and I’m out of money spent and a device . I should also mention the charging port had a lip around the oval port indicating it’s been dropped , which is fine however replace the parts and check the device , make sure it works and indeed in excellent REFURBISHED condition. Nothing on this device was cleaned or fixed and was a poor device . I truly hope Amazon doesn’t sensor my review , which I have a feeling they will because this is the real life experiences that occur when you don’t get what you pay for and trust the Amazon name and sellers under them , and here I am with no device or refund of my money. It’s not ok , there is no A-Z guarantee here . Everyone has passed the buck. This is a HONEST review along with the consequences of poor business practices I think people should know about if you chose to buy from here and should not be censored.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'AmazonCustomer2013', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very good, but not excellent condition', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone came nicely packaged in an Amazon renewed box with a usb C cable, non OEM charger and sim removal tool.

YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!- materials make it feel premium! Samsung put a lot of effort into perfecting the foldable feeeling of quality. I also own an S24 ultra and they feel almost identical in terms of trust I have in the physical design and materials. Extremely well machined!- using the outside screen doesn't feel terrible and cramped as I had expected. It's a lot like when I got my flip and thought it was weirdly tall, but I got used to it.- ecosystem integration is finally to a point I can recommend people get everything Samsung, like the watch, ring, and tablets! Copy and paste works, if I need to open a message on my phone from my watch, I can immediately just open my phone, copy an OTP, etc.Ehhh:- Battery life is middling, it will last you all day, BUT with low-medium use. I am in a job where I use it around 4 hours a day and it struggles to be at even 20% at the end of my day.- Samsung bloatware is Mostly removable, I miss my pixel phones with completely uninstallable to no bloatware. I hate that we have non-uninstallabke bloatware like AR camera or Bixby (Google assistant FTW)Cons:- app support is getting closer to being more widespread but still not where it needs to be, some apps have issues with both the external and internal display ratios, whether it be too skinny to display things, or too wide to display things properly.- front/internal camera is terrible, it is taking a picture through the screen, but it is simply unacceptably bad- Brightness of the screen is not enough for outdoor use. I went to a local restaurant today and noticed I could barely see the screen with extra brightness enabled in overcast weather.Overall 8.5/10TL:DRPhysical design is impeccable, however software support and battery life hold it back from being what Samsung envisions: the perfect compact phone. 8.5/10\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Paul R Crow', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great product', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The 6th gen of the Z-Fold is a winner.

About 1 in 20 messages would show as sent but never get received by the other person. I made sure everything was updated, upgraded to Android 14, checked the APN settings a million times, but the issue persisted whether I had a weak/strong cell connection or on wifi. I switched over to RCS chats with as many people as possible, but iPhone users would occasionally miss a message from me. I finally called Boost Mobile and they said the phone is not compatible with their network. I checked the IMEI number online and it shows that it is compatible with GSM for T-Mobile networks but NOT certified for GSM with AT&T networks. ***The size is great. I have been searching long and hard for a phone that would fit in my pocket. I do not know why everyone wants a tablet-sized phone these days!Mine came with a nice thin protective case and a European charger with a Europe-US power adapter. I just tucked those away into my box of international travel stuff for future business trips since I have half a dozen USB adapters anyway.My only complaint is that this has weaker cell reception than my Moto G Play 2023. I lose signal in buildings where my Moto G Play 2023 would still be hanging on to a bar or two.I decided to disable the 5G by dialing *#*#4636#*#* and changed the preferred network to LTE/GSM/WCDMA (PRL). The mobile data had a _severe_ latency problem when connected to a _weak_ 5G signal. Instead of resorting to a 4G LTE connection, it struggled and waited to transfer data over 5G and took forever to open web pages, etc. Once I set LTE as the preferred network, everything was much faster. The mobile data was fine with a strong 5G connection outisde, but once you went in a building and had a weaker 5G signal, you could forget it. I did run an Ookla speedtest with the weak 5G and after waiting several minutes for the site to load, I got about 15MB/s. I switched to 4G and got about the same speed but didn't have to wait NEARLY as long for the website to load or for the test to start.It took a few days for me to get used to have a fingerprint scanner on the power button instead of on the M logo on the back of the phone, but it works about as well as the fingerprint scanners I've had on my other Motorola phones.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'anthony craft', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'New phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very smart.

I’m passionate about smartphones, and I’ve loved previous high end Androids. This has a few key advantages over those devices.Simplicity. I used to compile my own Gentoo. I understand the value of FOSS. Still, I’ve come to decide that a personal communicator/ data assistant needs to be usable above all else. iOS is feature-complete, thoughtfully efficient, and free of redundancy beyond Android. The toddler’s interface i used on the iPod touch has matured into what it was meant to beReliability. I’ve never had big problems with Android, but it can hiccup. On every phone I’ve used over more than a decade, I’ve occasionally experienced minor crashes, GPS gremlins, battery drains, cooling anomalies, and inscrutable major app discontinuations. In nearly a year of use, this old midrange iPhone has been utterly rock solid and i am confident Apple will not yank the rug out from under any of its core utilities. I do not manage the RAM on this phone or track battery usage. It’s just normal at all times.Durability. I do not use phone cases. The concept is a bit bizarre to me from a design standpoint. It’s not ideal, but i just try to be very careful with my phone. I’m good enough at it that, since smartphones emerged, it has been overall worth it for me despite eventually breaking two phones in that period. Still, I’m aging and I’ve dropped it. It’s clear that this phone is comprehensively designed; the materials and structure are unbelievably resistant to impact on hard surfaces. The damage to my phone is entirely cosmetic to the aluminum frame, and frankly makes me smile that it worked as intended in the face of adversity.Performance. My last phone had significantly more raw computing power than this phone. Still, this phone has a smoother UI and, in my opinion, marks a significant point of diminishing returns in mobile processing power. Clearly, little of the hardware is wasted. It is well balanced.Criticisms include: the ability to edit large blocks of text in iMessage has degraded since the last update. Moving the cursor has become more difficult. Battery life is mediocre. I can confidently get a day of normal use or a few hours of streaming video, and i have to charge it every night. My refurbished phone arrived with a gouge in the screen which i consider barely acceptable.The experience is great. I’ve lost interest in cracking software and customizing each UI element with unlimited freedom in favor of a workflow that aligns with my long-term goals. In that regard this phone excels. Lovely bit of hardware and software.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'bsan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great product.

The product that was originally sent out to me had a broken microphone for video recording. The battery health was at 81% (not terrible because Amazon guarantees a 80 or higher, so it wasn’t super bad but just wasn’t ideal).

The main complaint was that the product was faulty. So I sent it back.Secondly, the pros.MOBILESUPPLY was fast with replying, regardless of the time. They were fast and helpful with the process. A few days after I shipped the phone, they received it and shipped it to me the next day. The phone right now has a few scuffs but again, nothing too bad, you’d have to look at the phone from very specific lightings and angles to see the very SMALL and light scuffs.

Not waterproof', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Buy this yesterday already. There is a small amount of easily removable bloatware on this, but otherwise, it\'s a very affordable phone that comes with a stylus.Connectivity is very good, in the typical Lenovo/Motorola fashion. This is a great phone if gaming is not your thing and if you don\'t need quirks like foldable displays or cameras with ""Samsung 100x space zoom."" It\'s simple, reliable, and has a GREAT price.The screen is very responsive, videos work flawlessly, and the photos from the 3 cameras (1 front, 2 rear) are excellent.The mounting of the stylus (just like the 2021 and 2022 versions) leaves something to be desired, as it WILL fall out at some point. To prevent the loss of said stylus, get a GOOD case like an OtterBox or a DBrand for this phone, and order and keep spare stylus pens on you if you use them a lot (for signing documents and editing photos). I really wish that would be re-located to the top of the phone instead of being stuffed into the bottom, but for most users who don\'t use the stylus, that\'s a moot point.I\'ve had several Motorola phones since 2019 (when the LG Stylo was discontinued), and they\'ve all been good. This is yet another one I can recommend.My biggest concern is that this phone is NOT waterproof or even water resistant. My first one got fried by humidity and lake water, so I ordered a second one to replace it. Don\'t believe the marketing about ""water repellent nano coating"", get a GOOD case to protect this phone if you\'re going out on the lake or into a thunderstorm. I am NOT dinging it a star for this.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'R McL', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""They focused on what's important."", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2023', 'Review Body': 'A Good Meat and potatoes phone. Motorola has focused on the essentials of what makes a smartphone good and have saved on what makes a phone a status symbol. Very responsive interface, no lag, no hiccups, fast stable wi-fi, good battery life, solid gps for navigation, and lots of internal storage and SD card slot.They had to cut somewhere to get the phone to $300 and that is evident in the ""feel"" and materials of the phone. It doesn\'t look cheap, but the body is plastic and the back does slightly vibrate when the speakers are turned up loud. It, however, does not effect the sound quality, which is decent. The lack of gorilla glass and limited amount of updates, might limit the lifespan of this phone, but in all honesty, most phones are replaced at least within 5 years due to software and technical advancements.You will have to spend some time removing bloatware, but once you have done that you have a nice clean UI.There are quite a few options at around this price range and I had a difficult time selecting a phone. What lead me to finally selecting the Moto G 5G stylus was its support for a large number of cellular bands around the world. If you are buying an unlocked phone, you want as many options for choosing a tel carrier at home or abroad. When you look into it, it\'s a bit shocking on how limited some phones are with regard to the number of bands available. Motorola seems to be one of the best and the Moto G 5G stylus 2023, in particular.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Johnny Extreme', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Second time trying a newer Motorola Android smartphone and I am actually impressed with how well these work compared to my usual Samsung, Google, and various other company experiences.

My bf and I were very worried due to the mixed reviews. Although some of the reviews were bad I did not share the same experience.The box is secure with two white stickers on each side which is how the Google pixels are sold. When I took my phone out of the box it was in perfect mint condition and came with a USB c to USB cable. Beautiful and sexy design love the chrome detail on the camera.Charger: I did have to purchase a charging block for it. The battery was not charged so I charged it and it quickly came to 100 %. Battery lasts like a good day and a half and probably would last longer if I didn't use it so much.*** Now it did have a att card in there (like reviews stated) but I found out that an unlocked att phone that's brand new does look like that from att. ( Yes I physically called att to get to the bottom of this) The reps assured me that the seller has brand new unlocked att phones which are compatible with any carrier. Not dishonest seller like reviews had me assuming.Activation: My bf called our service provider Metro and the transfer to my phone was very fast. Took him 10 minutes and my phone was up and running. After I turned on and off my new phone like 2 times the phone was active.Functionality: I am very impressed with the speed of this phone. It's fast! If you like playing games or are like me and do everything from your phone this phone is great! Internet surfing, and multitasking is a breeze. So many free apps from note taking, games, reading, shopping, financial and more.Camera: This phone takes absolutely beautiful pictures. I even had no makeup and it looked decent not fuzzy or grainy or lack luster. When you tap the screen you can adjust contrast and brightness with out having to click edit separately. There are also really cool editing features I have not tried yet that look really cool.Still learning this  phone and the many features I haven't discovered.There are a lot of cool features like you can circle something on the screen at any time and it looks it up. Phone calls are written in words  on the screen for people who are hard of hearing during call. Very cool backgrounds during Google meet call very similar to face time features. I feel Google meet is a lot better than FaceTime (don't come for me lol). I am a previous iPhone user and there are some features of this phone that are simply better.Cost: This phone is a budget phone and still up to date with current updates and is a new phone. I refuse to spend a mortgage/rent payment on a phone. I just simply can't bc these phone prices are just insane for getting a current year phone. This one is last year's model + everything I wanted and more.Display: phone is very bright and the display is beautiful. Brightness can be adjusted bc it is a very bright phone which is great. Colors are vivid and clear making photo experience and gaming more fun.Sound: The sound is pretty loud. During calls I find myself lowering the volume. Whether you are using speaker phone or regular audio.Google users: if you do everything on Google and love the Google platform it intensifies your enjoyment. Everything transfers over and all your pictures and routine bc a breeze!I will update you all later on but at this point I couldn't say more good things ;) Just get it.** I am taking time to address all the negative feedback that almost deterred me from buying an amazing phone. I had the phone for three weeks and will be back with updates. Get yourself an OtterBox or something like it bc this phone has glass backing and if your like me than order it the same time you get the phone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tommy', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Glad I Bought It-Great Phone So Far', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I've been with Verizon for years and always bought new phones through Verizon. This is my first unlocked phone purchase. I'm on a Verizon Family Plan and the plan for all lines was upgraded to a 5G Unlimited Data plan not long after 5G went live. I stuck with my 4G-LTE Moto Z2 Play until now when I pulled the trigger on this Google Pixel 7 Pro (512GB). The phone arrived at my door delivered by Amazon Prime next day. After I first turned on and set up the new Pixel 7 Pro I turned it off then I took the SIM card out of my old beat up Verizon Moto Z2 Play and I dropped it into the SIM slot of my new Google Pixel 7 Pro phone, turned the phone back on, and voilà! The phone immediately connected to 4G-LTE initially and I got frowny face, but about 3 minutes later it automatically switched and connected to 5G with 5 bars and I got big smiley face. It's been a solid 5G connection ever since. It was just that easy-peazy for me. The phone is snappy and responsive. Phone calls are crystal clear and sound amazing. The screen resolution and picture is fantastic. Super HD quality when watching 1080P or 4K. The speakers of the phone on speaker-phone sound fantastic, and the speakers sound fantastic even when listening to music or watching a video. The volume goes up very loud and it still sounds very good with little to no volume distortion (depending on the source audio). Bluetooth devices are pairing perfectly and without issues. So far, all the features of the phone work great. Security seems tight and the facial recognition and fingerprints work flawlessly thus far. The camera takes extremely good photos and video and even in very low light they come out very good. I'm trying to think of negatives and I can't really come up with any right now—except maybe that there are a whole heckuva lot of settings of all kinds that you can adjust, which isn't really a negative at all, but it takes a long time to get it all dialed in on an unfamiliar phone. Security options are many which is a good thing. I'm very happy I pulled the trigger on this so far and I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'verified purchase' negative reviews because this Google Pixel 7 Pro rocks. I'll come back and change my rating if that changes.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Panzergreni', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent Android Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Bigger than my previous Pixel 5, better camera, no spam apps - perfect phone for me.

Turn off the haptic touch or the vibration causes two of each letter. Everything loaded on with the USBC to USBC from an old g power, in seconds without wifi. The USB 3 cable came with my SanDisk extreme 1 tig water resistant solid state drive from Costco, which pairs perfectly to these. I paid around 180 each  for the prior phones but the trackfone $45 offer is awesome. I saw it did seem to have an unlock phone option on trackfone, but for 20 a month cash for card fills from Rite Aid, and truck wifi, so it never uses gigs, I'm staying with tracfone. I was sick of Verizon Xfinity overcharges on 2 phones, and this goes nicely with the cheap pocket size flip as a second business line, to carry anywhere, but you can still sign and accept documents on this nice phone. If a document comes in on the little flip phone text, you just forward the text to this G Play and do business.  This phone does everything thing the iPhones do that I'm interested in doing with no monthly contract or overages, just $20 period, unlimited talk text and 2 gigs data for emergency if you set to wifi only, and use your home or vehicle wi-fi to stream, FB, etc. You never need to speak to customer service ever again.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'kevin', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good for the $$$', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Works , a bit laggy at times and takes forever to restart but other than that it's good for calling and texting and a few apps.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jason', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Basic is about all', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It's not a phone to play games on or expect much from.

Even the plastic bag which it came with stated so. When I powered the unit for the first time it had no problem booting to the setup screen which was in Spanish and indicated that its 5000mAh battery was 50% charged. Although it wasn\'t difficult to change the language to English, I decided to power it down and wait until it was fully charged before continuing with the setup. This took around 30 minutes to complete. I needed to completely transfer as much of my data, folder, contacts and apps from my old Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime to this Samsung Galaxy A25 5G so I used the free Samsung app from the Google Playstore to accomplish this. The transfer over wifi took a few hours and only left out 5 apps which were relatively unimportant and easilly reloaded to the new phone from the playstore.Trying to save a few bucks, I then tried to switch my sim card from the old phone to the new phone myself. I followed the online instructions provided by Metro by T-Mobile, but this is where I encountered a problem. The IMEI number was not recognized by Metro and suggested I call for assistance. I wondered if the negative comments about this phone not being truly unlocked and not working in North America were true, so I decided to stop at this point and just wait until I could visit the nearest Metro store for help.The following morning, I did so. To my surprise it only took all of under 5 minutes and at a cost of $26.78 for a new sim card plus an activation fee to have me out the door with my old phone number successfully transferred to the new phone. Since then, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G seems to be functioning just fine. I love how bright and clear the screen is. Its responsive and easy it is to use inspite of the fact that it is light years more advanced that my old one. I\'m still learning about all its innovations and how to use it properly. Imagine, within a day of receiving this new phone I went from a smartphone using Android 7.11 OS to Android 14 OS!!! Would anyone believe that had I not needed to switch to an an Android OS of 11+ just to be able to utilize my car\'s Andro Auto Infotainment System fully, I would still be using my old J7 Prime?!Though not as powerful as the latest Galaxy S or N models, its specs including it\'s screen, video and multi-camera resolutions, refresh rate, processing unit, tactile response and even its storage expandability are fairly impressive if not respectable at such an affordable prize. If down the road I find anything to dislike or complain about it, I\'ll be sure to write an addendum to this review. In a nutshell ... I can vouch that this phone works just fine with Metro by T-Mobile cellular carrier in Florida (or at least my neck of the woods, East Central Florida) and can make calls either over wifi or just using cellular data.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Katie', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'A great phone!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The phone is truly a middle range device.

I stayed on the Note 9 for many years, and finally, when my provider could no longer replace my Note 9 under extended warranty, I was forced to look at another brand.Enter the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024!  Amazon was running a promotion on this brand new release from Motorola, and at $317.95 for a brand new unlocked Moto flagship, I was absolutely down for that.  I got so used to paying $1,300 to $1,500 for the latest Samsung flagship phone release, I almost forgot what bang for the buck value looked like! :)As I walked through the Specs of this phone, I couldn\'t help but feel like, wow, I\'ve been overpaying for a large screen and stylus forever....need to try something new.  And I wasn\'t dissapointed!  I had been considering the Pixel 8 Pro for several months, but I couldn\'t get one from my mobile provider, and I couldn\'t get a good deal for an unlocked version ($799 to $999) so I started looking at Motorola.Low and behold, their latest flagship Stylus 5G (just launched in May 2024) was on Promo :)  The big draw for me with both the Pixel and the Moto Stylus was that they were Google phones...literally.  Everything about them was Google centric.  And better yet, no bloatware or stupid useless skins over the Android experience.  Just pure Google/Android and great Apps.The new phone transfer process was seamless and super easy!  I just took my Sim Card out of my old handset, and threw it into the Moto G Stylus, and immediately Google\'s phone transfer process kicked in.  Step by step, device to device, in about 45 minutes I was done.  That\'s it, easy peezy.My initial few days with the new Moto, man, a $1,000 less in cost for very good performance, 120Hz refresh rate, Google centric Android experience, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of Flash Storage, Nice Aluminum stylus, good Apps for Notes, Art/Drawing, Editing, etc.  WiFi performance is excellent, Cellular reception is much better than my previous $1,400 Note 9, Bluetooth range is excellent, Camera is solid, with Pro features and capabilities if you wanna get all high end with your cameras, camera software is way better than the 2023 version, MP is up(50), camera quality is way up (software improvements), embedded storage is more than adequate for on device storage needs (256GB\'s is a lot of local storage, when you store everything to Google Drive), and the performance of the SnapDragon SOC, while not the latest and greatest, it powers through moderate gaming, is awesome for media consumption (streaming video) UI is super fluid, no jittery transitions, swipe is butter, couldn\'t be happier with the overall performance.It comes loaded with Android 14, it has an Audio Jack port! and it supports Micro SD card storage up to 2TB (although I haven\'t physically confirmed that) and Dolby ATMOS with two very capable speakers integrated for excellent sound performance.  The 6.7"" pOLED screen is outstanding, Refresh Rate is awesome (120Hz), SnapDragon 6 SOC is solid, all that and the all day 5,000mAh battery + rapid charging (35W wired, 15W wireless)  you\'ve got as complete a package as I\'ve ever seen.In short, I\'m done paying an arm and a leg for technology I don\'t really need.  Give me rock solid value every day.  The Moto G Stylus 2024 is just that, Maximum bang for the buck on every front, and I don\'t have to take out a 24 month loan to buy it!!!  I would highly recommend trying this handset out!8/29/24 Quick update for everyone on adding MSD storage to the phone. 2TB\'s is overkill for me because I use Google Drive for backup and Amazon Photo\'s as well, so I don\'t need ton\'s of onboard storage, but for the sake of checking out the Micro SD card capability, I dropped $35 on a 1TB SanDisk High Speed MSD, dropped it in, and instantly recognized as external (not embedded) storage, and the only choice you need to make is whether you want to format it such that you can move the card to any device as external storage, or leave it as phone dedicated storage and you\'re done.  Once again, seamless experience, no hassles, no incompatibility problems, nothing.  Plug and Play.  Having used the handset now for several weeks, it\'s more awesome than I originally thought.  It just does soooo much for so little cash, I\'m giving it a 10 out of 10.  Lesson learned, don\'t be a slave to specs.  This phone is boss, hands down the best stylus enabled large handset for the buck.  I can\'t wait to see the next gen of this handset......all smiles friends :) :) :)\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mike F.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone, nice screen', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Good phone for the price.Good:Price, smooth operation, great screen, strong speaker volume, has NFC, wireless charging, moto gestures (actually pretty useful, chop-chop motion to turn on the light, and twist to turn on the camera).

It's a genetic thing and I can't do much about it. I say this, because when I realized the battery in my 2021 Moto Stylus G is not staying charged, I needed to get a replacement that preferably had a nice camera with stabilizing ability. I almost got a high-end phone, but then I realized that almost none of them has expandable memory. I am not okay with that. I did some research on the latest Moto Stylus phone and I liked what I read. Now that, I've had a few days to test it out, I like it a lot. I'll lay out a few reasons. by the way, I took the two pictures above with the Moto Stylus 2021 and Moto Stylus 2024. I'll let you guess which picture is from which.#1 Camera -- my favorite feature of this phone is the camera. I don't know if the camera has a physical or software stabilizer, or both; to me it doesn't matter, because my pictures turn out so much better!#2 Speed -- I'm used to turning on my phone and waiting a bit for it to load up after a reset. This new stylus phone loads up really quickly and I'm surprised at how quickly I can use it.#3 -- The Stylus -- The stylus has a newer design to it. To me it feels more sturdy and easier to use than my old stylus#4 -- Software -- The software seems improved overall. I am enjoying all the minor tweaks that Android has made since version 11.#5A -- Finger sensor -- I'm not a fan of the change. The finger sensor is now on the screen. I like having the sensor on the back of the device. I realize they did this, to allow for wireless charging; so most will prefer this. Also, I don't really need the finger sensor anymore, because of facial unlocking; nevertheless, I still prefer the finger sensor to be on the back of the device.#5B -- Facial sensor -- A new feature for me, this works great; I have a beard, and the phone has no problem recognizing me.#6 -- Screen -- The LED screen on the old Moto, was pretty good; however, the OLED screen on the new phone is really nice.#7 -- I reused the SD card from my old device, however, it works well and I have no lag in performance using it. I also look forward to upgrading it in the future, should I run out of room... 2 TB is an insane amount of space.Pros:Excellent cameraProcessor and ram are fastStylus feels goodSoftware has good improvements over allThe new OLED screen is a good leap forwardCan hold up to 2 TB of add on storageCon:Finger sensor now on the screen instead of the back of the device.\nRead more""}]",,B0D1ZFS9GH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D1ZFS9GH,5g

I love Android and I was really intrigued with the Google and Asus phones. I have had a galaxy since the beginning of smart phones it would seem. Well, looking at all options as well, the red iPhone caught my attention solely in color. I know IPhone is a good phone, for the most part, everyone I know seems to have iPhone or Galaxy. I have never owned an iPhone and they are much more expensive than the phones I was looking at. But the red iPhone, I just kept coming back to. I started looking into the differences, and then started looking into refurbished. I have also never purchased a refurbished phone. The price difference for a “Premium” or “excellent” condition iPhone, was significantly cheaper than buying brand new. I went back and forth on Amazon, with different sellers based on reviews, and ended up landing in the option where it is sold and shipped by Amazon themselves (which I thought was more likely to be exactly what is described in their product page). I will say the first try to purchase did not go through, so there were some issues with the monthly insurance plan for the phone. But the second time it did go through, and I was having to wait probably 4 days for it to get here. I was so excited, like a kid waiting for Christmas to get here.Finally the iPhone arrived, and in absolute perfect condition. I went with the “premium refurbished” option. The delivery was incredibly secure and the driver was extra helpful before they arrived so we could time it. I opened the box and there is not one scratch or thing that would tell you that this isn’t a brand new phone. It comes with a charger, block and the phone information on a leaflet (that would otherwise be in the original iPhone packaging). I did wait to activate it, until I had time to go into a physical carrier store, but I backed up everything before I did that in my old phone. It took maybe 5 minutes for the associate at my carrier store, to set the iPhone up and transfer everything I wanted from my galaxy and the service, to the iPhone. I was worried based on other reviews that it could possibly not be unlocked to all carriers, but it was. One of the main reasons I chose to buy the refurbished option from the sold by/ships by Amazon option, because I trusted the accuracy of the description more.ALL THAT SAID beautiful phone, looks brand new, works like it’s brand new, has 100% battery life out of the box and is very easy to get used to (even if you have had an android all your adult life). I definitely recommend this product and Amazon as the seller to ensure you get what you are looking for. I am SO happy with my purchase and when it comes time to get a new phone a few years from now, I will be starting here this time!

There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone!

I'm continually pleased more and more as I use it. Look, I don't delve deep into specs or drool over asthetics - I just want a phone that does what it's supposed to do. But it sure does look nice all the same. Add a Poetic case and it will feel solid in your hand and it will sit without wobble from the cameras. It's fast. The screen looks great. Speakers are rather loud with volume up but of course you aren't likely to play music using only the speakers, you'll stream it to some Bluetooth speakers or use ear buds. Android 14 is slick and easy to use. As always, Motorola adds only a few gesture options and a few moto specialty assists but you don't need to use them - you will, though! No added bloat, almost pure Android. The cameras are far better than the moto cams of old. I have no complaints. Charges ridiculously fast. Battery lasts 2 days or more normal use, I haven't drained it fully to see exactly how long but I'm very happy with the battery life. The power button below the volume is weird at first but it's easy to get used to. You can power off using the button on the screen near the settings icon so you rarely need the physical button anyway. You can also change the very odd default setting for power off using the power key and volume button same time, which is awkward. Just check the settings and switch it to power off with just the power button. I love a big phone so I'm happy with the size. And here's something unexpected that I really appreciate - the screen is smudge resistant and does a great job of keeping prints off it. The phone looks nice all the time, no greasy fingerprints for the most part. When you do notice it needs a wipe, a soft cloth and literally 2 seconds to get it perfect again is all you need. Any marks come right off without smudging. The haptics give a great feel as you navigate. The price is excellent for the quality of this phone. Highly recommended.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'T Dono', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'My favorite phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Phone is slim, light, and durable.

When searching for phones for my son, I was prone to break phones or submers them, this phone grabbed my attention. The gorilla Glass Victus screen with military spec drop protection as well as ip68 waterproofing is reassuring. At under $400 price is fair. The phone is not overly bulky, it performs a snappy as any other, the screen is great. Basically this is a flagship phone spec from a few years ago without the $1,000 price tag. Of course it has the Motorola customizable features beyond plane Android, added secure folders and the ability to interact with Windows base computers, particularly the ThinkPad. But even if you're not using it for these purposes, it is a great performing phone that does all the things that should do. The camera is very good, talk quality is good, the stereo speaker sound/quality is good, perhaps a bit more peak volume would be suggested in future rendition but still adequate. The biggest frustration is when searching for phones like this, Amazon does not discern and reviews what phone is being reviewed. So when you look at the amount of stars this phone has, it is not at all clear that it reflects this phone, certainly the comments do not as therefore many different models.

Its a fast 120hz display so media is quite smooth. The motorla edge plus 2023 is also lighter than i expected while still packing a punch in performance with its chipset. I can play most games on max graphics and still getting 60 frames.Charging is now not an issue whatsoever. I can plug the phone know for 20 minutes and it already gives me 50 percent.Some minor drawbacks would be the easiness to find a good case for the phone. Not many companies take in motorola phones to make cases that have a magsafe magnet.Another complaint i have with the phone is the camera quality. The photos it takes in good lighting conditions are truly impressive and almost looks like the real thing. It gives immersive and good detail at far distance objects. However, it is not all that great with photos in lower lighting conditions. Photos seem to be a little over exposed leading them to have more noise and worse color grading. Details also seem to be worse as i can't capture clouds as good during cloudy days. Things just don't look natural.That's all i have to say.

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds.

It allows my child to make and receive phone calls, as well as to do basic texts. A simple call to T-Mobile customer service on her prepaid Sim card plan allowed me to shut the data off. It does have Wi-Fi so if your goal is to eliminate social media, you’re going to have to block this device on your router. I have Comcast and it allows me to Restrict Wi-Fi access based upon each device attached to the network. Don’t underestimate your child’s ability to find other Wi-Fi sources, but the operating system on this phone render it relatively useless. The phone can still access the Internet through an installed browser in the operating system, but it’s fairly rudimentary and , I suspect that it in effect eliminates the desire for social media since it’s so difficult to type out a sentence on a numeric keypad. So my recommendation is 1) buy this flip phone 2) get a T-Mobile, prepaid Sim card and pair it to your child’s cell phone number after you’ve ported the number to T-Mobile 3) select the $10 a month prepaid plan 4) call T-Mobile customer service and ask them to shut off the data on that phone number. They will give you our time and tell you that that isn’t an option, but it is an option and you just need to continue to insist on it and speak to a supervisor if they aren’t willing or able to do what you’re asking.  5) finally, block, access to Wi-Fi on your router for this device.

KaiOS is a stripped down version of Android running on a little processor that isn\'t capable of keeping up with the demands of Android bloat.  For example, open the phone, and in big numerals it will show you the time _that you last opened the phone_.  It may take up to a minute to update and show the actual time.  (You can train yourself you read the actual time on the tiny status bar.)  Sending a text message?  Type slowly because it won\'t keep up.(And good luck finding basic punctuation marks like the apostrophe or capitalizing a name in the middle of a sentence.  And your preferences for which text typing mode you like are constantly being reset to bad defaults.)The UI is unnecessarily cumbersome.  If you receive a spam text (aren\'t they all?), you\'re going to have to press a lot of buttons several times to delete it.I don\'t have a data plan because all I need is the occasional call and even rarer SMS message.  But if this phone ever gets access to data for even a moment, it starts trying to update.  And when that data is interrupted, your notifications will be spammed with a slew of error messages.  And, sometimes, that leaves key apps, like your contact list, inaccessible.The beauty of Type C USB connectors is that you can insert them either way.  However, if your charger and cable support PD (Power Delivery) and/or QC (Quick Charge), the phone will charge only when the cable is plugged in the ""right"" way.  If you leave it overnight on a charger with the cable the wrong way around, you\'ll wake up to a dead battery.  From what I\'ve read, you have to go out of your way to design a Type C USB port that isn\'t symmetric.  But why would you do that?  (And the battery life is terrible compared to previous feature phones I\'ve had.  Putting Android under the hood may have been an expedient way to create KaiOS, but you can\'t throw that at a low power processor and expect it not to burn through the battery.)Oh, I almost forgot about Bluetooth.  This phone fails to pair with my car.  My car thinks the pairing is successful, but the phone does not.  This phone does pair with my wife\'s car, but not mine.  Every other phone I\'ve used was able to pair with both cars.I don\'t have a great need for a cell phone (coverage at home is spotty at best), so I haven\'t gone looking for an alternative.  Yesterday, however, the phone died, a just few days short of 10 months of very light usage.  Outer screen won\'t light up.  Inner screen is filled with random pixel values.  If I call it, it doesn\'t even ring, so it\'s not _just_ a display failure.This device doesn\'t reach even the most minimal requirements of a cell phone.  If Nokia still cared one iota about its brand name, it never would have authorized this disaster.  It\'s actually worse that the Kazuna eTalk, which I wouldn\'t have imagined was possible.  This is not fit to be called a phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Flip phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Purchased as a gift.

I'm talking about quality wise. The old ones I had were built like tanks but it seems like none of the companies want to sink that effort into the new ones. I guess this one is close.It runs on KaiOS so you do get a few more app type options which I really didn't care about. If I still wanted apps, I would've stuck with my smart phone. Apps on this thing are just mobile Firefox web pages and they're flaky, don't work well with scrolling or clicking so don't expect much.Even email isn't going to impress anybody on KaiOS. You might as well only set up one account cause that's all you can use at one time anyway. If you want notifications from a different email account, you have to physically switch over to that account. Luckily, again, I wasn't looking for email features.Texting is the painful T-9 again which, due to the addition of all phones using the number 1 for voicemail, throws all the letters off by one, so any old muscle memory training you had from years ago is going to get screwed up. You have to retrain yourself on T-9 again. Fortunately, this phone has nice big keys so it has been easier than a couple of other flip phones I've tried. BUT, the biggest bonus with this phone as for texting has to be the voice input, which is actually fairly decent. I was impressed with how accurate and easy, easier than using the T-9 input, to enter quick texts. I'd recommend trying and using that feature as it will save you lots of grief trying to type.Ultimately, it's still a quality thing for me and this phone doesn't quite meet the same standards as my old flip phones. It's noticeably very plastic and also quite slippery in the hand. I'd strongly recommend getting the textured form fitting case at the same time or chances are good the thing is going to slide out of your hand.The battery length is probably it's best feature as it lasts a good 2-3 days depending on use. I never have to worry about charging it in the car as I can throw it on the charger at home for an hour or two and it's full again and ready for another couple of days.The blue color I ordered does not look like the pictures at all. It's more of a turquoise blue-green which I can't stand. I would've ordered the red had I known but I don't know if that would've looked like the pics or been more orange-red so unless you can physically see one, it's a gamble. Thankfully I ordered the textured case in black so it pretty much covers all of the ugly color of the phone anyway.I had been using the Nokia 8810 banana phone prior to this one and thankfully, the 2760 has far more processing power so you can actually do stuff without totally bogging the thing down like I found on the 8810.There is some bugs with the use of an sd card as well. I got mine all ready from my computer, and while the phone can see it and browse the files, it can't find any music files so I also can't change any ring tones. People on forums have said they have had some luck formatting the card on the phone itself but still run into problems when they try to hook the card back up to their PC to add music, etc. as the computer wants to reformat it again so it's a viscous circle. I didn't care enough about ring tones and music to bother fighting with this so I just left it as is for now.Overall, if you are looking for a modern flip phone that is somewhat close to old school quality and don't care about apps or anything other than having something for making calls and short texts, this is about the best I've found for a reasonable price. If Nokia, or some company, would offer a updated version of almost any old flip phone as far as build quality, I really think they would have a good size market of users who are wanting to get rid of a lot of their tech and go old school like me.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Néstor', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on February 1, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Mi papá está contento\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Aldo Manuel', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on January 31, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Falló a las tres semanas.Buena calidad en las llamadas, buena calidad de construcción, pero no tanto en los materiales.

Better than expected.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've been using the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2022) for about a year now, and overall, it’s a solid phone, especially for the $140 price point. I see that they have increased the price now. It’s not flashy by any means, but for everyday use, it gets the job done.The battery life is the best I've got to say. It's the main reason I bought it. The 2-day battery holds up, and I don't often find myself connecting it to a charger. Even with moderate usage, like whether you are scrolling, texting, or doing some light gaming, it lasts the entire day and beyond.\xa0The 50MP camera is decent. In good lighting, photos come out satisfactory, but it struggles a bit in low light. I personally edit the photos later using the adjusting tool in the camera app; it makes it reasonably sharp and clear. The camera app is easy to use.\xa0The stylus is also a cool feature that I didn’t think I’d use much, but it’s actually handy for quick notes and drawing.Let's talk performance. It’s good for the price. It handles most tasks without too much lag. There are occasional slowdowns when switching between apps simultaneously when you are on a call; it becomes annoying, but it's not much of a deal breaker.The phone’s build is nice and big, and the color looks great. It feels comfortable in the hand, although it's a bit on the larger and heavier side. It becomes a little tricky when I don't have pants with bigger pockets. So keep that in mind if you prefer more compact phones.Overall, if you’re looking for a budget friendly phone that has reasonable performance, a good battery, and a few extra features like the stylus, the Moto G Stylus is a good choice. For $140, it’s hard to beat in this segment, but don’t expect it to perform like a high end phone. It’s good value for what you pay!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'VinnyD', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I  always use a motorola phone.

Battery lasted well, speaker and camera were decent, and had some nice software features.The phone was great, for the first month, until I started to notice particular issues with it. It doesn\'t maintain a WiFi connection. It\'ll say that it\'s connected, but then pages won\'t load and it\'ll endlessly be buffering until I turned the WiFi off and suddenly it was a fast as lightning. I own numerous devices that connected to the same WiFi with absolutely no issues, and I even tried using different WiFi hotspots, but always had the same issue. I even tried configuring the phone settings to see if that would help, but it never did.What really bothered me about this phone though, was the fact that after a certain period of time after it was on (I\'m not sure exactly how long, but definitely less than 24 hours) suddenly the actual PHONE part of this ""smartphone"" would stop working. It would still be able to use data, and I was able to send /receive messages via social media, but I wouldn\'t be able to make/receive phone calls or texts. I\'d suddenly get a voicemail, while using my phone, stating that I missed a call when it didn\'t ring. And if I tried to make a call, the call would immediately end without ringing. The only way I figured out to resolve this (even after searching Google for more ways to configure the settings), was to restart the phone.Which brings me to my third issue. A small percentage of the time, it would restart in a normal, timely manner (1-2 minutes), but most of the time it would freeze on the startup screen for at least 5 minutes before finally loading in. Sometimes, if I held the power button and manually turned it off and back on, it would fix it, but not usually.My fourth issue, was that sometimes if I plugged it into the charger, it would suddenly restart. It didn\'t seem like too much of a big deal at the time, until one of the times that it happened, it froze ENTIRELY on the startup screen. I tried doing what I did previously to hopefully get it to start again, but it continued to freeze. After searching online for answers and trying to troubleshoot it, the only answer I was able to find... Was to manually factory reset it. I would have considered bringing it it somewhere to be looked at by a professional, but I didn\'t have the time or the money for that, especially since I was not at home and needed the phone ASAP. Doing this was an absolute last resort for me and I was devastated.Finally, what brought about the death of this phone, was that it\'s definitely not waterproof. I\'ll admit that this was entirely my fault, but I\'d like to mention this as a warning to those who are used to nearly indestructible water resistant phones (like the Samsung Galaxy series). It happened to be on the sink counter beside me while I was brushing my teeth and I accidentally knocked it into the water stream. The charging port ended up frying and it no longer charges. Being that I had so many issues with it though, I\'m thankful to have a reason to move on.Also, I\'d like to mention that if you\'re used to responsive pressure sensitive styluses (like the Galaxy Note series), the stylus for this phone is nothing like that. It\'s exactly like a stylus you\'d buy from the dollar store, except it looks nice and fits inside the phone.Another thing I\'d like to note, is that this phone is very heavy compared to other phones and kind of bulky. I like to use PopSockets, and I never had issues with them before, but while using this phone I had to replace the base about once a month because it would just start peeling off, due to the weight. I ended up having to super glue it to my phone case, which resolved the issue. It also hurt my hand quite a bit while holding it for any length of time.Despite all of these things, it did have numerous features that I liked, but they were software related, so I imagine they would probably be available on most Motorola phones. The battery also lasted a decent amount of time as well, about a day and a half as long as I didn\'t do too much gaming. The speaker was also nice and loud, but a little tinny at times. The camera was decent too, and I was able to take some nice pictures with it.The cons definitely outweigh any positives in my opinion. What the point of a smart phone if it doesn\'t perform as a phone?\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazing and really effective for detox!

I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Emmanuel', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing Camera and great overall phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I've been waiting to get the 12 for a while now coming from a 9 PRO.

It came with its own apps. Phone, messages, calendar, email, etc... This phone comes with all Google Apps. Including the keyboard. Apparently OnePlus has given up on actually building solid apps and are just slapping Google apps into it. Had I known this I would have probably gotten a Google Pixel or Samsung phone.The allure of OnePlus was that I was freeing myself from these corporate eco-systems that harvest my data and provide no privacy. Well not anymore. With the OnePlus 12 you get the Google Phone app, Google Messenger, Google Calendar, Gmail (so none of my private email accounts I use on my own domains can be added without routing all my email through Google servers to be scanned). At least OnePlus gave me a Notes app! You can disable these apps in the app manager but you can\'t uninstall them.If I don\'t want my text messages scanned and synced with Google I could download a 3rd party texting app, same for all the other system apps. But there\'s two problems. First is that other apps are way less trustworthy, and secondly they often cost additional money to buy. And who knows when and how they might get ""updated"" over time.What really drives me crazy is that this phone uses Gboard, Googles keyboard. I have no idea what Google is collecting from everything I type. I really wanted a free from big tech phone. I thought OnePlus was different. This is a sad day.Other than this being a Google-everything phone, it\'s pretty good. The hardware is solid but the software could use some polishing. The camera is good but the built in editing software is horrendous. The camera doesn\'t shoot using the full amount of megapixels unless you switch it to a special mode, and then it can only shoot in RAW or JPEG... Not HEIF for some reason. Weird. Since HEIF supports 10bit and 4:2:2 color and smaller file sizes. Nope. If you want to use the full 50MP it\'s either massive RAW file or JPEG.The screen edges are curved. Makes it feel like a phone from 10 years ago. But the screen is bright and beautiful.By default the screen resolution is lowered, I left it that way because I can\'t see the difference. The power mode is lowered, again, left it that way because its so fast and snappy I can\'t imagine wanting more. The battery life is AMAZING... At the lowered resolution and power mode.I use Nova Launcher because I cannot stand the Google Discovery thing being baked into this phone. If you swipe all the way to the left it pulls up Google Discovery. And you can\'t turn it off. I hate Google and want nothing to do with their stuff. This phone really forces everything Google on you.Do I like the phone? Yes. Do I love it? No. I hope OnePlus goes back to building their own apps and not just cramming Googles into it. If in wanted Google I\'d buy Google Pixel.The slogan of the OnePlus company is ""never settle."" Well, not only did they settle, they seem to have given up. And I can\'t settle on this phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'jeff Euronadian', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 26, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I get a lot of research on this phone before purchasing it.

Was interested to see that this had both, as well as a stylus.Got it for $250 on Prime Day and my biggest fear going from a Snapdragon 8 gen 1 to a 6 gen 1 was performance. I've been more than pleasantly surprised. In fact, when using Spotify and other apps that require a fast scan down the page I've actually found it faster. Was also happy to see just how sharp the red version looks. I put it under a clear case and love the way it looks.The camera app is certainly a weak point as it really does give extra color to images, and can take a split second longer to take a photo than a premium S22/iPhone, but its fine for my limited use.The battery has been the star of the show. Minus the relatively slow charge vs OnePlus's 60W charging, it's been amazing. Getting two days of battery life has been insanely refreshing.In second place for my favorite design angles, only by tiny bit, is the screen, which seemed to have a better white balance than the OnePlus 10 Pro. It's beautiful. It's also been very crisp and responsive, with the touchscreen always hitting the exact spot I touch (an issue I had on the OnePlus).Overall, for $250 (!) or even $400, this is a tremendous value. I don't game or do much video processing, so I can't speak to that...but for me, minus the camera speed, this daily drives very close to the flagship phones of my past. Add to that an audio Aux jack and the ability to add additional SD storage and it's a no brainier for most non power users (IMO). If you're not a power user and are looking to save cash on a solid phone, I'd say go for it. So far (2 weeks in), I couldn't be happier with my choice.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Paulian Moscovici', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Reliable and user friendly', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent phone for everyday usage.

Requires a good manual, though.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Just got this phone on 9/22/2024. Still checking it out.The first thing I noticed is that this phone came with very little instruction, which was a disappointment. However, I found an online manual on the Motorola website and I accidentally found another manual in PDF format on the Internet with the name ""moto g stylus 5G.NA Retail.UG.en-US.SSC8D23433-A.pdf.""You can do a Google search and download this manual for yourself. After doing a search for the PDF file mentioned above, you will find a listing named ""moto g stylus 5G User Guide"". That\'s it. You should study this manual and also understand that there are some differences between the information in the manual and the features of the phone. But the manual should help a lot.I experimented with photos because part of the reason I bought the phone is to take an important photo or do an important video if the need arose. I haven\'t spent much time on this yet, but I can tell you that I\'m somewhat disappointed, but not surprised, with the quality of photos. I just did some videos and I\'m still working on that, but videos can be done fairly well.You can plug this phone into your computer using a USB cable. It comes with a charging cable that has a C-size USB connection on both ends. This can be used with a USB wall charger, but they don\'t give you a USB cable for connecting to your computer, but I already had a USB cable for that.When you plug in your USB cable to connect to your computer, you will be asked what kind of USB connection you want. I choose ""Photo and Video Transfer"". Then you can use your phone like a disk drive. However, you should not try to play your videos directly from your phone. I suggest that you copy all the videos to a good fast drive on your computer and play them from there. I also advise that you should really use 60 frames per second for a smoother video.From what I can tell, a phone like this isn\'t really going to take the place of a good digital camera or a good camcorder, so don\'t expect to do that. But it does a fairly good job.The overall physical quality seems very good. The display is very sharp. The stylus works well and I use it most of the time because I have large fingers. Using a finger print as a security means works very well.The overall design of the software seems pretty good, but I urge you to download a manual for this phone because the overall complexity of the operating system.While charging the phone from my computer, I get a ""slow charge"" message. However, the phone will still charge from my computer. From a USB wall charger, I don\'t remember getting any slow charge message. You might consider that slow charging increases the life of most batteries, so maybe it\'s a good idea to charge from a computer, after all.I\'ll update this review after finding out more about this phone, if I remember to do so.9/24/2024: Had a chance to test photos and videos. I think the quality of both is surprisingly good. I\'muploading a test photo that I think turned out very good. View this first with a viewer that fits the file to your screen. Then zoom in to 100%. The picture is perfect both ways. Notice how the dust shows up between the keys on my keyboard.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'NG.', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Not impressed..battery life is worse that my old moto e5 plus!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024', 'Review Body': ""How can a new phone have battery life worse than an old phone!!(went from 68% to 58% just on a whatsapp video chat!!)why is that even a thing!why is that allowed!new tech should be better not worse!!weird lag when using the video or photo app....horrible bottom facing speaker that you can feel vibrating when you're talking to someone..screen is really bad in sunlight too,think im done with Motorola after this one..not a happy customer.\nRead more""}]",14.536340852130325,B0D5PFR7DK,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D5PFR7DK,5g

If you 'live' on your phone you can find one that will better suit your needs, but for a casual phone user like myself (mostly talk, text, web surfing, etc.) this was a great little upgraded phone for me.Set up was super simple.  Pop your SIM card out of your old phone, and reinsert it into the new one.  Make sure both phones are connected to the same wifi, as the new phone will automatically ask you to transfer data from your old phone to new.  This process was fairly quick and really hands-free.  Be sure to back up your contact list to your SIM card in your old phone before doing this, as it will save you the hassle of figuring out who's who if some of the newer contacts haven't been saved to SIM.  Otherwise, the setup of this phone is really quite painless.I'd recommend this phone to anyone who is a causal user and not looking for a powerhouse phone.

No trash bloat apps from carriers and my recommendation is to go into app info of all the apps you don't use and hit disable on them and enable remove animations in accessibility settings to make the phone feel super quick. It's a generally good phone and I just needed something smaller and after my previous phone was too big in my pocket. I don't game on my phone but I wouldn't expect 60fps from newer games on this. I use the headphone jack daily and there's no hissing or unwanted noise from the internal dac so it's good enough for Spotify or your mp3s. Fingerprint is fast and my only gripe is I hated the stock launcher it came with so I just use the Microsoft launcher from the play store. It's a phone and if youre just some guy or gal that needs something reliable Id say this is a good place to start.

Ever.  Never will.  I like flagship phones though, and will buy a new-old-stock, or pristine used, 2 year old flagship model.  This seemed to work for me quite well.  I still have an iPhone 8 Plus that is awesome.  Also part of the equation is security updates.  Frequent, regular, like clockwork, security updates.With iPhone this is standard.  With android phone makers, it\'s hit and miss, mostly miss.  Samsung does update their flagship frequently... for a time.  But Samsung wants $1200 for their flagship.  No thanks.Pixel?  I heard Google provides regular, systematic updates.  Their phones don\'t cost $1000.  Saw some good things said about the Pixel, thought I\'d try the Pixel 4a 5G and see if I liked it.  I do.I don\'t have complex needs.  Other than good security, and frequent security updates, I also like good pictures and video.  The phone is light, the battery lasts a long time, the screen is just a little bit smaller than my iPhone 8 Plus and far lighter.The iPhone 8 Plus was a flagship at one time, and you can tell.  The build quality is phenomenol.  It\'s also heavy, feels expensive, and the feature set and ecosphere quite complete.  Almost heavy-ish.  I love the phone, and it\'s my backup now.  The Pixel 4a 5G is minimalist, light, leaves you ""uninvolved"" or slightly detached from the massive Google ecosphere, unless you go in and configure the various bits and pieces of it.I\'m very pleased with my purchase.  Refreshing alternative to Samsung.  Don\'t get me wrong, Samsung flagship is a beast.  But I never buy new $1000 plus phones.  So the best that I could do is buy a used or NOS Samsung Note, which I did (a Note 9), and it was a terrible experience.  Old android version, build quality was not too hot.  If you ever look at buying a flagship phone that is 2 or 3 versons behind, Samsung can\'t cut it.  Apple is much better in that scenario.  But I\'m glad that there\'s something that ""fills the gap"" between flagship phones, and just a nice, new, current, phone with frequent updates.

And it\'s THIN!  And it\'s LIGHT! - Only 168 grams!There\'s only one problem, however.  It is as fragile as a potato chip.  Six days ago, I was walking through my neighborhood with my nine-month-old Google Pixel 4A 5G in my front right pants pocket.  The Pixel was encased in a Spigen Tough Armor case and was equipped with a tempered glass screen protector.  Due to an unfortunate encounter with a dog, I tripped and fell - on my back, mind you.  I was fortunately not hurt (although to this day I hope that worthless dog gets struck by lightning), but when I pulled my Pixel out of my pocket to exchange phone numbers with the dog\'s owner, I discovered the damage you see in the attached pictures.  The phone display showed what I can only describe as a ""green screen of death.""  From that moment to now, the phone has been totally unusable.  The front screen is destroyed, the headphone jack is destroyed, and the back cover has partially separated from the front of the phone.  And all this from a drop of about 33 inches.  (I\'m not a tall guy!)  A drop that occurred while the phone was not only in its protective case, but was still in my pocket!Which leads to two philosophical questions.  First, if a phone has impressive capabilities, yet is too fragile to take with you on a walk, what good is it?  I don\'t play video games, nor do I watch movies on smartphones.  And if I want to take pictures, there are plenty of good cameras that I can buy.  My Pixel\'s capabilities are worthless to me now, and I am out $500 dollars for a phone that\'s turned into a piece of junk.Second, what\'s with the obsession that manufacturers and sellers of certain things have with weight and size?  We\'re constantly being bombarded with marketing that says that we should buy the lightest, thinnest versions of certain very expensive things - as if the presence of even two or three extra grams will pin us to the ground.  It\'s not like we\'re competing in the summer Olympics!  I am thinking right now of the Greek myth of Sisyphus being punished eternally by being forced to roll a large boulder up a hill only to have the boulder slip out of his hands just before he gets to the hilltop.  And I can imagine someone coming to him and saying, ""Dude - the reason you can\'t roll that rock over the hill is because of the smartphone you\'re carrying!  It adds weight and slows you down!  You should buy one of our phones, because they don\'t weigh anything more than air!""  Thin + light does not always equal ""cutting-edge quality.""  Thin + light = cheap sometimes.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ana', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on July 22, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Se entregó justo como dice la descripción, y es muy buen celular\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mohammad A.

My old Pixel 3 XL (4G LTE) gave me about 80 mbits/sec download, this phone gives me over 500 mbits/sec download.Size wise it's right in that sweet spot, it's a touch smaller than my Pixel 3 XL but not by much. I debated getting a Pixel 5 but it's a little too small, and for some reason there is no Pixel 5 XL, in a way you can think of the Pixel 4a(5G) as the Pixel5 XL. I find the fingerprint scanner on the back is perfectly positioned for my hand size, and the case (Spigen Tough Armor) I bought guides my finger directly to it so I can quickly unlock my phone.There are a few areas they could have improved on, I wish it had Gorilla Glass 6 and a 90HZ refresh rate like the Pixel 5 but in reality it doesn't really matter that much, the touch screen works fine and animations are smooth. It also lacks water resistance, but if you don't use it in the rain/snow and take care of it you'll be fine.

Google makes great phones. I haven't experienced any lag or any issues while texting, talking, or surfing the web.

Take it from a software engineer that writes apps professionally, this phone should not behave this way...Details below:I paid more and ordered a refurbished ""excellent"" quality phone, and I received a phone with scratches on the metal bezel and on the top left corner.If that was all, I would have forgiven them, but it wasn\'t.The phone that I got was really glitchy on the touch screen. Swipe down gestures were a joke. It was very laggy and not responsive on the touches and other swipe gestures (like back swipe), even after all the software updates and reboots.In fact, I have the same phone to compare it next to side by side and it was so bad compared to my other phone (that actually even had a broken screen). Something is not right with the way this company does their repairs.  After I discovered my probkems, I read the reviews. Whoops. Can\'t say I wasn\'t warned...I don\'t know if it originally had water damage, cheap parts, dropped in shipping, or what, but I was expecting much better from a top rated ""excellent"" quality refurbished phone.

When I started doing some research, I noticed this deal, where I could get a top-of-the-line phone from 2 years ago for less than half price. Spec-wise, this device is equivalent to the s22 ultra with very minor exceptions (EXTREMELY minor, like camera and variable refresh rate).Comparing this device to all the current budget phones from Google, Apple, Samsung, Nord, Moto, TCL, etc., this device seems to be the best value for the price. Between the refresh rate, battery, AMOLED HDR display (boasting 1400 nits of brightness) , stereo speaker audio, 12gb ram, security/software updates (for at least another couple of years at the time of writing), this phone is absolutely killer.The refurbished part scared me at first, as I normally buy all my devices new, but I have no complaints here. My device genuinely feels brand new.My only complaints about this phone are mostly personal problems rather than the phone being faulty. For example, I kind of hate how clear the front-facing camera is. I may need to get new glasses or something, but the picture is more detailed than looking in the mirror. When I take a selfie, I see all the disgusting blemishes in high detail (I'll work on being less ugly, but regardless, it maybe something to note if you take a lot of selfies, you may need some software to blend the photos a little better).Another complaint is the jarring effect of the main camera trying to switch focus. I don't take very many pictures, but if you're trying to take a fast picture, that might be an issue.The display does not allow for 144hz and 1440p at the same time. It's kind of a bummer, but I'm just excited to finally leave my 60hz life behind.Opening a couple of games, this phone performs extremely well, but I did find it odd that it did not allow for higher graphics options on games like Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal, since it defaulted these games to high graphics rather than highest (not that I play waifu simulator or Diablo Immoral, but I did need to benchmark my credit card somewhere).Lastly, this may be just my shipment, but the cord did not work for transferring data from my old Note 8 to the S20. Fortunately, you can transfer everything wirelessly, and the cord I got works for fast charging. It's just an odd issue worth noting.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this device. I don't normally write reviews, but here I am writing a book on my experience with it, so maybe that's a testimony in itself. Hopefully this helps someone on-the-fence about picking this one up.Edit: this was purchased from Edge Cellular\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone, Display, Speed.

I bought this phone refurbished from them in, supposedly, excellent condition. Basically meaning that it wouldn\'t have any scratches on the back of the phone or on the screen. Unfortunately, the phone had very clear signs of image burn-in. This was disheartening, seeing as to how I paid for a higher amount to get a product in better condition. It wasn\'t even advertised anywhere on the listing that it would potentially have display issues, much less actual burn-in. I had contacted them on the issue, and apparently they\'re not able to offer replacements, they gave me a choice of returning in for a full refund or keeping for a small partial refund equal to the difference of their excellent condition and good condition phones. I ended up going with the partial refund, because fortunately, it doesn\'t get in the way of any of my use with it. I would not recommend buying from them.Product: Now for those who want to know about the product itself and whether or not to buy it. The display is incredible, even in 2023\'s standards. I use the phone at 120hz with the lower resolution because I don\'t watch much media on it and mainly use it for social and gaming.  It supports 120hz refresh rate at 1080p resolution and 60hz at 1440p. The display itself is another great part of the phone, the colors you get with it are just amazing.  It is an AMOLED display with HDR10, which really helps with contrast between your blacks and whites and entire color spectrum.The phone comes equipped with 12gb of ram, allowing for not only a stutter-less gaming experience, but also quick multi-tasking with apps. I\'ve really enjoyed the phone for the time I\'ve had it, it\'s quick with any task I try to use it for, not once have I had an app lag or slow down. The crisp screen and smooth motion gives the premium experience you\'d want with a more expensive phone. The only real downsides I could even think of saying about this device is that it is an older phone, so software support won\'t last too much longer as of the time of writing this review; and this display doesn\'t have some of the more modern feature that the newer Galaxy phones have, such as Dynamic Refresh Rate, which basically optimizes the phone\'s use of the 120hz refresh rate.Overall, I\'d recommend getting this phone over newer ones at the same price point and even older flagships, it\'s a great price for all that you get with it, premium user experience, feel, and the camera is amazing even with it being a few years old.Though, if you\'re buying it refurbished like I did, I don\'t recommend buying it from ""GreenTech Refurbished"".\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Anonymous4847364899', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Review', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': ""My 3rd Samsung.

The last foldable phone I had was the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2. I liked it a lot but eventually grew tired of the heaviness and ended up selling it. I also found the tall, slim, remote control profile of the outer screen to be uncomfortable to use at times, not to mention its unwieldy reachability. Unfortunately, Samsung has chosen to stick with the tall, skinny, barely useable design of the outer screen. OnePlus, on the other hand, provides a normal size outer screen, much better hinge with almost no detectable crease when open, a larger screen and many say an even better camera (albeit a much more obtrusive one) than even the new Samsung Fold 6! And even though it does not have the IP48 submersible rating Samsung has or the wireless charging, it does come with a proprietory 67 watt fast charger in the box that allows it to charge the phone from zero to 100% in under 45 minutes. Neither Samsung nor the new Pixel Pro 9 foldable can achieve anywhere near that level of fast charging. And the OPO beats both of those products in battery life by a mile! It's a matter of personal preference of course but, for me, the OPO is the far superior choice . You may feel otherwise. Oh yeah, forgot to mention it's just as light to hold and carry around as the new Samsung Fold 6 despite having a wider outer screen and a bigger inner screen. And with 512 GB it is hundreds of dollars cheaper than a comparable new Samsung or Pixel foldable, especially with the trade-in deal OnePlus is offering. You should also know unfortunately, OnePlus is only offering three years of software updates for this phone and four years security updates, while Samsung is promising 7 years. But honestly, there's no way I'm going to hang on to this phone for three more years. I'll likely trade it in when the OnePlus Open 2 makes its debut next year or the year after.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Switched From Z Fold 6', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024', 'Review Body': ""So about a month ago I decided it was time to finally break away from the apple eco system. I was sick of it. I really liked the refined design of the fold 6 and knew I wanted something that felt vastly different from a candy bar form factor.The phone was great and had a lot of features that wowed me. The AI tools were fun and silly and the screens were bright and vibrant. I got blue bubbles working at home and thought I was good to go.A week passed and I realized I wasn't in love. That damn front screen is just so narrow. I have little hands. I'm a small guy. I didn't think it would bother me. I couldn't type a sentence on it to save my life. The cases for it added such a strange cheap bulky feeling to the phone and made me feel like I was carrying around a TV remote. The inner screen was so damn glossy, I couldn't see outside or even in my apartment for that matter because it reflected EVERYTHING around me and was covered in smudges in an instant. You can't set the phone down flat on a table because of the camera placement. It was also uncomfortable to hold with those sharp corners.The one plus open has fixed all of those issues for me. The inner screen feels so much more premium and the outer screen is a perfect size. I love the anti glare inside and can't get over how shallow the crease is. I honestly even like the OS more. Coming from iOS, it's a little more inviting. Of course I miss the wireless charging and AI features, but I can absolutely live without those. The cameras are so much better and I prefer the more tasteful image processing. Samsung pics look like an acid trip, they're so oversaturated. The OnePlus open feels so much more premium and carefully crafted. I also don't really need these phones to be much thinner...I like how solid the open feels. I don't feel like it's going to break every time I unfold it. While it may not be snapdragon 8 gen 3, gen 2 runs extremely well. Battery life is absolutely better even at high performance.So happy to join the OnePlus ecosystem.

There were so few substantial changes in those releases that I sold the Z Fold 5 within three months of ownership. I never enjoyed using the outer screen for anything, especially if I needed to enter data, because it was too narrow. The cameras were too much of a downgrade from their S-series phones. Although they had pen support, carrying one required a thicker case on an already large and heavy phone. I wear pants with large pockets, but the long skinny foldable would occasionally fall out while sitting down.While the Z Fold interface can be very good, there were too many duplicated apps that added little additional functionality, including their voice assistant. This unnecessarily increased overall complexity when using the phone.I also purchased the S24 Ultra with AI built in, but only for the Samsung apps. Since I don't use their browser, voice assistant, messaging, or mail I didn't have access to much AI on that phone. Plus, I had become accustomed to the larger inside screen and missed that part of the foldable experience.I then tried the Pixel Fold, but did not like its inability to easily lay flat, many apps did not display correctly on the large inside screen, it had heat issues when doing everyday things, and Google's pitiful history of pixel phone support (I have owned several early Pixel phones). I loved the outer screen aspect much better than the Z Fold.I read several reviews for the OnePlus Open that were so good I purchased one and these are my notes so far.Pros- the outer screen is the perfect height and width for typing with my larger thumbs- face unlock is more accurate and faster- it is lighter than the Z Fold and much lighter than the Pixel Fold- it charges in 42 minutes from 0%, so I do not miss or need wireless charging- its larger battery lasts longer than the Z Fold 5- while I am not a phone camera expert, my pictures are noticably better- the interface is much simpler and streamlined with minimal app duplication- I am surprised how much I like their Open Canvas multi-tasking implementation- the crease on the phone is much closer to being invisible than all  Z Folds or the Pixel FoldCons- not water or dust proof, just splash resistant- not a wide selection of good cases\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'luis y.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on April 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excelente teléfono\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Omran', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on August 19, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I was conflicted between this and the newly released Samsung fold 6 and decided to get this to test for a few days in hopes of returning it and getting the more expensive fold 6 if I wasn't totally satisfied with the purchase.I am so far beyond impressed and totally satisfied with my purchase.

It looked like a new phone, couldn\'t find a single sign it had been used. The plastic film was still on the back and sides. For the price it was a great buy. I cant see spending more than a few hundred dollars on one and this was in the $250 area total. There are a couple things I don\'t care for but have nothing to do with it being ""renewed"". The battery life leaves a bit to be desired. My last couple phones all had batteries in the 5000mA range so this having only a 3300mA battery is very noticeable, no more lasting all day and charging at night while sleeping like I\'ve been doing for years with my Moto G Stylus 5G phones(2021&2023 models).I\'m used to using the tempered glass screen protectors which can\'t be used on this one. I\'ve tried a couple of the flexible film ones with it but wasted the money because couldn\'t get them to install properly(without air bubbles everywhere). The phone screen is soft. It will get dents/creases in it if not careful(I put a light crease in mine trying to install a screen protector).  When opened its not perfectly flat, there\'s a shallow area where the fold is but it\'s not  visually noticeable with the screen on at all. Only noticeable by touch and visually when the screen is off. The non expandable memory isn\'t a feature I like. 128GB isn\'t a whole lot nowadays, especially when it\'s common for apps to be 1GB-3GB(like games and Facebook). I used to keep my games, photos, and entertainment/social media apps on a SD card but now I\'m just being a lot more selective with what I install and quick to uninstall something if it\'s not being used regularly, whereas with expandable memory I\'d just leave them on the SD card. I read that it will no longer receive updates from Samsung so Android 14 is going to be the last operating system upgrade for it.Size is the reason I bought it. Got tired of carrying phones that only fit in back pockets and still have 1/4 of it sticking out. With this I get the same size screen but can put it in any pocket. It\'s unlocked compatible with GSM and CDMA service providers so works with all the major ones.All in all it\'s a good phone loaded with features, looks and functions like a new one for 1/2 the price,and it\'s second life is helping the planet with saving resources and landfill space.

This one being foldable easily fits.  There were some big differences in this phone compared to all of my previous cell phones.  For starters, there is no phone jack. Not a deal breaker if you have Blue Tooth ear buds.  Second big difference, there is no slot of a micro SD memory card.  I worked around that by buying a phone with 128 G of internal memory.  That\'s more than enough for all of my music, games, photos and apps.  The third big difference is there are 2 batteries, and they aren\'t easy to replace.  Instead of just removing a cover, there is some disassembly involved to get to them.  I may leave that to the ""Pros"" when the time comes to replace them.  There are tons of videos out there demonstrating all of the features of this phone, so I won\'t go into detail about it.  I will say that I watched a few of them to tweak some display and battery settings to extend the life of the battery such at limiting the percentage of charges.  I just found out it\'s not good on a battery when you charge it 100%.  Didn\'t know that before.  For you Tracfone users, I will confirm that you can take this unlocked phone to Tracfone, put your sim card from your old phone in it, and with a little help from a Tracfone tech, be ready to use it in under 15 minutes.  I thought I needed a Tracfone Sim card kit, and I didn\'t.  In the past I had to wait a few hours up to a day for the new phone to be fully functional - not this time.  Like I said, within 15 minutes it was working.  I wear a hearing aid, and once I configured the phone to work with my hearing aid app, it used the Bluetooth to send audible notifications to my hearing aid.  My wife is thrilled she doesn\'t have to hear my phone announce email and phone calls while we watch TV. I can also play music on my phone and hear it through my hearing aid.  Cool!  I\'m 76 years old, and I found this phone relatively intuitive in its operation.  It only took me a day or two of playing with it to learn my way around.  So far I like it.  I ordered screen protectors and a case to give it protection.  As a renewed cell phone it arrived in excellent shape, like new.  UPDATE 7/8/24  I did find one thing I really don\'t like about the Android 14 operating system - it\'s very difficult to turn on the Data setting.  It\'s a convoluted path to reach a setting that offers only 1 option, to keep ""data turned on when wi-fi isn\'t available"" all of the time. For someone who uses prepaid Tracfone services that don\'t have unlimited data, I have to limit my usage of data.  It took me a half hour to find directions how to access that setting, not fun!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'SAME Computers', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on October 4, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Para ser equipo refurbished está en muy buenas condiciones y además funciona perfectamente.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Doug Henderson', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on January 11, 2023', 'Review Body': ""I prefer small-size phone in general and loved iPhone OS so I never thought I would buy an Android phone.

Only one place has tiny small cometic scratch is on the middle of backcase where the phone is folding, but it is hardly noticeable. Switching from iPhone to Android is painful because Apple didn't make it easy to transfer contacts to android. But it worths the trouble to make this change for me. Over all, I will recommend this seller and the Flip 3.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The hinge shuts the phone off and wont come back on...\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'JOSE FELIX SOLIS HERNANDEZ', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on May 26, 2023', 'Review Body': 'He comprado dispositivos anteriormente y sin ningún problema en lo absoluto, en el caso de esté, desde la entrega fue un problema, pagué un envío ""rápido” y el producto llegó 3 días después de la entrega prevista con un envío gratuito, el dispositivo se empezó a usar desde el 19 de mayo (un día después de la recepción) y para el día 24 ya estaba dañado el uso que se le dio fue mínimo y de un trato delicado, lo cerré para dejar de usarlo y al abrirlo está la pantalla negra como si estuviera roto,en las fotos podrán ver la estética de 10 de el equipo y el error, menos mal que ocurrió dentro de el periodo de garantía del mismo, así que pude solicitar el reembolso.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Excelente teléfono, muy comodo', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on September 20, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Todo\nRead more'}]",7.462686567164178,B09GBLFSB2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09GBLFSB2,5g

The seller claims that the battery has a certain capacity but when i go into my battery setting it tells me that my battery has more power than the advertised power the seller claims - but why is my device malfunctioning the way it is? Because it's defective. If I had known what I know now I wouldn't have tried solving the problem and I would've returned it within the time-frame required. I tried everything to solve this issue such as trying all different types of chargers with different watts and I've tried all different types of charging wall ports... device when not in use for less than 10 minutes drops over 10%. I'm very upset with this purchase and the lost of my money into a defective item that barely works. I don't have much income at all so this is really frustrating.

Amazon refused to honor replacement arrangement.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I received the phone within 2 days of ordering. The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement.

You can search online that issue.Tests I did show that the touchscreen responds when the finger is actually is not touching the screen but is 0.5- 1mm ( 1/52"" - 2/52"") away from it!This leads of course to an absurd overreaction when you handle the phone, even with the palm protection on, it reacts unintentionally. Often even it responses before you have actually touched anything simply because you moved your finger without touching the screen!Then there is the OS, by now Android 14. Another effort to overload an overdo many functions and poorly organize them. all of course in the eternal other obsession ""security"". The [settings] interface is not intuitive and straightforward anymore like it used to be in older android OSs.Whereas like in earlier versions you could customize and prioritize which icon functions you wanted where, that no longer seems to be possible.And then of course the confirmation pop-up window mania.Say you want to turn something off or delete a message/email. You have to go on a regular basis through three confirmations! DUH? Say you select an email or SMS and click on delete, then it asks you first if you want to delete it, and then and then again were you wanted deleted to and finally you need to confirm that! Really? Seriously?notwithstanding that the new and improved absolutely outlandish privacy terms and all other terms all of them with their 10,000 links to other terms about terms and privacy etc. blah blah... I really feel being raped on a daily basis.Furthermore for some reason despite larger screen all the fonts are smaller but layout spacing is larger with more wasted space. (yes I tried the font sizing). Total useless another feature is, that you can choose from an endless variety of different fonts...Any app you start needs a gazillion confirmations requesting permission to give access to this and that, here and there etc. etc. Overall straightforward sensible layout of the interface and functionality is gone.Here\'s a personal comparison and experience.Before I upgraded to this phone I had a Samsung S5 with OS Android 6.01. Everything worked fine I never had an issue SMS and MMS sent out instantaneously and everything else worked. Of course with new apps the phone became, aside from artificial incompatibilities, slower and slower. P part of a marketing ploy probably.Now I have a Samsung A14 5G with Android 14. MMS take much longer and needs two or three confirmations...And when executing a functioning in an app, next time I open the app I have to navigate back as it doesn\'t go back like previously by default.There\'s more but that would take up too much space to writeup here.Remember the peaceful relaxed time when we had a Bell telephone and a typewriter?We were able to communicate and even managed to fly two men to the moon and bring them safely back...\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Internetsuperstar', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best Phone Deal—Galaxy A14 5G is a Game Changer', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Let me tell you, folks, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G—factory unlocked, 64GB, black, renewed—is an absolute steal.

Keeping it due to longer software support', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023', 'Review Body': 'I bought a Moto x4 many years ago and have been perfectly content with it. After it updated to Android 9 I didn\'t like the fact that you could no longer see all open apps in the new window-switching view, and it forced a google search toolbar, and a number of other things I thought were worse, so I used directions on xda to revert back to 8.1.I was perfectly happy with this for many years.Then a security-related app I was using notified me that Android 8.1 was not secure and has not received security updates for years. So I have to get the latest version of Android.Then I find out that Motorola doesn\'t publish security or Android version updates to the phone past Android 9, so my only option is to buy a new phone or flash a 3rd party ROM. I looked for instructions and ROMs, and LineageOS seemed to be the primary other option, but I ran into many problems.So I looked up what phones were similar to the Moto x4 and provided the longest term of security and software updates. Samsung Galaxy A14 5G seemed to be the winner so I bought it. It\'s 6 years newer than my Moto x4 so it should be an enjoyable upgrade at least right? Wrong.* It\'s much thicker and taller. Too tall for my liking; difficult to use with one hand - yes I\'ve tested the ""one-handed features"".* The fingerprint reader is worse. The Moto x4\'s works 90%+ of the time, the A14\'s works about 40% of the time.* The battery takes many hours more (can be more than twice as long) to recharge (via USB 3.0 to my PC) and drains as fast or faster.* No call recording.* No view all open apps ability.* Various other annoyances related to how the software functions on this phone/android version.The only noticeable improvements are more customization of notifications & layout.New Android versions & phones are barely different and many of the changes are often downgrades. Hyping them up and making us buy new phones to get security updates is such a scam. My Moto x4 could have lasted me another decade at least.I hate the smartphone industry.

Arrived withAndroid 13 installed. Phone was well packed and came in a plain box with a nice 5Volt 2Amp (9Volt 1.87Amp) charger, USB C charging cable, and SIM Tray removal tool. The box was labeled NEW. The model I received is SM-G986U1. It is NEW, Pristine, Looks and Performs Flawlessly. The phone is Fully Unlocked for all US carriers GSM and CDMA. I put my SIM card and SD card in the dual SIM tray, powered up and in a short while I was up and running. I used the included Smart Switch app to transfer everything from my old Samsung phone. The phone is fast, color and graphics are great. WiFi and Bluetooth connect easily and work flawlessly. Phone connects quickly to Tracfone/Verizon mobile network and switches smoothly between LTE and 5G as I travel along. My Cell service is Tracfone through Verizon. The S20+ supports most of the LTE bands and 5G bands used by Verizon. This is important especially if you live or travel in a weak signal area with Verizon or other CDMA carrier. I don’t know about GSM carriers.  I  first ordered the S20 FE, which, I found out, does not support the mmWave bands needed for the fastest 5G Verizon service or reliably connect to Verizon in my weak signal home location. As a result I couldn’t get connected unless I walked outside my house into my driveway. Someone living in a strong signal area would not notice unless they travel into a weak signal area. This seems to be a problem with the design of the S20 FE and not the fault of the Renewer or Amazon. I wasn't willing to wait and try a replacement S20 Fe 5G so, unfortunately I had to send the S20 FE 5G back, I ordered the S20+ 5G instead. I'm very happy with my decision and with my S20+ 5G which supports 5G mmWave and reliably connects to Verizon in my weak signal area.I can’t say enough good about Stalion Requip.

Shipped fast and arrived early.  Thank you.This phone is great.  The screen is clear, bright and very dim when that's required too.  The internals are snappy and responsive, audio is loud and crystal clear.  Overall it feels like a solid pocket computer.The only negative I have found is the fingerprint reader.  Since it's on the front, under the screen, only thumbprints make sense, and it's sloooow!  Its also unusable if my hands are not completely clean and dry.  I'm always doing filthy things working with my hands, so usually I just swipe and unlock with a pattern.  Coming from years of using LG phones, Samsung could take some pointers on the fingerprint scanner function and location.  It makes me sad that LG is not making pocket computers anymore.  Samsung is good, LG was better overall I think.  Still, it's a good machine for good value.Edit:  the fingerprint reader has stopped functioning completely.  Its is fully useless except as a blingy gimmick.  If you need a phone that will unlock via fingerprint, don't buy this.UPDATE: apparently Samsung is junk.  Dropped last month and even inside full armor, the back glass cracked.  Who builds a phone using glass on the back?  Dumb.  The phone started glitching badly yesterday, one week after warranty expiration.  Lol, typical.  I had to reset the phone 3 times today and the camera and gallery will both cause the phone to lock up requiring a hard reset.  Cannot recommend this or any Samsung phone.  Waste of money, resources, time and energy.  Back to LG quality for as long as I can get one.  None of my old LG phones have failed, they've been upgraded and put away, all still work fine.

The time format on the lock screen is the only thing I don't prefer so far: very large numbers, hour on one line, minute below that, and there is no way to change the format. The phone is fast, works as it should, and comes with a clear, lightweight plastic case which offers a better grip than smooth metal and is all the protection a careful person might need.  It comes with a European-style plug-in for the wall, and a USB to USB C charging cord.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'G. Garrison', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Wow! What a nice phone.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I had a BLU G90 PRO that was having minor issues. I went with this moto g54 and Wow, what a nice phone. It transferred my contacts and photos without me even knowing. Only took about 15 minutes to set up. Nothing bad to say about the G54 as of now. The camera has slow motion, time lapse and night vision..the pics are pretty crisp day and night. Stereo speakers sound decent. Bluetooth headphones and ear buds sound fantastic. Build quality and feel is great. And this phone thankfully gives you the 3.5mm aux. jack input. Fingerprint sensor on the power button works verrry fast. You also get 8 gig ram and 256k storage. Final thoughts: For what this Moto cost you'd have to nit pick it to death to give a bad review in my opinion.

Been a customer for years. Last year I had an iPhone 12 pro max gifted to me (not an apple fan at all). Used for a year. Broke that needed this in a pinch. Let me say great phone!I absolutely love moto features and the moto battery and this phone holds up to the expectations well.I personally don't like the leather back but that's 100% personal. The phone is super lightweight which I also don't love. It makes a device feel cheap to me but I know most people really enjoy this feature so I won't deduct points for that. I also really like the slim sleak design, looks and feels nice.Works super fast and so easy to customize everything how you like. You don't have to download any separate apps it's all built in to your liking. Amazing battery life perusal from Motorola.Phone comes with nice charger and even better a case! Just a plain clear case, not to bulky. Keeping the nice slim look of the phone which I like. And you can decorate the case yourself which I also like.The thumb print censor is great and works really well for me.Where the phone really falls short is the camera. Overall just not good. You have to have crazy bright light for anything close to desent and that really sucks. I've had older ( more expensive) moto models that were much better camera. Certainly no comparison to the iPhone.I have metro for carrier and was unable to just put the Sim in so if you're with them be prepared for some mess around also.Overall for the price 8 out of 10\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Christophe Caltagirone', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Excellent phone for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Had to update to be able to use an app that required Android 12.0 or later.This is an excellent phone at this price point.

I was surprised by the high-quality cardboard packaging, the contents consisting of a telephone, charging cable, tool for the card slot, a short operating manual and even a transparent soft cover with a pleasant feel. Since I was “catapulted” from Android 8 (my old Huawei) to Android 12 in the Blackview, I first looked for information about Android 12 on the Internet before setting it up, which later turned out to be helpful (and in my opinion also represents a user manual ). In most cases, anything that wasn\'t clear to me could be researched online.What was unusual for me was the fingerprint sensor on the side “power” button. On my old Huawei, the recognition was on the back in the upper third, which is an advantage in my opinion. But I knew that when I ordered it and I\'ll definitely get used to it.\ufeffCredit goes to customer service who I contacted with a technical question. It gets the rating “5 stars” from me. The service employee who advised me was personal, friendly and competent and emails were answered the next day at the latest.\ufeffConclusion: Anyone who buys a phone will first consider which claims and requirements should be covered. The Blackview A 53 clearly exceeded my price-performance expectations. It makes a high-quality impression and meets my requirements: calling and taking photos in good quality, navigation and Bluetooth reliably, speed on the network and image structure/brightness as well as storage capacity of 64 GB are absolutely sufficient for me. If this is then supported by remarkable customer service, then the whole thing is “highly recommended” in my opinion.""\nRead more'}]",,B0D1QB8SK2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D1QB8SK2,4g

When it arrived, I put my SIM card from my other phone into this one and I was making and receiving calls and texts within minutes. The data from my other phone - apps, contacts, saved files, etc. - transfered quickly and smoothly and I was up and running in no time. The processor is very fast, the cameras are crisp and calls are clear. The battery only lasts 2 days - not as long as some other phones - but I am never far from power. So, I don't mind. But the best part of this phone was the price. At under $100, it fit my very tight budget.Not gonna lie, I bought this same phone from a different seller for about $40 less before I bought this phone. What a nightmare! I'll just say that the phone didn't work... AT ALL and I had to return it. Then, I bought this phone from this seller. The description for this phone was clear, complete, it answered all my questions and a few I didn't even know I needed to ask. Most importantly, it was honest. No information was omitted whether it was important or trivial and nothing was misrepresented. The phone I received is, and works, precisely as it was described - unlike the previous phone from the other seller.  This seller, unknowingly, turned a bad experience into a good one. For that, I am very grateful. The Moto One Ace may not be the phone for everyone, but this seller definitely is. You can trust that you will get the products they describe, just as they describe them.

It has a generally slower processor, so it won't outcompete much of the flagship phones of today, or its time, as it was released in 2021, but it is a solid phone with an outstanding battery life, which is the main reason that makes this a phone to buy.

I\'ve got lots more apps I can use. The trouble is that the thing is WAY too sensitive. If you touch it, it comes on to tell you the time. Can\'t figure out how to make it stop doing that. If I carry it in my pocket I\'ll wind up with 5-10 apps opened up when I thought it was on standby. I had to put in my fingerprint to start up and now if my wife wants to answer the phone she has to come borrow my finger to get into the thing. If I\'m watching a video and the phone rings, I dare not miss the answer button or the phone goes away I don\'t know where. I admit it, I\'m 70 years old and millenial Chinese phone designers have no idea what is an intuitive operating system for someone like me. I anticipate a long long learning curve.  Also, the charger/PC port uses an odd size plug rather than the standard C plug my old phones, my camera and other stuff use and I can\'t find an adapter from their so I have to carry around the cord if I don\'t want to risk the phone dying and leaving me stranded without even an Uber call I can make. Woe is me if I lose that cord. I\'ll probably have to buy a dozen of them cause sure as the sun rises, I\'m going to lose several before it\'s all over. I\'m going to have to go full Bluetooth for headphones because after a week the headphone jack won\'t let me fully plug the phone jack in. I\'ll have to live with it\'s quirks. I can\'t afford to wait for it to be repaired. I don\'t want to set up another one (I spent a week figuring the thing out), and I need my phone. There are some things I\'m happy with. If I can just consistently answer a phone call without the thing losing the phone screen, I\'ll probably be okay.

I will try to be detailed as I know I read hundreds of reviews before finally feeling secure with my purchase, so hopefully I can help someone out here.The box it arrived in was old and dirty so I was extremely nervous to open it, but once I did I was very impressed. The phone itself was in phenomenal, like new condition. I was very happy to see everything included in the box (sim key ejector, charging cable, plug in adapter) so that was great since some of the reviews I read said parts were not included or missing, ect.The phone needed to be charged right away, and as soon as I plugged in it, the included wall adapter started making a very high pitched buzzing sound, so I swapped it out with a different adapter I already had on hand (you can get them anywhere so not a big deal) and problem was instantly solved.I am completely unfamiliar with Samsung phones, so I was worried about set up, but once I was easily able to change the language from Spanish to English, it was pretty easy to do.I really liked how crisp and clear the graphics were and the phone has a great screen size for gaming. I will say that in my opinion the phone is pretty laggy in loading, but my 12 year old doesn’t really seem to mind and after pretty much living on it for the past two days, it’s safe to say he loves the phone.It took some doing to familiarize ourselves with it, and found it was not as user friendly as an iPhone, but once you figure out how to actually gets the apps on the Home Screen and change the clock, ect, you’re good to go.Pros: great screen size, clear graphics, amazing battery life, 12 year old approved.Cons: A little laggy, not the most user friendly until you get used to it, weird buzzing adaptor.Note: we have not tried installing a SIM card as of yet, so I can’t attest to that.So far this phone has been great, well worth the purchase price, and my son is extremely happy with it, so for that, I would absolutely recommend it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gabriela V.', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on February 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Puse a cargare el celular y el cargador se calento muchisimo estubo a punto de explotar o tener un corto circuito en la casa.\nRead more'}]",5.617977528089887,B09Z8P34NM,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09Z8P34NM,4g

I bought this S21+ along with an ""Orange Holiday Europe"" SIM card.The phone arrived in excellent condition, with no scratches or dents. The screen appeared to have been replaced. After setting it up, I tested it by installing SIM cards from AT&T and TELLO, both worked perfectly - it\'s definitely unlocked.Right before the trip, I installed the ""Orange"" SIM card with the phone powered down. Upon arrival in Italy I powered it up, and it immediately connected to the local service. We used Google Maps to get from the airport to our hotel some 50km\'s away, no problems at all.Photos taken on the trip were excellent. We installed Google Translate and Microsoft Translator which worked perfectly and were a real asset in helping us navigate the foreign signs, menus, etc. We also set up Hot Spot and Tethering, and used that along with wireless calling on our US SIM based phones to make and receive free calls and texts to/from US numbers. It all worked as expected with no issues.There are two minor issues to report.The battery life was OK, I would start each day at 100%  but by end of day it typically had around 30% remaining. My new (locked) S23+ easily gets two days on a single charge.I did notice a minor blemish on the screen after a week of using it. At first I thought it was just a greasy smear, but no amount of cleaning has managed to remove it. I didn\'t notice this when I first received the phone so it most likely manifested after use. It would seem to be a flaw with the screen itself. I did not use a screen protector, which may or may not have helped to prevent it from occurring. Fortunately it\'s close to the bottom of the screen and has not really affected the viewing area, nor has it affected the touch screen in the area of the blemish.All-in-all I am happy with this phone. I plan to use it for future international trips as it can do what I need without having to pay the $10-a-day AT&T International Roaming plan - that soon gets very expensive with 2 or more phones.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ryan A.

The split screen, stacked widgets and all apps view that most models probably have has completely changed my user experience. No more app icons & folders all over my screens. Modern feel.

About 3-4 months after I received it I had a few instances of being called and the phone calls went straight to voicemail even though I did not have my phone set to airplane mode.  Over the next couple months I had times that my text messages would not go through. I knew it was not the Network Verizon as my 2 boys have their phones on my plan and they were right next to me and their phones worked.  Then a big issue started happening in which the \'voice\' part of the phone only worked intermittently.  I use Bixby & Google Assistant, and even though they were set up properly, they only worked sometimes and not others.  Bixby would perhaps hear and pop up on the screen, but not respond to my voice for the request.  Other times it worked correctly.  Just yesterday and today alone I have had to reboot my phone 3 times when I could not use either of those or my talk to text as the microphone and speaker were not working.  I contacted the seller first - never heard from them.  I next contacted Amazon two days in a row and was told there is nothing they can do.  I just finished with my last chat being told this once again.  I told them that had I known I was paying $200 for a phone that would only work a few months - I never would have purchased it.  This is what was erroneously in their item description:  About this item  This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors.  This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.

They don't care if it is missing features, even if you are a 25-year customer, because you did not buy it from them. That is what I am dealing with now. In my initial review I indicated you have to visit a store to finish setup because that's what I was told through a Verizon chat. They did swap out the SIM card , but could not do anything else. I was told they do not do any software flashing, they are not even sure what that means, and there was nothing they could do at the retail store to help me.  I had to call the call center again which I literally did from their parking lot because I told them it was the second time I had visited a store and they're representative had told me to go to the store! I spent 2 hours working with, or on hold with, the call center, and still did not get the correct functionality!  They really don't care and don't want to help you unless you pay the astronomical amount of money to get a phone directly from them. My phone still drops calls, does not always call out, does not have voicemail, and does not have the spam filtering. So now I am stuck with either living with that, or paying to upgrade to another phone. The whole reason I bought this one off Amazon is because it still has the micro SD slot and that is what I want. I'm going to try to make it work, I'm very upset with Samsung that they are doing away with the SD slots and hope someday they will bring it back.The bottom line for me is the phone works okay. I have to dial in to get my voicemail now and had to have all of that reset, there is no voicemail icon. There is no way for me to know I have a voicemail I just have to call to see if I have any messages. So if you are okay with a phone that doesn't quite have perfect functionality, then this is a great one. It is decent for the money. If you want a phone that works just like one you would get from the store, bite the bullet and spend the money and go to Verizon.  I have gone to two stores, I have done one chat, and been on the phone with them, multiple agents, for over 2 hours. Apparently this is as good as it's going to get for this phone.Feb 23 initial review:  I read a few of the reviews, somehow I miss the part where if you get a phone off of a site like amazon, you do still have to take it into your provider for setup? My provider is Verizon. I happened to go in there yesterday and said I had a different phone (had both with me) they told me just to move the SIM card and the SD card over and they did not have to do anything. Today only half of the phone functions, and through a chat they told me I have to come in to have their software flashed onto the phone. I was already there and took the time to drive there and wait etc, only to find out that was not necessary. Now it is necessary because the phone doesn't function correctly. Hopefully once that is done it will be fine.Facial recognition does not work as well as I had thought it would. I will probably erase and try again but it consistently does not recognize my face. I did try to put a screen protector on and I adjusted the touch sensitivity but the phone still did not recognize a touch so I had to take that off. I'm a little nervous about having a screen without a protectorI am a Samsung Galaxy lover, I have the s4, the s5, and the s9. I stuck with the s20 because it has the SD card slot. So far so good, there are some things I don't like about the phone, but it's a good value for the money so far\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Teghan', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on February 26, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Nice and works well\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'William Bartlett', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on July 21, 2023', 'Review Body': 'I bought this for a relative that needed a new phone and I was worried because I\'ve seen/heard a lot of horror stories about renewed/refurbished phones, but this phone was unlocked, has ample battery life, and no physical damage.The only ""problem"" is that when you boot up the phone there is an AT&T logo and some of the software is AT&T based, but it still works in Canada with Bell, so it\'s more of a weird quirk than an issue.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Constanza Mateus', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on April 24, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Llevo aproximadamente un mes con el celular, todo ha funcionado bien, los primeros días se calentaba un poco, cambie la calidad de la resolución de pantalla y ya no se calienta.Recibí un celular de buena calidad por un precio muy económico.

I then get responses it's been sent, I say perfect, 5 days later ask again. I'm told it's been delivered. It hadn't been delivered though. I'm then told check your mail tomorrow, still not there. I ask for tracking and get silence. Inform them I use USPS informed delivery and no package or envelope from them has been recorded coming to my address.

All the apps worked (I don\'t use many, mostly auto locks, video and news media, etc.)  It set up with 5G Spectrum no problem but took about 45 minutes to fully operate.  I also had to restart three times to get a connection but don\'t know if it would have worked otherwise.  No big deal anyway.  This has a nice response, good screen, and acceptable performance.  Nice color and everything seems to work fine.  I like the ability to increase local memory with the scan cards.  Way cheaper than apple and you can take them out and plug into your local computer for very fast transfers and control.  Much faster than any other method for huge files.  The camera on this unit is fine.  Not State of the Art but hey this is not a pro camera anyway.  Want to do photos get the real thing.  This is just a nice machine for those daily snaps.  Seems we have gotten used to regular photos so this is OK.  One thing after having a small frame phone like the SE2022 this thing is huge.  It really doesn\'t fit anywhere.  And the screen use seems made more to get more on it than it does to make things larger and more readable.  The messages font seem to match the screen.  Very small or too large.  Just like the smaller phone.  The photos are nice, larger.  I bought this in ""acceptable"" condition, used saving about 260 from the list price.  It is worth it.

On her walk to school or youth programs or doing chores or whatever she can easily listen to music. Slight issue with paring her head phones but that was a headphones issue. So all in all. I recommend if other parents are like me and looking for a easy cheaper way to get their kids music.I did have to make her a google account and then go into parent controls and link it to mine via her phone and then mine. And then downloaded an app on my phone(iPhone) to remotely control. Once I figured that out it was easy.Only small issue was setting her time to the right time zone. It lagged so I spent an hour trying to fix it. And then finally gave up but a few hours later it was magically on the right time zone.Happy with the purchase I got her a screen protector and an otterbox that came in the recommended add ons.

Main camera almost always makes something blurry. The 200mp is better, but not perfect. Honestly it may have something to do with the default camera software not being very good.

Here are my thoughts after using it for the past few months:Pros of the 13 pro:- Very efficient battery (I can go 2 days without charging if I use it moderately)- Good camera, esp for a budget phone (although I\'m not sure if I can turn off the auto-focus / auto-blur function). The top camera (for close-range shots) is super clear, but the bottom one (for zoomed out shots) is on the fuzzier side, unfortunately.- High storage: having 256 GB really set aside my worries with going overboard on my photo gallery.- Great aesthetics: whoever designed it did a wonderful job cause it\'s probably the prettiest phone I\'ve owned to date.Cons:- Doesn\'t show any call indicators, so I can\'t just ""tap into"" my ongoing call. Instead, I have to go into my phone app in order to view the call or visit the App Vault, which can be annoying.- Xiaomi transfer between phones didn\'t work the best; I\'ll probably have to get a usb-c to -c cable to connect my two phones to successfully transfer all the loose ends.Overall, I think this is a really great phone with neat features, and has made me excited for future iterations of the Redmi Note series.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Romario G.', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Amazing functionality battery and connectivity', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The device is amazing.

Came from an S9', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn\'t even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I\'m happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I\'m a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I\'ve watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I\'m not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don\'t recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I\'ve taken pictures of people and shown them, and they\'ve been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don\'t think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven\'t had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M Mullins', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Love love love! Best phone I've ever had! Came from an A series phone!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022', 'Review Body': ""My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'james gettle', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Like how easy to use.

It\'s *just* smart enough that it will run the few apps I need (bank app, MFA, email) while otherwise working like an old dumb phone.But this is no dumb phone.  I can do just about everything I could do on my old rectangle with this.  Yeah, it\'s a little slower, the screen is smaller, and you have to type things out in tap/T9, but the latter two are features as far as I\'m concerned.The great thing about this phone is that, if I need to, I can do anything I could do with my old phone, but it\'s *just* annoying enough that I don\'t want to make a habit out of it.If you\'re a social media addict, this phone is not for you.  (Again, a feature from my view).  If you\'re looking to downsize to something that\'s not a time/attention suck but can\'t give up a few necessary apps, this is definitely for you.Pros:- Great for digital detox while still allowing access to apps you have to have- Feels way more comfortable in your hand compared to the boring, cookie-cutter rectangles- Screen is surprisingly crisp and readable for being portrait-oriented VGA.  (480x640)- Browsing the web is surprisingly snappy and fluid (used FF mobile and Chrome)- The programmable key can be used to toggle the flashlight- Good call quality.  Supports VoLTE and VoWiFI (at least it does on T-Mobile)- Solid build, water resistant (haven\'t tested), and durable- Physical keys- Has GPS, and map apps work- Most apps seem to just work even though this is Android Go instead of vanilla Android. The few apps that didn\'t work just didn\'t work correctly on the small screen (most apps scaled just fine).- WiFi hotspot works (may be carrier dependent; my plan allows it).- Supposedly unlockable bootloader.  I\'m buying a second one of these to experiment with custom ROMS; hopefully a newer version of Android can work since these come with, and are stuck at, Android 11.- Minimal bloatware.  I disabled pretty much all of the default/Google apps and replaced them with better alternatives from F-Droid.  The only pre-installed app that cannot be disabled (without rooting, anyway) is the T-Mobile app.Meh:- Speaker is just okay.  You\'d think with the space available it would be a little better.  Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to write home about.- The default Google apps aren\'t really optimized for the small screen.  Google Maps, in particular, with its ridiculous amount of clutter was frustrating to use (granted, it\'s become frustrating to use even on a larger phone).  Installed Organic Maps from F-Droid, and problem solved.  GPS seems accurate and even works indoors.Cons:- Camera is not great.  It\'s a little better than the cameras on flip phones of yore, but don\'t expect anything like you\'re used to with even the worst smartphones.  It\'s basically an afterthought.  If you\'re in broad daylight, they\'ll probably turn out okay.  If you\'re inside without full illumination, you\'re better off committing the moment to memory than trying to capture it with this.- Dead end device.  Bullitt, the manufacturer of these, left the phone market in early 2024.  All CAT phones were made by them, and these are the last of them.  It has two updates (which it should check for during initial setup), but after that, it\'s stuck in time on Android 11.  Which is really sad because I love this thing, and it\'s truly one of a kind.- Programmable key is limited in what it can be programmed to do.  It\'s also not recognized by the KeyMapper app.  Long pressing it can do one of a few pre-programmed actions or launch an app. Double-clicking it can do a bit more, but that is the only action which can turn on the flashlight, so I leave it on that.- Outer screen is very low resolution and sometimes the indicators are cropped off.  Also, sometimes the outer screen will show a really tiny, low-res version of the inner screen when you close the phone (will \'reset\' to the proper status display if you press a volume button or the programmable button).- The default launcher does not allow adding web apps to home screen.  I thought this was an Android Go limitation at first, but after replacing the default launcher with a different one, that functionality became available.- The default T9 keyboard annoyingly does not remember the last mode you had it in.  I tend to use tap mode for most things, but it always defaults to T9 English despite showing ""Abc"" mode.  Replaced that with Traditional T9 from F-Droid.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Clover', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great multi-functional flip phone!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Arrived much earlier than expected and has exceeded my expectations on what it could do! It was very easy for me to set up and get working on less than 30 minutes (Transfer from TMobile android smartphone to TMobile android go/lite flip phone). Incredibly sturdy and durable, I've dropped it a couple times being clumsy and you would barely even notice. The screen is small (obviously) but works incredibly well with little to no lag. It isn't too heavy and fits very well in my pockets. Definitely worth the cost! (If any changes occur I will update this review.

I like the loud speakerphone and audio section. No headphone jack. Usb-c headphone dongle included in box. I use Bluetooth and that works great. The phone is sturdy as can be. Can drop in puddle and not worry about it. Display brightness good. Battery life will vary depending on your location preferences and settings. Should easily last all day once you load it up. SD card slot for expansion. Alot of apps available in google go store.  The front notification screen is good, and you can set a mini wallpaper for it. This phone is definitely worth $60. I use metropcs. No problems activating in store.The cons-Food apps dont work normally. One time the taco bell app worked. Then it just quit. Cant fix it. Reinstall does nothing. Cant use. Mcdonalds failed completely today. Cant use. Little Caesars app works, but takes some doing. You see, alot of your experience actually depends on your font size. If youre font is too big, the phone will push things offscreen and not let you scroll to see them. So i had to adjust font to max small to register for little Caesars. Sometimes i use chrome to go to the food websites instead to order. Hassle. Amazon wont work for me either. Walmart pickup also doesn't generate the barcode so they can scan at the store. Had a big issue yesterday with that. Cant do store pickup now. It did work for our movie tickets. By the way, max small font on a tiny screen is SMALL. but the screen is crisp and responsive. Texting is a chore. Forget about driving and doing anything on this thing. Especially if you set a security pin. But for me its good because im trying to purposely cut down on cell use, especially while driving. If you have to use this phone while you're driving, you have to pull over. Forget about surfing the web. Just a chore. Havent tried doordasher app but i do have google maps. Chances are the doordasher app wouldnt work or be reliable.Bottom line this thing is a bulletproof superduty basic communication device.

For the price, it performs all of the functions a phone needs to (texting, calling) and that was really all I needed it for. I did not install any additional apps onto it.The battery does last all day but ONLY if your usage is very light.The response time is incredibly slow and the screen is poorly calibrated. When tapping something, it registers the wrong thing and takes another several seconds to back out of it. Thus, I would NOT recommend this phone for a child if you want your child to have something reliable in emergencies.Typing also takes a while. If you use your phone to clock into work like I do, expect this process to take up to five minutes.The camera button on the side is OK in theory but it doesn't take much for the button to be pressed. I'll brush against it and the phone will turn on to open the camera (and this process takes nearly a minute).Unsure why it asked to rate face recognition or fingerprint reader as this phone does not have either.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ryis', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Mediocre. Better alternatives', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2023', 'Review Body': ""As a Handset Enthusiast, I find hard to hold the BLU G33 in high regard. The hard-specs are lacking, with only 2GB of RAM, the BLU G33 is going to be slow & incompetent at performing multiple tasks at once. The 16GB of Storage is tolerable, but due to the inability to format Micro SD Cards as internal storage, you're restricted on how many apps you can have on the G33. The Outward Camera & Inward Camera are capable of taking comprehendable photos, but they are certainly low quality & grainy in resolution. The Software is modern by 2023 Standards, running Android 13 Go Edition, one can expect a clean interface, albeit choppy & slow. The IPS LCD display/screen is clear, with very acceptable viewing angles, but don't expect it to be crisp & high quality.BLU has always done a good job including accessories with their unlocked handset devices, the G33 does not disappoint. The clear TPU case is sufficient & charging equipment are included unlike modern big label phone manufacturers. Although not mentioned, the G33 comes with a pre-installed Screen Protector, albeit a cheap plastic film instead of the tempered glass ones they include with their high price models.The G33 is a usable phone & built quite nicely, solid in the hands with nice heft. Yet unfortunately, due to it's internal hardware, using this device will require patience as it is slow in almost every aspect. If you MUST have a phone/handset cheaper than $100 USD with modern features such as Type-C charging & Android 13, this can be the device for you. But there are better options for your money if you are willing to use an older version of Android & Micro-USB charging. Even BLU themselves makes better alternatives to the G33, if you are willing to pay $20-$30 USD more, you can acquire the BLU G61S or BLU S91 which are slightly older but better performing handsets. The compromise with these phones is the fact they run Android 11 & will not be supported in terms of software updates, therefore may feel less modern.In the end, the G33 is a modern but slow phone, it is usable with patience, performing basic smartphone features. There are just some better options if you are willing to spend slightly more for a more enjoyable user experience.Edit: Spelling Typos.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rubeneast', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""It works so well it's the best cell phone that I ever had."", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Nothing it works perfect at all times\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Fatimadlc', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'STOP WORKING!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Phone is not loading, stop working, i thought was a battery problem but not it simply doesn't start. bad quality phone\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Greatness', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Terribel product, only worked for one day!

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I\'m happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they\'re not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I\'m committed to the new phone, don\'t want to lose it, but don\'t want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I\'ll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don\'t run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it\'s all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here\'s the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it\'s good, we\'ll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I\'m no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Eric Sullivan', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Too easy…', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024', 'Review Body': 'On my journey of ordering a refurbished iPhone and it can be a journey this was an excellent purchase.  Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Joshua A.

After reviewing my choices in lower cost phones, I decided to buy this renewed Samsung A32 5G.  I\'m not going to go into a lot of detail about the features on this phone because you can find video reviews on YouTube for that.  I\'ll say that at this price level you will be hard pressed to find a phone with so many features, especially one that is just two years old.  Oddly enough, the 4G version of this phone (simply called the A32) has lenses with a higher resolution that this one, but I think 48MP resolution is pretty good, and a definite improvement over my previous phone.  The fingerprint scanner built into the side button is a nice way of unlocking your phone.  I requested a phone that was in ""excellent"" condition, and that was what I got, with absolutely no visible marks or damage to either the case or the screen.  I use T-Mobile (prepaid) for my carrier, and I was able to take the SIM card out of my old phone and put it into this one and use the phone right away without any issues.  I am very happy with this phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Elsy Angélica', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Mexico on April 23, 2023', 'Review Body': 'Excelente teléfono, cuando lo compre no sabía que era un producto reparado por la marca, llegó sin empaque y con un cargador que no correspondía a ka marca y además usado.

I took it to Europe and back, dropped it a gazillion times, the back battery is exposed in one corner, and yet it still works today.My second and third phone where Moto G Power 2020 and 2021. They are just too heavy. I drop one face first, cracked the screen too hard that I can\'t safely touch it. The other one is still working today but stutters like crazy.My forth phone is Moto G Pure. This phone is pure garbage. Once I synced up all my apps it runs slower than a PS2. Absolute trash of a phone that should have not been release.That brings me up to this phone, the G14. I\'ve owned it for 2 days, transferred all my apps, so far so good.The key points that make this a good purchase,1. It is $130 bucks. If you buy an iPhone or flagship android, you are easily spending 10 times this amount. Now with your $1000 phone, you got to add a case to protect it, maybe you add a screen protector too. Now your phone is 2 milimeters thicker, which probably makes it bigger than this phone.2. It looks like a shanzhaied iPhone 11. Shan Zhai means mountain fortress which just sounds very cool. If people ask you what phone it is, you can say it is motorola and they will go oh, I haven\'t heard that names in years.3. It\'s got 2 Sim slots and a SD card slot. You heard that right, you can combine 2 numbers and add gigabytes of storage into this baby.4. If you shop online with this phone, the seller will data mine your phone and give you better prices because it thinks you are poor.5. It is MOTOROLA.

They want me to pick another (more expensive) ""Flex"" plan.  I believe this is the case for any phone i switch to, not just because this is a special ""dumb"" phone.As for the phone itself?  Awesome.  If you are looking for a phone straight out of 2005 that you can use on today\'s networks, this one is it.  It doesn\'t lag.  It not some Kai-os sudo-android interface running on slow hardware causing lagging and crashing.  It\'s a true dumb phone.  The software feels like a true dumb phone.  But it also has a few tricks up it\'s sleeve:- Bluetooth- Dual Sims- Calculator- Flashlight- Micro-SD card slot- Something like 32mb of onboard storage- Plays Mp3\'s.  They can play in the background, so you can have music going while texting someone.  Yes, this WORKS WITH BLUETOOTH headphones or your car, and yes, it actually sounds good.  Play them off the tiny internal memory or a Micro-SD card.  You can also plug the USB cable it comes with from the phone to your computer and access both the Micro-SD card slot and the phone\'s internal memory as separate drives.  So you don\'t need a Micro-SD card reader on your computer.- FM Radio (doesn\'t work with bluetooth headphones for some reason, but you can play it through the speakerphone)- Upload your own ringtones and notification sounds.  You can store them on the Micro-SD card or the internal memory.- Camera.  It\'s garbage.  Even by early 2000\'s standards its garbage.  But it does exist, you can send and receive pictures, store them internally, upload them to your computer through USB, etc.  I don\'t plan on using it, but if my wife wants to send me a picture of something, at least i can see it.  You kind of need a camera phone to do that with.  Non-camera dumb phones typically don\'t receive pictures of have screens capable of rendering pictures.  This one will do it.It is a little big and cheap feeling, but I don\'t think dropping it will break it.  It has kind of that ""jitterbug"" old people phone aesthetic more in real life than in the pictures.  But as a millennial who\'s first cellphone was a Kyocera K7 Rave running on Virgin Mobile for 25 cents per minute, this phone has my approval as an official dumb-phone if you\'re trying to take your life back from phone addiction.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Customer', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Terrible product.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This phone is not very good. It appears to be charging correctly when I plug it in. However as soon as I unplug it, the screen goes black. It doesn’t turn on, it doesn’t show a low battery warning, it basically bricks it. Rendering It a completely useless device and waste of money. I had the phone plugged in consecutively for about 24 hours. No sign of  “life” in the phone in the slightest bit. Originally purchased because I want a phone without internet. As well as not having to worry about it breaking easily as the pictures made the phone look pretty durable with the shell essentially  being a built in phone case. The size is what I was looking for. It’s a nice design for a compact phone. Nothing too fancy nothing too small.

The phone is just what I wanted, no browser. The texting is t9 but it works. The hardest part is it doesn\'t capitalize the ""I"" when typing, but you can change the format for that word and then change it back. Small annoyance. The phone itself doesn\'t feel very durable so we\'ll see how it performs when the inevitable drop happens, but the case seems like it will be waterproof as it does have a really tight seal.

The only reason the picture of the dog is so big is because I photographed it by pushing my camera in to that screen, but the text on the dog hands was not really not readable on this phone. It would be nice to have the option to zoom in, but I guess that would make it a smartphone ;)I'm happy, and so is my son.  Thank you for creating a phone that's good for families. :-)P.s.

You can call, text, and listen to music via the FM radio or by loading an SD card with MP3s. And there’s even a 3.5 jack to play wired headphones. Playing the radio or MP3s ate up the battery quickly, so I didn’t use it, but I tested it for the team. :-).One feature I constantly use is the cool flashlight. This is a dedicated flashlight, not just a backlight screen masquerading as a flashlight. It is a bright LED, and being on the top of the phone, it points very naturally.At 115g, the phone fits in any pocket.The AGM has two SIM slots, which are ideal for travelling. The battery is removable and easily swapped. Spare batteries cost less than $20, and replacing the battery takes less than five minutes. The phone is loud, the LED screen bright, and the buttons large with a tactile click.I live in an area with poor cell reception, and the AGM works well making and receiving calls. Texting is possible with the numerical keypad.There’s a calendar, calculator, and camera—all basic but all working.A fast charger and a USB C cable are included in the box, and the manual is easy for even a boomer like me to understand! :-)A basic phone has much to recommend it. They are very affordable and less prone to damage than a smartphone. The AGM can go three days between charges, and an old battery doesn’t require expensive service work to be fixed. A basic phone also carries less personal and financial data than most smartphones.With an IP68 rating, it is waterproof and dustproof, so makes a perfect work phone.In conclusion, the AGM M9 is a rugged phone with easy-to-use features.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on September 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The best basic phone ever.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 8, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Good product with large buttons, speaker volume and simple menu options with rugged construction.

The slightly opalized, matte-finish of the back of the phone is just beautifully done. The camera optics are not expensive, so it won't be as good as an iPhone, but they're not terrible either - certainly well-worth the price point. The camera software is really nice with lots of modes and options including a night mode and a pro mode. Not too shabby!Features I like: I LOVE that this came with a screen protector already installed - thank you! I also love that it came with a nice silicone case.Bottom line - Altogether, this phone is a truly outstanding value for the <$100 asking price.

I can go all weekend without charging it, and folks over 40 always seem super curious about it. Their top question? “Do you have to use T-9 or re-learn it? I couldn’t handle that!” But nah, it's still a touchscreen with Android, and the text-to-speech feature is pretty handy.

Si questo perché non solo è praticamente super protetto e resistente a qualsiasi interperia ma è alquanto potente , infatti convince non solo nel design ma anche nell’hardware e nel software, insomma un buon compromesso tra potenza e prestazione.All\'interno della confezione troviamo:1- Lo smartphone con pellicola protettiva già applicata1- Alimentatore1- Cavo di ricarica/trasmissione dati type-c1- Estrattore sim1- garanzia e libretto d\'istruzioneUn prodotto con prezzo di fascia media ma con prestazioni premium adatto non solo a chi cerca uno smartphone indistruttibile e ben protetto ma anche\xa0 a chi cerca un dispositivo di qualità e di sostanza , infatti convince nell’hardware, nel software e anche nel design , tanto è vero che\xa0 esteticamente è molto bello , ben protetto in tutti i lati , una beckcover in policarbonato leggermente ruvido in modo che non c\'è rischio che lo smartphone possa scivolare dalle mani in caso fossero sudate o bagnate , inoltre\xa0 è ben assemblato oltre ad essere super protetto in tutti e 4 lati , infatti è resistente all\'acqua ,\xa0 resistente sia a basse temperature che ad alte temperature,\xa0 resistente agli urti , resistente alla polvere e resistente alle cadute accidentali,\xa0 questa scelta ha fatto sì che lo smartphone risultasse abbastanza pesante\xa0 in mano , ma comunque è un peso accettabile \xa0considerando che si tratta appunto di un rugged phone e tenendo in considerazione anche le dimensioni del display e della batteria oltre che il rivestimento protettivo.Per quanto riguarda il display monta un HD+ da 6,52 pollici in grado di restituire immagini vivide , buon bilanciamento cromatico ed è utilizzabile senza problemi anche sotto la luce diretta del sole. Nessun problema anche per quanto riguarda la visuale laterale ( su più fronti) , nessun riflesso , nessun effetto "" sbiadito""\xa0, i colori restano vividi e la visuale del display resta chiara e ben visibile. Inoltre ha\xa0 anche un trattamento oleofobico eccezionale , nel senso che non trattiene le impronte sul display , una caratteristica da non dare per scontata. Inoltre sono presenti anche diverse modalità di sblocco , oltre a quelle tradizionali,\xa0 vi è anche lo sblocco tramite riconoscimento facciale , che funziona una meraviglia,\xa0 in quanto la fotocamera frontale da 5 megapixel permette uno sblocco veloce e reattivo , per cui davvero molto funzionale , inoltre nel comparto fotografico vi è anche il sensore per lo sblocco tramite impronte digitali, anch\'esso molto funzionale e soprattutto reattivo.Per quanto riguarda il lato reparto imaging,\xa0 monta una fotocamera principale da 48 megapixel ad alta risoluzione\xa0 , che è una garanzia sia in condizioni di buona luce , sia quando l’illuminazione diventa critica. Un aiuto lo offre anche la stabilizzazione ottica dell’immagine, preziosa negli scatti notturni. Ho effettuato diversi scatti,\xa0 e vi assicuro che la fotocamera principale cattura tanta luce , restituendo così foto naturali , dettagliate e assolutamente non plasticose , mentre la fotocamera frontale è\xa0da 5 megapixel con che assicura buoni selfie il tutto ottimizzato dall\'ottimo AI integrato. I video vengono registrati ad alta risoluzione , garantendo un\'ottima qualità così come la stabilizzazione, ottima anche la velocità di messa a fuoco.Ma il punto forte dello smartphone è il processore,\xa0 infatti monta il T606 Octa Core con una frequenza di 2.3GHz con GPU integrata\xa0 , che permette di rendere lo smartphone veloce e mai titubante infatti il potente processore permette un rendering grafico rapidissimo e fluidissimo , il tutto ottimizzato dai 6 GB di memoria RAM e dai 256 GB di memoria interna ( espandibile tramite SDcard fino a 1T). Inoltre la GPU integrata rende lo smartphone ottimo anche per il gaming , comportandosi egregiamente anche con titoli di spessore che richiedono un framerate alto e stabile , non si può chiedere di più.Dedico qualche riga alla memoria RAM, viene indicato 24 GB di RAM , in effetti è così, questo perché 6GB sono installati direttamente sulla soc con la possibilità di aumentare la ram installata con ulteriori 18 GB di RAM virtuale, per un totale di 24 GB di RAM, operazione che consiglio vivamente , sarà poi il processore a regolare l\'utilizzo della RAM in base alle esigenze dello smartphone.Buona anche l’autonomia che con una batteria da 10600mAh permette di utilizzare per molto tempo lo smartphone anche con un uso intenso , personalmente lo ricarico una volta ogni 3 giorni , semplicemente perché lo utilizzo spesso e in modo intenso. Mentre se viene utilizzato in modo moderato l\'autonomia aumenta fino a 4 giorni senza essere ricaricato.Per quanto riguarda la connettività , troviamo\xa0il real dual sim ( due sim più micro sd) , 4g plus e LTE ,\xa0\xa0\xa0 Wifi , GPS, NFC\xa0 Bluetooth , OTG\xa0e slot per microSD card fino a 1T.Infine,\xa0 per quanto riguarda il software,\xa0 è installata la versione di Android 14 con patch di sicurezza aggiornate ( e che vi chiederà di aggiornare alla prima accensione) inoltre poiché lo smartphone è\xa0 nuovo alla prima accensione vi chiederà diversi aggiornamenti da fare , infine\xa0 per quanto riguarda l\'interfaccia utente,\xa0 resta intuitivo e user friendly.\xa0In conclusione penso che sia uno degli Smartphone più prestanti ed eccellenti nella fascia rugged medio-bassa\xa0 , in quanto vi è un\xa0ottimo equilibrio tra potenza e prestazione.Spero di esservi stato utile. 👋\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Gorka', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on October 7, 2024', 'Review Body': 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\nEl resultado de este Móvil rugerizado es bastante bueno , tiene una batería de muy larga duración , sobrado de RAM y rom y con reconocimiento facial , está preparado para mover cualquier aplicación por pesada que sea ya que tiene muy buenas prestaciones , va muy fluido y suena genial , este tipo de movil soporta muy bien los golpes y el agua , la pantalla se ve genial y es de muy buen tamaño de imagen para ver cualquier plataforma de streaming sin problema , me gusta mucho el chasis y los botones , que vienen muy bien protegidos .la memoria de 256gb no es fisica , sería de 12 GB así que hay que activar una opción para disfrutar de los 256gb de espacio virtual  , lleva android 14 que funciona realmente bien en este modelo , en definitiva el punto fuerte de este tipo de móviles es su batería que es eterna y el buen resultado que da para golpes y salpicaduras , eso sí  para hacerlo tan robusto le penalizaun poco  el peso aunque en pocos días te acostumbras .\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Oli', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on August 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Es ist schon krass wie wenig Geld man ausgeben muss um ein Top Handy zu erhalten, dass sich hinter den iPhones nicht verstecken muss.

Text messaging, switching back and forth between apps is really smooth with the 120hrz display. It's running a near stock version of android 14. There's no skin like some Redmi phones.  You might experience a hiccup or two here and there but that's not a deal breaker at all. Very slim, lightweight phone that fits perfectly in my pocket with my other phone. The camera and speaker are probably the only downfall to this phone. The speaker isn't that loud and lacks base. The camera isn't to bad if you're in decent lighting and using the main 64 megapixel camera. not bad but I've definitely seen better.  I'm using this phone on mint mobile. I have no problems with getting notifications text messages and RCS chats work I get 5G connectivity with speeds over 50mb per second.

My last phone was a BLU F91 5G, which if it was still available I would have just bought another.  I can\'t reconcile mentally why there is no wireless charging.  Seriously, all the reasonably priced options don\'t have it any longer.  The only reason I ""upgraded"" was because the battery in my old phone got hot enough to off gas and blow the back of the case off on my old phone so I did not have a ton of time to wait around looking for a new phone.I have been using this phone for a week and here are all the things I have noticed so far.1. It does have a dual sim card slot, but an odd one.  Its on the bottom of the phone, and very difficult to get out even with the tool they provided, it took a bit of a hook to get it out.  Its thicker than usual and the sim card kind of snaps in, because its double sided.  You put one card facing out on the top and bottom, new to me after having dozens of phones.  Nowhere could I find if it was dual sim in the documentation (Sim1 is on top).2. Its big enough storage to justify not having an SD card slot.  I know nobody is doing it these days, but I have had more phones die than SD cards and a good waterproof SD card can save the day if you have a whole trips worth of pictures on the phone when you dunk it hard enough to kill the phone.  But, with 256GB its got enough storage for all my MP3\'s and lots of pictures (I travel a lot and am on the water often where I have no service but want to be able to have music on board) plus all my apps.  There was a bunch of unnecessary bloatware but not terrible and it was easy to clean up.  I am at 41% used before I start taking pictures so its a bit dicey for long term usage.3. The onboard storage is slow.  Unbearably slow.  Transferring my files from my Windows or Unix PC was maddeningly slow, regardless of USB cable or which port I used.  These are the same devices and cables I use for my old phone as well as an even older BLU G91 Pro and they are both 100 times faster to copy files over USB either to the SD card or the internal storage.  It was so slow and unusable that I had to try multiple cables and ports before giving up on moving my MP3\'s over by USB and installing an FTP client on my phone.  That was the only way I could move anything more than a few small files on or off the phone.  Its something that I can overcome but its maddening.4. It came with a screen protector on it.  Its good because there are not a lot of options yet, but I didn\'t see that anywhere.5. The case it comes with is laughable and there are not many options currently and you never know if there ever will be.  Honestly for this to be in the Bold line and not have a better case than this is a bit odd.  My last 2 phones had the black lightly armored cases that were good enough not to need an upgrade, this one is going back a few years and its a throw away if you can find something better.  The first one I have tried doesn\'t even come close to having the right openings for this phone even if it fits the general form factor and camera lens so if you need a decent case maybe this is not the right phone for you.6. The fingerprint scanner is adequate but not great.  Its in the screen which is the new hottness, but it doesn\'t work as well as my last several low end phones.  I have 7 or 8 fingerprints registered to try and help my two fingers work but I have to hold it just right to get it to unlock.  It works and I am getting used to it but the back panel and power button scanners both work better for me.7. Battery life is fantastic and it charges well.  It does take a bit more power to do a fast charge but it is very fast and the battery easily lasts me all day.  No complaints at all, other than damn I wish it had wireless charging, I mean its 2024 and many, many cars have wireless charging and it would be great to be able to use it. I know it adds heat and I wouldn\'t really use it in the summer and its not that fast but if you are driving its nice to just keep it topped off if you don\'t want to deal with wires.8. The screen is just lovely.  I really should have lead with this.  its the nicest looking screen I have every used, and its very bright and very clear.  It is so easy to read I might be in the market for a second one because my wife\'s phone screen is terrible compared to this one.9. Its fast enough most of the time.  Fastest phone I have ever had, very responsive nearly all the time.  The ram is plenty for an old dude who has way to much open and way to many notifications all the time. The only thing slow so far is the camera, and I wonder if its because the storage is slow.  That sucks for me, I have missed several candid shots already and experience has told me this is as fast as the phone will get. I am going to have to slow down myself and see if lowering the resolution will help but as of now the shutter speed is slow enough I have taken several pictures of my feet.  I have only taken few a dozen pictures and a couple videos, and while they look really really good on the screen I haven\'t tried them on a big screen yet.  The camera would also benefit from some form of stabilization but it works well enough for the price point from a quality standpoint.Overall its a good phone, I wish it had a decent case, and faster camera and storage.  It wouldn\'t hurt to have an SD card slot.  It still sucks to not have wireless charging.  I hope BLU brings that one back.  Its a great phone to look at and feels good in my hand and for the price its very good.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'tien phan', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very nice phone but two problems', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This is a very nice phone in quality, screen Super AMOLED.

Here's the review with a bullet-point summary of each critique added at the end:---The Blu Bold K10 phone has proven to be a solid choice for my needs, earning a commendable 4-star rating from me.This phone offers 4G connectivity, ensuring reliable and fast internet access. One of the standout features is its beautiful display, which provides vibrant and sharp visuals. The inclusion of a screen protector and case cover is a thoughtful addition, offering immediate protection right out of the box. Priced at just $99.00, the Bold K10 delivers impressive value for money.The phone boasts a generous 128GB of storage, with the option to expand it by an additional 128GB using the dual SIM and memory tray. This flexibility is particularly useful for managing both personal and professional communications.However, the phone does have a few drawbacks. The absence of NFC means no Google Wallet support for tap purchases, and the phone can sometimes take a long time to boot up. Additionally, it only offers 16 setting features compared to the 26 on my old phone, and the resolution and screen alignment can be off-center when switching between portrait and landscape modes. The volume isn't as high as desired, and hacks to increase it are suppressed.Despite these minor issues, the Blu Bold K10 meets my current needs effectively. I'm comfortable using this phone until I decide to upgrade to a more fully featured model. Overall, the Bold K10 is a reliable and cost-effective option that I would recommend to those looking for a budget-friendly smartphone with ample storage and a beautiful display.Critique Summary:- Sometimes takes a long time to boot up.- No NFC feature, so no Google Wallet/tap purchases.- Only 16 setting features compared to 26 on my old phone. The Motorola 5G Stylus is a lackluster phone  and in many ways the Blu Bold K10vhas several superior features.- Resolution and screen alignment issues in portrait vs. landscape mode.- Volume is not great and cannot be increased due to suppression of hacks.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Geoff Tate', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Won't connect to 4g network"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It won't connect to 4 g network and the battery life is rubbish\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Raildig', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Very Poor Battery Life, Glitches, Nasty Sound', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I recently bought a pair of the BLU View 5 phones for use as Wi-Fi devices around the house instead of cheap tablets, and have been very surprised at how good they are for the price.

I bought a defective phone from you which was supposed to be a new phone but I can not use it. First, it would not charge for two days the first week I got. I tried all the chargers in the house, and it would not charge. The next morning, the battery finally died. I had planned to buy another phone but decided to try charging it again then it came on so I thought the problem was over. When I traveled, I did not use it for 6 days because there was no WIFI, so I  have barely used this phone that is now stuck with me.The next thing I experienced on Sunday was no connectivity. There was no reception almost all day on Sunday, and today, I am having the same issue.I tried to print out a return label on Sunday  as soon as I came home, but there was only one place on your website to drop it off. There was an option to choose my own drop off location, but each time I typed the locations in the space provided, it would not go through so I was stuck with your drop off location choice which was Georgia Tech, an hour away from me. On Monday morning, when I  went back online to  try again, the return space was closed. Why was the last day of return the 21st instead of the 22nd? Why would you set it up like you have only to have one location available and nothing else? Is it to make me get stuck with the phone? Well, you have succeeded. What if I lived in Augusta, Georgia, how was I supposed to drop it off at Georgia Tech?The reason why I bought this phone was because it was unlocked so I could use it when I traveled out of the country. My trip was from April 6 - 21. So I had little to no chance of returning this phone because you have only one drop off location on your site. Now, I am stuck with it and can not use it because it is defective, and I have to buy another phone.

The user interface tries to do too many things: take pictures, videos, do text messages, check voice mail, check missed calls . . . Seniors need a phone that does one thing GREAT (make phone calls) and move everything else to the back burner, still available, but buried away in the menus for savy Seniors who feel like exploring bonus features.  There are so many things they could have done to make phone calling easier.  This is actually better than other flip phones, but not as much as hoped for.  I\'d suggest they make the call menu top priority for the phone, scroll down and have the contact names right there, then press okay and it immediately calls that contact.  To do anything else should require navigating through the MENU which could be at the top, right above all the contact names.  Easy, problem solved, and many more aging seniors would be able to use it.----EDIT---- My mother is constantly accidentally turning the volume down (pressing the buttons on the side) and then saying things like  ""I can\'t hear you I can\'t hear you I can\'t hear you"" and has difficulty figuring out she needs to turn the volume back up.  subtracting another star.  surprisingly difficult for her to use this phone---REEDIT -- this is an AWFUL PHONE, Mom and I can\'t figure out how to adjust the ringer volumn up, I tried to talk to her on another phone telling her which button to press, the volumn button on the side that the manual clearly specifies, didn\'t work, she actually got it to drop down to silent.  0 stars now, if can\'t figure it out will have to cancel---Re-REedit 3rd time --  Mom still can\'t figure out how to adjust the ringer volume.  It arbitrarily gets set to Ringer-OFF (I suspect from hitting the side buttons by accident) then the phone does\'t ring and she doesn\'t answer it, and when she tries to adjust the volumn while I\'m on the phone with her, when I tell her how, she adjusts the Conversation-Volume.  The folks at Jitterbug need to get a phone design that\'s not prone to senior citizens accidently pressing the ringer volume to OFF.  It\'s more than a head-ache, it causes her to NOT HEAR THE PHONE RING.  sure, young folks can figure out what\'s going on, and try not to do it again, but elderly seniors don\'t learn from past mistakes and cant figure things out easily.

The hardware is almost exactly the same except for some different wording on the buttons.  The software is also similar, except for placing a call.  Unless you set up one touch dialing, the number of steps to just call a contact has increased vs the first generation phone.  For a savvy user this is not a problem.  For an elderly person that is not that into technology, that’s a problem.  I don’t understand why they would make this most basic operation more complicated for a product specifically tailored to an elderly audience; this is supposed to be their area of expertise.

It’s hard to set up and the results leave something to be desired.First you have to link your Lively and Amazon accounts which is understandable, but then you have to add the Lively ‘skill’ to Alexa on this device.The big disappointment is that even after jumping through the hoops to successfully set it up you can’t say, “Alexa, call Tommy.”  You have to say, “Alexa, ask Lively to call Tommy.”  My father in law is having the darnedest time remembering that or even pronouncing the new words for him “Alexa”, “ask”, and “Lively.” You can’t deviate, you have to nail it! Apparently he never uses the word ask it’s always tell, and Alexa was an obscure name in 1945 but Alexis was fairly popular!If we could get it to call me when he says, “Alexis, call Tommy” or even, “Alexis, tell your buddy to call Tommy” that would be great.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M.Martin', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Perfect for my granddaughter', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Flip phone is safer for young teens and the price was much cheaper on Amazon; the company actually told me this.

The speakers aren’t the best and when you’re holding it your fingers usually cover it up anyway but it still sounds decent.Overall I think this phone is well worth the price listed, don’t expect it to be better than an iPhone in terms of camera quality or performance but it’s so cheap it should be expected to be better than an iPhone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Ryan keller', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Rugged waterproof phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I'm a clutz and am hard on phones,  I've been using it for a week now and I'm really excited ,It's really good value for money device, it's got a great looking screen and then it's all beautifully presented overall, it runs fast and doesn't lag, the battery is very long lasting and latest version of Android 14, It's also face unlocked, so convenient.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'billy donnnelly', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Easy to operate mobile phones with large batteries', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I bought this for my dad and he is loving it. he likes that the volume is very high so that he doesn't miss any notification.

It would connect for a little bit, the won\'t receive signal. It will keep you connected to wifi, but will act as if you have no internet. I keep my wifi off for best data performance, which is great for me. For those looking to stay connected to wifi, this may be a deal breaker. I\'ve looked on Reddit and this seems to be an issue with the 8 series. Hopefully it gets patched, but considering it\'s been over 6 months, it\'s unlikely.I left Android for iPhone about 5 years ago, and I always missed the freedom Android gave me. The ""major"" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that\'s a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (""chugged"" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).I won\'t explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won\'t let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn\'t notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to ""pass the aux cord"" XD.The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it\'s primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can\'t compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you\'ll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you\'ll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn\'t matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn\'t use it, anyway.Tl;dr:If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'GBustin', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Everything about it is amazing.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024', 'Review Body': '2nd UPDATE on 8/7/2024:Somebody asked if the Redmagic 9S Pro was compatible for Bend Oregon? To begin with, I have a 8S pro, the model before. I have not heard of ANY incompatibility issues. I have T-mobile and it works perfectly. It has a double sim tray and I could have 2 phone numbers on it if I wanted. I still don\'t game, but I use it extensively to watch videos and run my Powerpoint presentations (in Google Slides). Everything runs perfectly, and extremely fast, never a gliche. I know my phone is over-powered for what I do, but it\'s like owning a Lamborghini to run everyday errands. And the battery is the best thing. I still charge my phone every 3 days, and I use it a lot. I also use my standard 3.5mm phone jack a lot too and would have gotten it for that one thing. The antenna is great, never a gliche using google maps. It is just an awesome phone. I worried that it\'s 6.8"" size might be too big, but with a slim case, the thin phone fits easily in the front pockets of my jeans. I assume the 9S pro is the same or better.UPDATE ON 3/24/2024:This phone is amazing for what I need. Most amazing is the 6 amp hour battery that never seems to run out. I used to charge my old phone every day, sometimes twice a day. I charge the new redmagic phone every 3 days (still at 20%), and it only takes 18 minutes to fully charge! That one thing alone makes it worth the  money. It is extremely fast for video & powerpoint files, and the usb3.2 jack allows me to connect to my PC and easily and quickly move big files back and forth. You don\'t need to play games to make good use of an extremely powerful phone.INITIAL REVIEW:First I\'m not a gamer, but I need a powerful phone with big screen, USB3.0 or better data transfer and most of all, a 3.5mm headphone jack! This has it all. It has an awesome big screen with graphics subprocessor system that makes it extremely fast, which wasn\'t absolutely necessary, but it plays my powerpoint files breathtakingly fast. The USB 3.2 connector connects easily to my PC because it is important for me to transfer large data files to and from the phone. It works great. It has 12GB ram and 256GB rom, the minimum for this phone. That is more than I need but you can upgrade to much more memory and storage. I use the 3.5mm headphone jack nearly every day to play music and videos, and absolutely would not have a phone without one. The BATTERY is a monster. It has two 3,000 mah batters totaling 6,000 mah. What that means is the way I use it, I only have to charge it every 3 days! And after I run it down below 20%, it recharges all the way to full in about 15 minutes. Amazing. I had heard that the camera wasn\'t the best, but it is plenty good for me. It has Sony lenses and takes great photos and videos, in high resolution if you want, and even has a pro mode for mini picture adjustments that I will never do. And it costs literally half what a flagship samsung or iphone cost, half. I cannot comment on games which this phone was designed for, because I don\'t play games. The simple cheap case I bought for it looks sleek and great. The only possible negative is that it\'s heavy, because of the huge battery that lasts forever. SUMMARIZING: this is one awesome phone that any older non-gamer will be thrilled to own. BTW, I am a simple consumer, I don\'t work in the tech field.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mcfire', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Best upgrade', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Had the Red Magic 5G for 4 years, so I was due for an update.

It\'s a second phone for me, used for when I sell items online, as I didn\'t want to invest in a more expensive phone for that reason.  I use it on Tracfone\'s prepaid service and it works fine with their sim card.  The A52 is considered ""mid-range"", and you should NOT compare it to a $1,000+ iPhone or similarly priced Samsung phone.  At full price it\'s $499, but occasionally goes on sale for $399, and at that price, is an excellent deal.It boots up quickly enough.  The under-screen fingerprint reader is not as reliable or as fast as a dedicated physical fingerprint reader button, but so long as you take the time to properly program a couple of fingers into it, it works well enough.  The 1080p screen is bright and clear, and just large enough to give you plenty of viewing space and still be able to comfortably hold it, without being overwhelmingly large.  The speakers are decent.  Battery life is pretty good and should get you through a whole day unless you literally live on the phone.  Call quality is ""ok"", and so far I\'ve only suffered from one dropped call.  The wifi antennae likewise, has good reception.Camera wise, it\'s again in the mid-range territory.  The main back camera does a very good job in good lighting, and a decent job in lower light. The wide-angle camera isn\'t quite as sharp/detailed and does less well in low light, but still more than good enough for online pics.  The maco lens is ok for quick close shots but not very high res and you have to keep your hands VERY steady to keep them sharp.  Front selfie cam is better than average but not top notch, and again, gets the job done.This is one of the better mid-range phones on the market in this price range, and if you can especially get it when it\'s on sale for $349-$399, then it\'s an EXCELLENT deal for what you get for the price.  Once again, it\'s not a $1,000+ phone and if you compare it to one of those exactly, you might be a little disappointed, but if you compare it to others in this price range, it\'s a good pick.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'John Galt 2021', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'As A Renewed Galaxy Excellent Value For the Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Updated for Battery1 Capacity - It appears to have come with about 95% of new A52 5G battery capacity.2 Charging - Using the charging brick and cable that came in the box it takes about an hour to charge from 25% to 85%.  Using the Samung 4.0 battery saving feature I have the phone set at 85%  maximum chargeNote: I have the cable plugged into a UPS and not directly into the electrical outlet in the wall.  Charging might be faster if charging directly from an electrical outlet.3 Discharging - Maybe six or so hours of battery with continous video and audio streaming.  A full day\'s use of mixed use depending on how many hours you actually use apps on your phone.  Updating apps especially if you have a lot of them in addition to the Google and Samsung apps that come with the phone could use up to 5% of your battery charge during a single update session if you don\'t update daily.  Google app updates are big battery users.Overall the battery is okay.  Not great and not awful especially if you take the time to optimize your phone using Samsung\'s optimization features including Sleep and Deep Sleep.  I don\'t know how much the use of the phone app drains the phone as I am not a big phone talker so no point in checking.On a personal note.  I am not a big talker nor do I stream video or audio from my phone though I keep the phone on 24/7.  I am getting several days of use from a single charge to 85%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I received the phone on Saturday three days ahead of schedule.  Also received the case on Saturday, one day ahead of schdule.It was clear from the box the A52 5G came in that it was a renewed phone.  I didn\'t see any scratches on the display.  Since I keep the phone is a case like I have all my phones I didn\'t bother looking for scratches or marks on the back,  The seller has a 98% rating on AmazonAnyway.  I used Samsung\'s switch app to move all my stuff from my Tab A7 to the  A52 5G.  It took a while, a little over an hour.  Not all the apps moved over so I manually added the few that didn\'tThis morning the phone received Android 12 along with Samsung UI 4.0.  A definite improvement over Android 11 and UI 3.1.  One of the new features of UI 4.0 under Settings is a hardware test app.  Since the phione is renewed I was glad to see that.  I used it to check out all the hardware componentsm except facial recognition, which I am not using at the moment and they all checked out fine.Interesting, that all the Samsung apps on the phone udated from the Galaxy Store after 12.0 x 4.0 were completely installed.Now for a few comments about the A52 5GSo far no problem with my ISP accepting the phone.  Just switched the sim card and also the SSD card from my A12.  Both the phone and the card worked fine right after intalling them in the A52 5G.Not overwhelmingly fast or slow.  A nice speed for what I use a phone for.  I am not a gamer so I can\'t comment on that.The display while not great in the bright sun is more than readable outdoors in the bight sun.  The adaptive display feature works fine and doesn\'t dim the display too much in the dark.The audio without headphones or a bluetooth speaker while not the quality you get with those is loud enough without themI can\'t comment on the battery life at this time since I just got the phone along with an included fast charger brick and cable.  Charged it when I got it and again during the update to 12.0 x 4.0,  So in the less than three days that I have had the phone it has done heavy work on two of those days which obviously affects the battery drainage.As far as the  in display fingerprint scanner goes.  I knew before hand that it has gotten a lot of unfavorable reviews.  I am using it regulary even to open apps.  To wake the phone tap once to bring up the location of the scanner, then place your finger on that spot.  It works fine though it is a bitt slow.  You have to hold your finger on the scanner for a couple of seconds before it opens up whatever.I expect the battery will be fine since the phone is less than a year old and how many charges can one do in less than a year?  As the phones sytems softwarew learns and tunes itself and with some tweaks I imagine the battery life will be more than good enough.One last thing.  The A52 5G though it has the same display size 6.5"" as the A12 is lighter and narrower than the A12.  I have small hands and it is a comfortable fit.  I can\'t speak about one haned use since I have never used only one hand on any of my phones.  Hold the phone tight and secure from dropping it with my left and and operate it with my right hand.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Christopher Craven', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'DOES NOT WORK!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I received this phone and transfered the sim chip and all the data off my old phone and discovered in can't receive or make calls.

The sound quality has also been excellent, I mostly use Bluetooth headphones but occasionally play videos from the device and I have been pleased with the quality. The cameras take good quality photos, maybe not the best but good enough quality that I have not been disappointed and I love using the front screen with the cameras for taking photos, very nice feature.

They're garbage and take up battery, memory, and they probably get a ton of your personal data with these things just running in the background. Just terrible. But the phone is amazing. I love that the phone feels way smaller with it folded. It takes up less space on a desk and in your pocket. The front screen is great. Didn't ever care for things like that in the past, but it's awesome having it. The fingerprint sensor is lightning quick, but I'm not a fan of it being on the power button. Better than being on the screen but you have to like do a mental calculation of which finger to press the power button with. But the build quality and construction is top notch.

I\'ve got lots more apps I can use. The trouble is that the thing is WAY too sensitive. If you touch it, it comes on to tell you the time. Can\'t figure out how to make it stop doing that. If I carry it in my pocket I\'ll wind up with 5-10 apps opened up when I thought it was on standby. I had to put in my fingerprint to start up and now if my wife wants to answer the phone she has to come borrow my finger to get into the thing. If I\'m watching a video and the phone rings, I dare not miss the answer button or the phone goes away I don\'t know where. I admit it, I\'m 70 years old and millenial Chinese phone designers have no idea what is an intuitive operating system for someone like me. I anticipate a long long learning curve.  Also, the charger/PC port uses an odd size plug rather than the standard C plug my old phones, my camera and other stuff use and I can\'t find an adapter from their so I have to carry around the cord if I don\'t want to risk the phone dying and leaving me stranded without even an Uber call I can make. Woe is me if I lose that cord. I\'ll probably have to buy a dozen of them cause sure as the sun rises, I\'m going to lose several before it\'s all over. I\'m going to have to go full Bluetooth for headphones because after a week the headphone jack won\'t let me fully plug the phone jack in. I\'ll have to live with it\'s quirks. I can\'t afford to wait for it to be repaired. I don\'t want to set up another one (I spent a week figuring the thing out), and I need my phone. There are some things I\'m happy with. If I can just consistently answer a phone call without the thing losing the phone screen, I\'ll probably be okay.

Ich hatte es schon einmal interessant gefunden aber nicht gekauft, weil ich damals noch kabelgebundene Kopfhörer hatte und dieses Handy keinen Klinkenanschluss hat.Ich bin insgesamt zufrieden mit diesem Handy. Es hat ein paar Eigenheiten. Z. B. hat es eine vorinstallierte Radio App, die man weder deinstallieren noch deaktivieren kann. Da es aber keinen Klinkenanschluss gibt, kann man logischerweise keine kabelgebundenen Kopfhörer anschließen, um die Radio App zu nutzen. ^^Auch suspekt finde ich, dass das Handy einen krass lauten Lautsprecher aber keine vorinstallierte App zum Abspielen von Musik hat.Den linken Knopf finde ich cool. Man kann ihn selbst programmieren. Man kann ihn einmal kurz drücken, gedrückt halten und zweimal kurz drücken. Und für alle drei Optionen kann man eigene Funktionen verknüpfen. Entweder öffnet man damit eine App oder schaltet die Taschenlampe ein oder macht einen Screenshot. Das ist recht praktisch.Die Kamera ist ziemlicher Käse. Aber da das in meinem Fall ein Ersatzhandy ist, spielt das für mich keine Rolle. Wenn man ein Handy sucht um unterwegs schöne Fotos zu machen, ist dieses Handy die falsche Wahl.Das Handy ist echt groß. Ich habe sehr große Hände (Handschuhgröße 11/12) und es ist genauso groß, wie meine Handfläche. Und ziemlich schwer. Für kleine Hände und/oder Jogginghosen ist das also nichts.Vermutlich der Grund für das Gewicht: Der Akku hält echt lang.

Came from an S9', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022', 'Review Body': 'I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn\'t even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I\'m happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I\'m a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I\'ve watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I\'m not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don\'t recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I\'ve taken pictures of people and shown them, and they\'ve been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don\'t think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven\'t had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'M Mullins', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Love love love! Best phone I've ever had! Came from an A series phone!"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022', 'Review Body': ""My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'james gettle', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on August 5, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Like how easy to use.

I have to say, the battery is outrageously good. I\'m not sure why, but it compares like this. I always leave my phone in the kitchen when I go to bed. If I set my Z4 on the countertop with 100% battery at 8pm, and picked it up at 4am the next day, the battery would usually be at 80%, plus or minus. If I put the Moto G Power on the countertop at 8pm, and pick it up at 4am the next day, the battery is usually 95%, plus or minus.During the normal work day, I plug in my phone on the way to work and take it back to 100 %. If I left the Moto Z4 unplugged at the office with regular use (texts, email checks, no social media) the battery would be at 60% by 1pm and I would plug it in at work for about an hour or so to get it back to 85/100% before leaving for home. The Moto G Power, with the same usage at work, will be at 92% at 1pm, and I don\'t have to plug it in at all until I leave for home and plug it in in the truck.I have left the Moto G Power unplugged all day on a weekend and it barely goes under 90%. Maybe 85%, plus or minus. Could possibly be app related, but I don\'t know for sure. The only app I don\'t use on the new phone is the ""News"" app. Decided not to install it this time, but that\'s about it.Even took this phone to Cheap Trick/Blue Oyster Cult concert here in SoCal and left with battery around 79% after Snaps and Instagram posts during the concert. Usually concerts would kill my phone battery or at the very least take the battery to 20% plus or minus.Camera is okay. Not as sharp as the Moto Z4, and coloring could be better too, but it works. Selfies are great with the G Power as the lens is wider than the Z4.Everything else works great for a $200 plus or minus phone.

I'm sure it's probably not the fanciest phone, but it's super affordable and durable. Seriously, Moto phones are so crazy tough that they're actually better than Kyocera without actually trying. I bought two Kyoceras due to the built-in case design and durability. Strikes me as stupid to buy a fragile elegant sleek phone and then put in a huge clumsy brick. The first Kyocera was very good, probably not that impressive on the technology side, but well made with rubber padding. The second one was a completely cheaper piece of junk. Where the first was unbreakable the second screen cracked in a month. The only reason I stopped using the first one was because it's Bluetooth didn't work with the Fitbit that I bought. My first G7 power was one of my favorite phones. It wasn't supposed to be as tough as the first Kyocera, but it nearly was. Never used a case, sat on it dropped it on hard floors, carried tool bags full of tools on top of it, and it always worked. I actually caught the damned thing on fire trying to replace the battery and it still worked even though the old battery had shot a jet of flame out the side. Honestly I would still be using it, but the new battery isn't any better than the old. This is the 3 day battery and the new one is as useless as a wornout old battery. Makes me think it programmed obsolescence. Was working fine then it's only lasting a day. When newer the battery would go through a 12 hour shift and only be down 10-13% with Bluetooth on! Also it charged super fast, but I think that might have shortened the battery life.Anyway this one seems good although it's clumsy to operate. I guess someone had to reinvent the wheel. The old G7 just worked seamlessly this new one is already pissing me off trying to do simple things that didn't have to require thought.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dave', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good phone for the price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I had the Moto 2021 and the battery swelled, I tried to replace the battery and that didn't work so I had to buy another one and I really didn't want a new learning curve so I got the 2022 and it is a good phone.

I used 3 days without connecting to the charger. It allows me to no longer worry about charging issues frequently. It can last long time after one single charge.However, even with all the advantages, first of all, due to a large capacity of the charger, the overall weight of the phone is relatively heavy, which makes it inconvenient to hold by one hand for a long time. I need to switch hand or hold by 2 hands after a while.Overall, I've had a great experience with the phone, and pros clearly outweigh the cons.

I set up the phone and was getting used to it.  I received a check and used mobile deposit with my bank. Within 3 hours I was receiving calls about ""fraudulent"" charges on one of my cards.

You have to activate it with Lively, it cannot be used on any other service.It is large enough for most people to see the screen well.  It has a clear and simple menu, which can be adjusted as needed in the options. For a Senior who can learn, it will not take much effort to master the phone. Since it is an android, some features from google are available. An account from google will help transfer contacts to the phone. It is able to share location with other users of Google Maps without purchasing the Lively upgrade to track the phone location in a separate app. We are not using the advanced emergency response services from Lively yet but expect to in the future.For Seniors who cannot learn there are a couple of issues. It does not have a lift to wake feature, requiring the push button on the side to be pressed. This can be confusing for a person with some dementia to learn if they are transitioning from an Iphone to this phone.  Another issue is the contact list provided through Google contacts permits favorites which are displayed on the top of the list if you open contacts, or if you open the phone app, but not if you open texts. These minor differences may be hard to learn for someone without a memory. The solution is probably to delete all of the contacts except a few critical ones, and eliminate the favorites.  It is also possible to turn off the lock screen to make access simpler, but it will have no security at that point.We will see how it works, and I may update this review. At this point it appears to be the best option for a simple phone with actual features.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Vivian', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Worst buy of a lifetime', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022', 'Review Body': 'This is supposed to be easy to use.  Yes, there are many other bad reviews, but somehow I was hopeful and tried it anyway.  It\'s my third cell phone, and the only one that I may have to return or throw into the trash.

Then, somewhere in the instruction booklet, I found a second phone number, but that number gave the same result as the first one.  So I called their Customer Service.  That person managed, after about an hour, and with some difficulty, to connect me to a ""set-up specialist"" with whom I spent two or three hours on the phone.

I certainly didn't want to jump into the 1st few generations of a flip phone since I wasn't convinced about the folding screen quality and durability. But the tech is much better now and the folding screen isn't so hard to get used to.The specs say this phone is solid. Maybe just a half step down from a flagship phone. I thought that between the Samsung Galaxy flip 5 and this phone that my wife would opt for the Samsung as she's been using Samsung for the past 3 or 4 phones. I was surprised when she agreed to go with the razr.In terms of specs, the flip 5 has a slightly better processor but you can't tell a difference in real life. Same ram and memory for the same MSRP. The inside screen is comparable with the flip 5 being a little brighter but both are clear and sharp and offer a very nice viewing experience. You need to get used to the crease. Buying a flip phone, the crease in the screen is inevitable. When doing any surfing, I find my wife and I forget about the crease. In fact, she hasn't said a thing about it since the 1st day.The outside screen on the razr is hands down better. It allows better screen customization than the flip 5 and it's slightly bigger. It's also a higher resolution screen than the flip 5. I like how you can put almost any app on the small outside screen. You must use the stock keyboard for typing on the outer screen but that's fine. It's a full qwerty keyboard. Fat fingers will struggle but if you are petite like my wife, it's just fine. For anything quick like responding to a text, the phone stays closed and she responds on the outer screen. For anything more time consuming and intensive, flip it open and do your thing.My wife was getting tired of the big phone. The s21 ultra was big enough that she always had to think about which purse to take. Small purses weren't really options. That's why I thought I'd steer her towards a flip phone. It's so nice and compact and this magenta color is really sharp. Perfect for her. Today she went for a walk. No keys. Just her phone and earbuds. It was perfect cuz she had small shorts with small pockets and the phone fit with room to spare. Any other phone would have fallen out.I have thought about downsizing the phone myself. But really, if you can deal with the crease on the main screen, it's still a big screen at 6.9 inches and bigger than most of the modern phones. That's plenty big when you flip it open. But it folds so small that it fits nicely in your pocket. It's thicker than the current phones when folded up but thinner when open.Almost forgot to mention, when we were looking at the flip 5 and the razr, one thing I didn't like about the flip was how much the camera stuck out. The flip has squared sharp edges while the razr has rounded edges. So the razr is sleeker. The rounded edges of the razr let's it sit in the hands better than the squared off edges of the flip 5. Both have a power button fingerprint reader. I don't know how sensitive the flips reader is but the razr is really sensitive and fast.I know the reviews say the flip 5 camera takes better pictures. Maybe when you compare side by side but by no means does the razr take bad pictures. This is getting nitpicky. Sure, you are allowed to critique what you spend your money on but the reality is, the camera is just fine on the razr. I have not put it to the test. My upcoming vacation should allow me to see how good the camera is. I have no doubts my pixel camera will be better but it was better than the s21 ultra too (and just about any phone I've tested). Thus far, my wife hasn't said anything negative about the pictures she has taken. But we're not super duper picky.If you buy this phone fully understanding the limits of a flip phone and it's advantages and do not have unreal expectations, I think this phone is almost perfect. If I needed a new phone, I would definitely consider this one though I'd probably wait for the newest model due out mid year in 2024. I've always loved the razr line even dating back to the original flips Motorola used to make. Seeing that iconic name back in play with a new modern day phone has really perked my interest. I'm just really glad it has lived up to my expectations.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Dave', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Near perfect for what I was looking for', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024', 'Review Body': ""First you have to ask yourself if a flip phone is right for you?  Standard phones are optimized for a large battery size and a top notch camera, but not optimized for convenience of size when carrying/portability and when in use for basic phone functions.  Flip phones are optimized for convenience of size/portability.  But the form factor forces a compromise on battery size and  camera capability.  I put a priority on convenience/size, so a flip is a no-brainer IF it has the necessary functional capability.  The RAZR + does, with the inclusion of the external screen as it enables my most used functions without the need to open the phone.  I'm not the type who buries my head in my phone all day on social media/TikTok and/or games.  If I were, then a flip may not be optimal.Based upon the above analysis, the question then comes down to the razr+, or the Samsung flip 5, since they both have external screens.  The factors favoring the Samsung are that it has the more powerful Snapdragon Gen 2 vs. the Gen 1 in the Razr+.  Since I don't put high demands on the processor the Gen 1 in the Razr+ is more than adequate for me.  Another advantage it has is a marginally better camera, though neither is as capable as what can be had in a brick phone.  Again, this is not a high priority for me.  So this leaves one final advantage for the Samsung, and that is water resistance.  The Samsung is rated for surviving being submersed in water, where the razr+ is only rated to be splash resistant.  In all the years I've had a cellphone I've never dropped it in the toilet and don't plan to in the future (or any other body of water for that matter).  Though this is not a vital factor for me, if all else being equal, then it would be a deciding factor.  But all else is not equal.  For one thing, while the razr+ is not as robust against water damage, it is rated much higher against dust, which I understand to be important for flip phones.  But the key advantage for the razr+ is the external screen.  It as much higher resolution, and importantly, it is much easier to use a number of apps.  Thus, 80+% of the things I do with my phone I can do without the need to open my phone- text messaging, making/receiving phone call, assessing my wallet and the QR code I need to enter my gym, and any other QR codes for various tickets.  The Samsung external screen is much less capable and more complicated to use apps.  So, for my needs, the razr+ is the clear winner.  Another thing to note is that reviews often state the hinge on the razr+ seems less robust and does not inspire confidence as compared to the Samsung.  However, it seems very robust to me, and when compared to my son's Samsung Flip 4, I see no difference.  Though the Flip 5 may have an improved hinge compared to the flip 4, I dunno.  Since I can do most of what I need to without opening the phone, I would be putting less stress on the hinge compared to the Samsung any way.In short, I would say the the razr+ is optimized for flip phone advantages. While the Samsung seems to be trying to please both the flip market and the brick phone user.  As a result, it is sub-optimal for both.  I suppose if you have other Samsung devices, such as the watch, then maybe the Samsung environment may be important to you.UPDATE: 9July2024I'm loving it even more with time.  I rarely have to open it up.  Even with writing text messages, while the external keyboard is smaller than the internal, the folded phone fits so comfortably and securely in my hands, I am able to type just as well as with a standard keyboard.With my old phone I was always, annoyingly, aware that my phone was in my pocket.  With this, I often find my self checking my pocket to make sure it is there.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Christopher Ramirez', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Good Phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I enjoy using this phone it has a pretty decent value for the cost I must say that the battery leaves much to be desired which is understandable considering that it is a folding phone.

I can say I’ve been really happy with it.Coming into this phone knowing about the lack of water resistance and questionable physical durability I knew that I would have to treat it very gingerly if it was going to hold up at all, which has not been an issue after 4 months of use. I have been very proactive in not doing anything to challenge it’s physical limitations. Although I’m curious how well this phone could survive a significant drop unto a hard surface, such as concrete, I’ve been very protective of this device and very careful in how I’ve handled it and that’s been no problem for me.What’s really blown me away about the Pixel 3a is something very few have mentioned which is how well wifi-calling works with it. My provider, Mint Mobile, which is a T-Mobile reseller supports wifi-calling but it has to be configured on the phone you are using in addition to enabling it on the provider. No problem with Mint Mobile and an unlocked Pixel 3a. So, the cellular signal in my house is not the greatest. It’s ok but nothing to write home about so call quality is not always the greatest. That’s where wifi calling comes in and the beauty of it is that it’s totally transparent, coming on at home and at other places where the cellular signal is poor or non-existent. Since wifi is available where I need it, most everywhere these days, call quality is not an issue, even in an environment with a poor quality cellular signal. What strikes me the most is the phone’s ability to transition to and from wifi calling without call interruption or loss. So, when I leave my house while in a call, I don’t lose the call as the phone transitions from wifi calling to cellular. For me, this has been the biggest plus of the phone.Of course the quality of the camera is the one outstanding feature that is most often talked about and I have to admit it can take incredible pictures.  I also like the display and battery life is more than sufficient for my purposes. I’m not a game enthusiast so game performance is of no importance. The phone is very responsive and I really haven’t experienced any performance issues. YouTube, YouTube TV and Pluto work wonderfully on this device. I think the sound, both on speakers and bluetooth is very good.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tony Flores', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Pixel 3a best all around phone at the best price.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2019', 'Review Body': 'So much has been said about this phone, so I will try to boil it down. I have waited over three weeks before posting my thoughts.1. In December 2019 for $299 pre Black Friday limited time offer, no phone has a better camera and software combo. If you double the price, still can’t name a new phone at this writing that can beat it. Google just added the ability to photograph the stars like the pixel 4. This mode is automatic. The phone needs to be on a tripod or otherwise completely still for the long exposure mode be enabled.2. Less talked about, this particular version G020G US version has band 71 for TMOBILE, their new 600mhz band. This band will do more to make sure you get actual coverage rather than try to get you some high speed. Yes this phone supports all the major carriers, and having that rare (at this time) band 71 is nice.3. So other positives, Oled screen, always on display, be the first in line along with the essential phone to get bug fixes, security patches at the newest version of android.4. Headphone jack, let’s all say that one more time headphone jack.5. Dual speakers, one bottom firing the other is the ear piece.6. Stock android, no skin just the basics.7. Battery. Not in the pros or cons. It’s fine, not the crazy 14 hour heavy use champ, but it has never come up short for me.Some cons.1. Screen is that tall skinny aspect ratio. No my favorite. On the plus side easier to hold and reach all of the screen without issues.2. Because this budget budget phone is missing the dedicated image processing chip it takes longer to process images. You can still fire off as many as you feel the need to but to see the finished image, there will be a short wait. The lower the light level, the longer the wait. Not a deal breaker because the images are usually just so good.3. Screen is just a hair warmer than I’m used to. I have adjusted to it, but I mention it because you cannot adjust warmth.4. Speakers are on the weak side. Sound is even, good quality just not very loud.5. Notification sounds are too soft.6. Camera has no manual controls or any real controls. When the camera chooses the wrong white balance I cannot do anything really. Sometimes changing my aim slightly will cause the camera to choose something better but that doesn’t always work. Also a big pain. There is a big crop in video mode to aid stabilization so your field of view will get really tight. I don’t like this all all. It’s one of those things that isn’t mentioned often.

Estamos ante el último móvil de Doogee. Soy usuario asiduo de este tipo de móviles ultrarresistentes, los cuales principalmente utilizo cuando voy al campo o hacer deporte. Conocía la marca Doogee por ser una de las famosas en el sector, aunque un poco más caras que otras opciones rugerizadas. Sinceramente, tras morir mi último teléfono creo que el extra de dinero merece la pena. Estamos ante un móvil grande y pesado, pero que rebosa resistencia y batería por todos lados, la batería me ha llegado a durar 3 días, 2 días con un uso normal, aunque la velocidad de carga es normalita tirando a baja. En lo referente al apartado multimedia, destacaría sus altavoces, suenan muy muy fuertes, y su cobertura, que nunca me ha dado problemas por las rutas que tiro. Eso sí, la pantalla me parece regulera, tanto en tonos de colores como en resolución. El móvil viene con Android 12, una de las últimas versiones, y es bastante potente, he podido jugar a juegos como call of duy, slay the spire y genshin impact sin problemas. Se me ha caído un par de veces y sin rasgo alguno, además los puertos vienen protegidos por unas gomitas, que le da una protección extra frente al polvo y agua.En general, estoy muy satisfecho con la oferta de black friday que conseguí en Amazon. Espero que este móvil me dure más que el anterior, 4 años mínimo.Lo bueno 👍😍- Batería para 2 días- Precio económico- Construcción de metal y rugerizadoLo malo 👎😭- Mala calidad de pantalla- Muy pesadoEs un smartphone con el que no te vas a equivocar.

It\'s downright cute.It\'s also an interesting device.  I assumed it would be running some really stripped down Android, but it\'s running an OS called Mocor which offers a pretty refined dumb phone interface.  Seriously, if you used a cell phone in 2004, it shouldn\'t take you long to get the hang of what you\'re doing with this thing.  Apparently this is the OS that was on the re-released Nokia 3310 3g back in 2017.  It seems to be pretty refined.  I didn\'t run into any bugs while using it.I couldn\'t tell you a lot about that re-released 3310, but don\'t expect old school Nokia-like durability out of this device.  Its outer shell is a soft plastic.  I dropped it onto concrete from maybe two and a half feet up and it left little boogered up places in two spots.  It didn\'t damage the phone\'s operation at all, fortunately.I was worried about battery life since the included (fully removable and replaceable) battery is only 1000mAh, but since it\'s not a touch-screen smartphone the battery actually lasts a long time.  I think I went about 10 days before I had to recharge it (95% of that standby).  It\'s got a USB-C charging port.  It also has pins on the bottom so you can use the included charging stand.  It also includes a short USB-C cable to plug into either the phone or the base and a 0.55A charging brick.The box also contains a SIM card and brochure for Speedtalk Mobile.  I had never heard of them before, but their pricing is pretty competitive.  A brief look around their website didn\'t reveal to me which carrier network they use, but I suspect it\'s T-Mobile since they have ""America\'s Largest 5G Network"" in a portion of their marketing material, which is a marketing term used by T-Mobile as well.  Since the phone is unlocked for other carriers, I saw no need to test the Speedtalk service.It has a decent manual included, though for a phone that seems to be wanting to market toward seniors, they could have made it bigger.  The print isn\'t as minuscule as what\'s in the instructions that come with a lot of overseas products you see nowadays, but any seniors will definitely need to get their readers out to get anywhere with it.I was able to make and receive calls on the T-Mobile network (through Mint Mobile).  I could also send and receive SMS and MMS messages.  It did take a little bit to get registered on their network completely.  It showed T-Mobile as the carrier for a while and wouldn\'t let me make or receive calls, but after 20-30 minutes I could.  You can still disable caller id for your outgoing calls with this device, something that\'s been missing from Android for quite some time now.It recognized and showed reception for Verizion (via Visible) but I was unable to make or receive calls, nor could I send or receive txts.  I left that SIM in the phone for over a day just to make sure.  Verizon I believe is now implementing a draconian cell white list like AT&T (eg only letting Apple or Samsung devices on their network other than the ones they sell themselves).You can pair bluetooth headsets to make calls and listen to media from the internal storage or sdcard.  There is no 3.5mm jack and I have no way of testing but I really doubt if a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter would work with this device.  There also is no camera.  To my knowledge there is no GPS chip onboard, which makes this pretty ideal as a burner phone.  Finally, though I mentioned it before, the screen is not a touch screen.  The only thing that sets it apart from classic dumb phones is its 4G VoLTE and Bluetooth support.It has a pretty nice FM radio app.  It auto searches for channels that have good reception the first time you run it and it doesn\'t require anything extra to be plugged in to it for it to work unlike most Androids.  The downside to the radio app is that it won\'t play over bluetooth, only the phone\'s internal speaker.  The internal speaker isn\'t bad.  It\'s easily on par with your typical mid-budget Android device.I didn\'t test the SOS function, but that could come in handy for the target audience.  In addition to seniors, this would make a pretty great first phone for kids or maybe even teens who struggle to use their smart phone responsibly.  A third target audience would be where I find myself sometimes--on the edge of wanting to get as far off the grid as possible.  This phone, or one like it, would be a good start toward that end.The flashlight function utilizes and LED bulb located on the top of the phone that is fairly bright.  Since it\'s main purpose is to be a flashlight and not a flash bulb for photography, it actually projects light like a flashlight so it works better than the led torches on most smartphones.It has an sdcard slot underneath the battery along with the two SIM slots.  I am unsure what the maximum capacity for the sdcard is, as I couldn\'t find it in the listing nor in the product manual.  When plugged into a computer it functions as a USB Mass Storage device rather than an MTP device as Android has since version 5 or thereabouts.The buttons are large and faintly backlit when awake.  They make a satisfying clicky noise when you press them.  Everything about the phone just feels good to me, like some genuine love was sprinkled in with the engineering.  I\'m not really familiar with what dumb phones are available on the market right now, but this has got to be one of the best.  A few times while using it I felt a lot of nostalgia for technologically simpler days.If you\'re looking for a smart phone but got here because of the price, be aware that there is at least one smart phone in this price range which can perform adequately with Android (you can peruse my reviews from this year to find it).  If you or the intended recipient of this phone needs a working phone in its simplest form, or desires to avoid being tracked and listened to on-demand by corporations or government agencies, then this phone deserves serious consideration.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Doodle lover', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Basic phone for calls', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024', 'Review Body': 'This is a very basic ""dumb"" phone, by that I mean that it is primarily for phone calls no internet browsing or apps.

Great flip phone, works well for texting and calling. Camera is surprisingly great, about the quality of the iPhone 4/5.

Google maps is functional and is convenient in dire circumstances. I chose the unlimited talk and text plan, and after auto-refilling, it came out to only $15 a month.One problem: It seems others have had this issue—occasionally the screen will go to static or black and everything will crash. Sometimes the phone resets itself, but usually the only fix is to remove the battery, put it back in again, and turn on the phone. This is my go-to way to hard-reset the phone. It happens about once a week or so.After only ever owning a smartphone, this was a great change. I find myself reading more and spending less time online.

It comes with google maps and an appstore (albeit limited, but there are some great apps on there like a podcast player and a pdf viewer that work just fine!). There is no whatsapp on this phone, although the Nokia 6300 has it. It connects to wifi just fine, and the internet browser works great as well. It's sort of slow, so it keeps you from wasting time on frivolous doom scrolling. Youtube is available as well, and it plays videos quite decently. It has both a headphone jack and bluetooth capabilities. I don't think it has a hotspot though, but I haven't set up my mobile service so I can't comment on that.  I can't comment on the battery life yet either, as I've only had it for about a day. You can easily load music, video, and document files onto it by connecting it to your computer. All in all, it's a pretty solid phone for those who don't want to use a smartphone, but also need to be able to use internet functions when they are out and about.

However, upon receipt and inspection of the actual product, it's clear that this is not the case. Similarly, the ad and box claim that the phone has a metal frame, but in reality, it's made of plastic.Despite these misleading aspects, the phone itself is fairly reliable, especially considering its lower-end positioning. The call functionality and texting work splendidly, and the overall responsiveness of the device is pretty satisfactory.The screen, while visible and functional, leaves room for improvement. The viewing angles are limited, which can sometimes hinder the user experience. However, given the phone's price point, this is an understandable compromise.The phone's cameras are passable for basic needs, and you could definitely manage with them. The email functionality is efficient, the keyboard user-friendly, and the touch responsiveness is satisfactory.In conclusion, this phone is a decent choice for those who need a basic, cost-effective device. However, it's crucial for potential buyers to be aware that the advertising claims are not entirely truthful, specifically regarding the storage capacity and the frame material.With more accurate advertising, this phone could have easily earned a solid four stars.

I still recommend getting a screen protector and case, because not everything is full proof. Kids can still do the impossible. So bare that in mind.It's a shame that the main company Bullitt Group went out of business and is no longer supporting this device which means the proprietary apps provided won't work. However, the proprietary apps were redundant anyway. You can get the same features just by downloading apps from the Google Play Store.Please note that this device runs on Android 11 OS which is no longer being supported by Android as of Feb 2024 which means you'll won't be getting future security updates anytime soon. However many apps will still run from the Google Store which I have trial and tested. Therefore, you'll have many years of good usage. In addition, I will state that we were able to get the last updates of Android 11 and related security features.I do love the fact that this device has a reprogrammable button where you can set it to open or use any feature. The camera is a bit slow to focus, but takes good quality pictures. The sound quality is good, but not very loud in a noise environment when listening to apps. Speaker phone however is perfect. It has good reception, wifi and bluetooth connections.The price is affordable with plenty of additional storage options. I am able to use a 256gb Micro SD.

It’s actually made of metal to help with the ruggedness/durability.  The camera lenses are also recessed slightly from the body by 0.6mm to provide added protection if you lay your phone down flat either face up or face down.There are 2 contact points on the back cover.  I believe these are charging contacts when placed into a dock or some sort.The sides/edges are all aluminum.  It provides a very premium look/feel to the phone.  Unfortunately, the aluminum feels smooth/slick in the hands and therefore not very secure when held, but the rounded edges does make it comfortable to hold.The back cover is made of plastic with a knurled patch on the lower half to provide added grip.  I do wish the same material wrapped around the sides so the phone would feel more secure in my hands.The phone weighs approx. 258g, which is actually not that bad as my Samsung S23FE with case is actually 259g, so it’s not as heavy as expected.The buttons all feel like metal, which adds to the phone's premium feel.  They have knurling on the power and feature button to provide a different feel vs the smooth volume buttons.  It may provide extra grip when pressing, but I think it’s more to differentiate between the buttons.The position of the volume/power buttons seem to be reversed vs other mobile phones I’ve used/seen.  The power button is on top while the volume is on bottom.  This is definitely a bit confusing and something I will need to get used to.All the buttons are very tactile and provides a slight click when pressed so you know when you pressed a button.The bottom of the phone contains the USB-C charging port as well as the single down firing speaker.The left of the device houses the cover for the SIM & MicroSD tray and an orange feature button.  When I took the phone out of the box, I noticed that the SIM tray cover was open.  I just thought it wasn’t closed when shipped but found out quickly that it automatically reopens on its own after 20-30mins.  Seems there’s a slight defect with the product as this will affect the water resistance of the phone.  The feature button can be setup for different functions depending on how it’s pressed.  It can be setup to open specific apps and the system provides a list of options.Comes with a USB-C wall charger, which is rare to see these days.Boot-up/Setup:On first power on, you see a T-Mobile logo.  Setup is similar to any other Android phone.  Once setup is complete, reboots/power on only takes approx. 30secs to get into the OS, which is significantly faster than current flagship phones.The screen is clear but does seem a bit dimmer than other rugged phones I have tested even with the brightness at 100%.The phone came with Android 10, but it did detect and installed Android 11 without issue.When checking the settings, it indicated that the phone was locked to T-Mobile.  When I selected the option to permanently unlock, it unfortunately produces a “Server Error: Error Code 255”.  I inserted my active SIM card and still shows as locked.  I read some other product reviews, and someone indicated that the phone showed locked but was still able to make calls and access cellular data.  I didn’t even try to test, but with the SIM installed, it actually worked properly.  I was able to make calls and surf the internet without issues, so it does look like the phone is unlocked even though the phone reports it as locked to T-Mobile.It was able to achieve an LTE+ connection and running a speed test was able to hit over 30mbps download speeds.I’m not a fan of the stock Android OS interface as it feels clumsy (to me) vs the custom interface provided by Samsung, including the applications.  Customization is a bit limited in some areas (e.g. changing the lock screen wallpaper & home screen wallpaper to match).Fingerprint Reader:The fingerprint reader on the back detects my fingerprint very quickly and approx. 98% of the time.  There were a few times it did not detect, some because I didn’t contact the full sensor while others just didn’t read it.  Overall, detection is good and the screen unlocks quickly.I find the actual fingerprint sensors better than the on-screen sensors.  This is a defined location that is fairly hard to miss while you may miss the on-screen sensor depending on how you hold the phone.  They’re also affected by screen protectors.  I would probably prefer if the sensor was on the power button as that doesn’t require the phone to be picked up in order to unlock like the sensor on the back of the phone.Speaker:The single down firing speaker at the bottom of the phone is surprisingly powerful.  It doesn’t contain a lot of bass, but depending on how the phone is positioned, you can get some very loud audio.  Holding the phone in portrait (upright) the speaker will blast the audio towards you.  Placing the phone flat on the table in portrait or landscape (upright/sideways) will cause the audio to reflect off the table and back up at you making the audio louder.  But, if you hold the phone in landscape (sideways) with your hand (not on the speaker side), it won’t reflect the audio back at you and you lose a good 25% of the volume level.  And, if you accidently cover the speaker with your finger, you lose a good 75% or more, so be careful not to cover the speaker grille.Cameras:The rear of the device shows 2 camera lenses, but the system only reports as 1 camera mode, so I’m not sure what the 2nd lens is for.  I went through all the modes and found that only the bottom lens is real & functional.  Another bad item is that the lenses are made of plastic.  It’s more shatter resistant in a fall, but prone to scratches.The product specs indicate the main camera is 48MP, but the actual camera’s settings indicate it’s actually 12MP using quad pixel technology.  Basically, it uses 4 adjacent pixels to make 1 image pixel called pixel binning, so the image quality is supposed to look better using a lower megapixel camera sensor.  The front camera is correctly labelled as 8MP.Taking pictures with the main camera and I found that it doesn’t handle exposure correctly.  When focusing the camera on a brighter light source, the entire image will dim and depending on how bright it is, will dim down to the point the surrounding image is so dark you can only see the bright source.  I found later that this is when in room light situations.  When outside on a sunny day, it does a better job.Pictures are surprisingly decent.  I compared images with my Samsung S23FE and took a photo of a seat cushion, I found this phone capture clearer/sharper images of the surface of the cushion while the Samsung blurred the surface via its software processing to give it a softer/blurrier look.Videos on the main camera are not the best only recording at only 1080p @ 2MP.  As mentioned above the auto exposure is not great and darkens videos when you don’t want them darkened.  You can see a lot of shimmering/noise around surface edges (trees, buildings, cars & people) and pretty much anything that moves.The front camera is spec’d at 8MP.  Selfies are ok but contains a lot of noise throughout the image.  It looks to be over sharpened to try to increase the detail levels.  Something in a pinch and it’s fine, but I wouldn’t use this for my main camera while on vacation as permanent memories is where you want as much quality and detail as you can get, and this front camera will not provide that level of detail.  Again, this mainly depends on how much light there is, the brighter it is the sharper the image.I did notice that for some reason when recoding videos with the front camera in Portrait orientation, my head/face is squished down so my face is wider than it should be.  Details around me seem OK, but there’s no real comparative vs a face.  I placed just my hand and the same issue.  I tested in Landscape orientation and found everything looked correct, so there’s definitely something wrong with the camera or software that just doesn’t like portrait mode in the front selfie camera.  That’s a disappointment as this is probably the orientation most will use when taking a selfie as it’s the easiest position to hold the phone.Main Camera Photo Details:- Dimensions: 3000 x 4000- Mega Pixels: 12MP (Quad Pixel)- Resolution: 72dpi- Bit Depth: 24- File Size: 4.42MB- File Extension: JPGSelfie Camera Photo Details:- Dimensions: 2448 x 3264- Mega Pixels: 8MP- Resolution: 96dpi- Bit Depth: 24- File Size: 2.36MB- File Extension: JPGMain Camera Video Details:- Dimensions: 1920 x 1080 (or 1080 x 1920 in Portrait Orientation)- Mega Pixels: 2.1MP- Video Bit Rate: 9671kbps (may go up/down depending on environment lighting conditions)- Frame Rate: 30fps- Audio Bit Rate: 101kbps- Channels: 2 (Stereo)- Audio Sample Rate: 48kHz- File Size: 8.54MB for 7secs of video- File Type: MP4Front Selfie Camera Video Details:- Dimensions: 1920 x 1080 (or 1080 x 1920 in Portrait Orientation)- Mega Pixels: 2.1MP- Video Bit Rate: 8962kbps (may go up/down depending on environment lighting conditions)- Frame Rate: 30fps- Audio Bit Rate: 94kbps- Channels: 2 (Stereo)- Audio Sample Rate: 48kHz- File Size: 15.5MB for 13secs of video- File Type: MP4Performance:I ran a few benchmark tests to see how it stacked up.  I was surprised to see it didn’t perform that well vs other older model phones.- 3DMark Sling Shot Test: 1863 (a Samsung Galaxy S7 from 2016 had a rating of 2908)- AnTuTu 3DBench Lite v10.2.1:  o Marooned – OpenGL ES 3.0 (Onscreen=9.54fps, Offscreen=8.81fps)  o Coastline – OpenGL ES 3.0 (Onscreen=9.89fps, Offscreen=8.71fps)- GeekBench6: CPU-Single Core=318, Multi Core=1239 / GPU=252- PCMark: Work 3.0 Performance=6178 (Samsung S7 from 2016 had a rating of 5021)The performance numbers weren’t great as it has trouble outperforming a phone released 2016.  Yes, it was a flagship phone at its release, but I would have hoped something released in 2021 would beat something that came out 7 years earlier.Based on the gaming numbers, the phone is not meant for gaming.  Very basic stuff will work, but not more graphics intensive games as it was only able to get just below 10fps.Using it to view videos on YouTube and surf the internet is perfectly fine.  There is some lag when loading additional videos/graphics but is still ok.Moving around in the phone, swiping screen, taking photos, switching menus all seem fine.  There is some lag for the camera to load images from the gallery and open the editor, but again, this is not a flagship phone.Using my USB-C power meter, I was able to find out that the phone will draw a maximum of approx. 17W while charging.  It’s not a fast-charging phone, but still reasonable.Battery runtime on the phone dropped approx. 10% when performing the benchmark tests.  After approx. 4 days, with light usage taking photos, moving around on the phone menus and setting it up, watching YouTube and listening to music, the battery finally dropped down to approx. 14%.  All that time the phone was connected to WiFi but had no SIM card.  The phone seems to drop almost 6-8% every day while on standby with the screen off and minimal to no use.Durability Test:I tested the ruggedness of the phone by performing a couple tests, a water dunk as well as a drop test.  This always makes me nervous but it needs to be done.I was probably more worried about the water dunk test because of the issue with the SIM tray cover popping open on its own after some time.  If water was going to get in, this is where it will happen.  Luckily, the cover has been staying closed for longer with more use and me pressing down on it every time I use the phone.  This is definitely something that needs to be addressed in the factory.For the water test, I filled a container full of water and dropped the phone in while it was recording a video.  I was happy to see that it successfully passed the dunk test.  The touch screen worked but did have some recognition issues when I touched the screen while there were water drops moving around on the screen.  I needed to wipe off some of the water before it registered my swipes.  The speaker was probably the only thing affected by the water as it cut the audio volume way down.  Luckily, this was only temporary as once the water was cleared out (or dried up) the output volume returned.The drop test was next.  This is always an iffy one, if the design is lacking then that means the phone will crack/break and that’s it for the phone.I setup the phone in my kitchen at approx. countertop height (36”) and started the recording on the phone.  I held it on the corner to try to get the phone impact the hard tile floor on its edge.  The phone drops and it struck the corner and survived.  Looking at the phone I could see a ding on the corner/edge.  On closer inspection, the dent was at the top edge towards the screen and there was a dent.  It moved closer to the glass, but not enough to cause an issue.  The phone was still working, and the video was still recording, so it looks like it withstood the abuse.Pros:- IP68 & MIL-SPEC 810H Certified for water/dust resistance and drop/impact resistance.- Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen glass.- Very nice looking design with an all-aluminum frame.- Comfortable to hold with the rounded edges.- Durable, can take a drop from at least countertop height onto hard tile with only a scuff/dent in the frame but the phone was still 100% functional.- Supports a MicroSD card up to 256GB for added storage.- Surprisingly comes with a USB-C charging adapter & USB-C to USB-C charging cable.  Not only that, it also comes with a small USB-C to USB-A dongle so you can plug your phone into any computer/wall adapter using the USB-A connector.  This is definitely a welcomed bonus.- Not as heavy as expected at only 258g as current flagship phones are slightly lighter but can’t take a hit like this phone.- Photo quality from its main 12MP camera (not actually 48MP) is actually not bad.- Audio is fairly loud for a single down firing speaker.- Decent battery runtimeCons:- One major QC fail is with the SIM Tray cover.  It’s supposed to keep the device watertight, but unfortunately, there’s a design issue or a problem with the one on my phone as it doesn’t stay inserted into the phone.  I noticed this when I opened the box but just thought it was left that way during packing, but after approx. 20mins, the cover pops completely open exposing the innards to water, dust and dirt.  QC definitely needs to be improved at the factory to prevent major issues like this.- The back cover is plastic, which helps its impact resistance, but I found knocking on it, it sounded a bit hallow.- OS is limited to Android 11 and doesn’t look like it will be getting any more security updates.- Processor is a few years old, so not the best performer.- Front selfie camera quality lacking in normal light conditions.  Photos are usable but has a lot of noise.  Better quality appears when photos taken on a very sunny day.- No 3.5mm headphone jack that is available on other rugged phones.- Camera is marketed as a 48MP camera, but it’s actually a 12MP sensor, so a bit misleading.- Videos taking using the main rear camera only records at 1080p @ 2.1MP, which produces average quality images with a lot of noise.- Front camera can’t take proper videos in Portrait orientation.  The video is compressed so items seem wider than they should be.  It does work fine in Landscape orientation, so a problem with the camera or software.Final Impression:Overall, the CAT S62 rugged phone worked well.  Comfortable to hold, doesn’t look like a rugged phone, but capable of being dunked in water and dropped onto the floor without major damage (slight ding).  It’s not a gaming phone or anywhere near a flagship but if you don’t have a flagship phone next to it to compare, the phone does work fairly well opening/switching apps, watching videos and moving around on the phone menus.  Photos aren’t the best but is actually ok.  Videos on the other hand are a bit sub-par in my opinion.  The major flaw for my phone was the issue with the SIM slot cover opening up on its own after some time.  This can really affect its waterproof status and damage the phone, so better QC is definitely required.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Olivier', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on April 21, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Nice phone.

Technically, you can access wifi with it, but the controls are so painful you\'d never actually want to.

If you need a phone that does that, and not much else, this phone will do the job!  That\'s what I got it for, and I am very happy with it.

I purchased the Nokia for the sole reasoning to improve my habits of staring at that shattered glass screen for an unnecessary amount of time when I need that time to be productive and, well, connect with the world. But anyway, here are my pros and cons I noticed while using this phone over the weekend. (And some things to clarify after reading other reviews)Pros:-Calls sound good and you sound good on their end-SMS/MMS texts pop up on their end-All the advertised apps appeared and work decently (YouTube, Google Search/Maps, WhatsApp, QR Reader)-Snake is a classic as well as Crossy Road and Doodle Jump-FM Radio works well and sounds good too-Loaded music files via microSD storage all play seemlessly either with headphones or BluetoothCons:-No physical volume buttons, which kinda bothers me a little-Internet browser is very limited even when loading simple websites-Your group text responses send to each group member individually instead of the group (bug?)-Google Maps is text/manual navigation only for those who only rely on its voice assistant-Camera quality is fine but not the best for indoor photos-The promised apps will only show up if you insert the SIM card to the phone (makes sorta sense but not so much for WIFI only users)Transferring the SIM over from one phone to this one was simple. Since I have an iPhone, before using your SIM on the Nokia, go to the settings and uncheck your number to receive iMessages from (on Messages tab in the main Settings menu). After that, you should be able to send SMS and MMS messages from your Nokia at an ease.Well, that\'s about it! This phone, overall, is a 4/5 in my book. It is not entirely perfect, some flaws to be aware but a good phone to use overall. A good way to disconnect from the loud world every once in a while, or to slowly improve screen time. Probably both. I\'d recommend this to anyone, like me, who wants a backup phone to use, a replacement to ditch your smartphone entirely (you brave soul), or to parents who want their kids to get their first phone. Get yourself a cheap prepaid phone plan and begin that journey with this beloved little gadget.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Nataly Marentes', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Eficiente', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Mi mamá necesitaba un buen celular que tuviera forma de conectar a internet y este fue el indicado no es difícil de manejar al contrarios es fácil para cuando no sabes manejar un celular táctil recomendado\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'abeer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on June 23, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Good price with good quality\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Rechot', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Very good\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 27, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Bought this phone as advertised with WhatsApp, wanted to reduce my social media use with a more basic phone.

Of course. I dare say, it\'s better than the ""haha"" I had hoped it would give me, and gave me the ""please be more than useable"" I really wanted.The TL;DR is IT WORKS. ITS FUN. ITS TINY. ITS AMAZING. BUY THIS PHONE, THE PRICE IS WORTH IT. Seriously. I\'m so extremely elated to own a tiny phone like this that can do most everything I expected from it.To start, the screen. It\'s tiny, yes, but it\'s also looks pretty good. Peel off the manufacturer\'s fuzzy screen protector, and you have a serviceable screen. At that size, you need a high enough resolution that gives you clarity, and this phone delivers. Also, the text all seem to be manipulated by a custom android OS made to give legibility and formatting to work on the small screen. Chrome and other apps were all sized and formatted in a way that everything was easy to read, no need to zoom.You might think typing is difficult on the screen, but my secret weapon for you is Gboard. Download the keyboard from the Play store, and turn on Glide. Boom, you can now swipe/Swype/glide with ease. I typed my typical book-long messages to my viewers in Discord with ease. Hangouts? No issues. Side note: there is a custom keyboard in it, it might have glide/Swype, but I didn\'t use it. Gboard is my jam, so I went with that.I downloaded quite a few apps for this phone, and some intensive games. They all ran acceptably, but a few stuttered. Honestly, if you want to game hardcore, you\'re looking at the wrong phone. Emulating with a Bluetooth controller, though? Chefs kiss, babay, it handles the classics of the 16 bit era quite well. Definitely a nice teeny pocket handheld. And, hey, Alto\'s Adventure ran beautifully.Quick tip: use Nova Launcher and give it a more traditional Android look, it\'ll make the phone feel more complete. It runs perfectly with a custom launcher.The typical features of a phone were all FINE on this. Great volume, strong vibrate, the Bluetooth worked wonderfully to make this an MP3 player, and so on. The cameras on the front and back are pretty low quality in low light, but they snapped acceptable pics. You\'ll be wanting a different device for higher quality photos, come on. Battery life is great. Full charge in an hour, idled on for three days without dying. I left it sitting at 75 percent, from me playing on it for about 45 minutes. It might not be an all day phone using it nonstop, but the faster charge is nice.Phone calls were great. If you don\'t want to hold a tiny phone, use Bluetooth. I used it, with zero issue, perfect call quality. Any bad areas in town were still bad areas with this phone, but that\'s to be expected.Oh, also, it came with all the goodies. A screen protector. Charging cable. Sim card slot puller. AND A CUTE LITTLE CASE.I use a Note 20 Ultra as my daily phone. I used this for 5 days straight, and will keep carrying it around, along with that behemoth. I\'m in love with it. It\'s ridiculous, you know this. But, it\'s actually serviceable, if you need a small alternative. Will it fit every situation? Maybe not. But it\'ll most likely fill yours, if you\'re here. The price is about right, in my humble opinion.I will be posting a video of my time with it elsewhere, keep an eye out for Havok Versus Everything, or find me just to chat. I will yell about how much I love this thing.If you have any more questions, ask in the question section and I will answer the best I can. There\'s too much to say, and a lot of intricacies to owning a phone I might not have thought of off the top of my head. I got ya, just ask.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'MW', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'DOES NOT EORK ON CRICKET OR AT&T AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT IN ENGLISH', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024', 'Review Body': ""The words on the phone screen are NOT in ENGLISH!!!!

The first thing I noticed was the large screen—it’s bright, clear, and great for watching videos or browsing social media. Even though it's a budget phone, the display feels much more expensive.The phone feels nice to hold, and the design is sleek and modern. I love that it doesn’t feel bulky in my hand, and the large screen makes everything so much easier to see and interact with.Using the Xgody X31 has been smooth and pretty enjoyable. Apps open quickly, and I haven’t experienced any major lag, even when switching between multiple apps. I’m not a heavy gamer, but for daily tasks like messaging, browsing, and watching videos, it works perfectly fine.One thing I really appreciate is the battery life. I can go more than two days without needing to charge it, which is a huge relief. I’m not constantly worried about my phone dying while I’m out and about.The face unlock feature is a nice touch—it’s quick and convenient, and I’ve gotten used to it very quickly. The cameras are decent too; they’re not going to replace a high-end camera, but for capturing quick photos and selfies, they do the job just fine.Overall, using this phone has been a positive experience. It’s reliable, easy to use, and offers way more than I expected at this price point.

However, I haven't stress-tested it yet to see if it can handle mid-level Play Store games.I had a poor experience with their A4 model, which was extremely laggy with even basic apps, likely due to its lower 2GB RAM and minimal ROM. I had to rely on an SD card, which bottlenecked its already struggling performance. I’m hopeful this model will perform better, but it’s only day two, so I’m still testing and debloating the pre-installed apps. I’ll update my findings as I continue to use it.

No, it's not worth it."", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I understand you get what you pay for because I have been buying cheap phones for years. But, this phone is by far the worst.Out of the box, I couldn\'t even configure the most basic option, color theme. Yeah, the option under wallpaper & style? Not there. Is this a Blu issue or Android issue - I don\'t know but it\'s kind of ridiculous that something that simple is missing. I\'m literally stuck with the pink theme and I can\'t change it (yes, I have the most up to date Android installed). I could live with the pink theme so long as the damn phone worked. But, it barely does that.First off, the power/screenshot/lock button is a mess. It\'s impossible to get it to do what I want with any consistency. It\'s too sensitive and poorly designed. It is by far the most frustrating feature on this phone.Next, are the random reboots. I try to get a screenshot and the phone reboots. I go to lock my screen, the phone reboots. Just today, it\'s rebooted 3 times. And I\'m not holding the button down long enough for this to be happening. Quick button presses should not be causing multiple reboots.Then we have the speaker and microphone. The sound coming out of this phone is like an AM radio from 1970. The microphone is just as bad. I used to be able to drive hands free but now I can\'t because anyone I try to talk to tells me they can barely hear me. It doesn\'t matter how close I get to the microphone or how quiet my surroundings are. They simply can\'t hear me.I also read someone else complaining about this phone and 5ghz Wifi. They are absolutely correct. When this phone was on the 5ghz frequency of my Wifi, it constantly dropped the signal. It would repeatedly flip back and forth between strong/weak signal, then drop it all together. Then reconnect and do the same thing over and over. The wireless access point was only a few feet away and not obstructed by anything.I\'m *very* disappointed in this phone. This thing is a nightmare. I do not recommend buying this phone at any price.2 month update:It\'s gotten worse. Now the WiFi randomly drops out on the 2.4ghz range. No warning. One minute it\'s connected, the next, I\'m on cellular. When I reconnect to my WiFi it displays ""!"" next to the WiFi status and has no Internet access. I have to restart my phone or it will stay like this no matter what I do.Speaking of restarting the phone, I still suffer from random reboots, and more recently, have noticed that it\'s been getting laggy. I don\'t install much on my phone. I don\'t game, and I don\'t use any resource intensive apps - so there\'s no reason for this phone to be getting laggy. None.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing. It is absolute garbage. Do NOT buy this phone.Final update:Had this phone a total of 5 months, 16 days and it\'s done. The WiFi on 5ghz or 2.4ghz is so bad, it\'s almost useless. I live in an area with very poor cell coverage so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. I just ordered a new phone today because I had no choice. It\'s money I really did not want to spend but, I need a phone that\'s capable of maintaining a solid WiFi connection. You can say it\'s a pretty safe bet that I won\'t be buying anything from Blu again.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'House', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Phone Great Price', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Wonderful phone I bought on sale at 40 on Amazon used “ clean no scratches “As soon 🔜 I installed the sim card and turn it on start working,But be prepared and patience because you will need to do at  leat 4 software upgrade until you reach Android 13What I like the most is that sim tray you can put 2 sim cards and the SD card at the same time, not like the other phones that offers you 2 sim but is a sim card and  SD card or 2 sim cardGreat I Like a lot and for that price is great\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'DARYL AKER', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Fast charging', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It's big, easy to use, lots of storage.

I went for the Marsh Mellow Blue colour, but the red one is also very fetching and the clear case that comes with it is a clear pastic, so nice to show off without the back getting finger marked or scratched.Just beware the plug that comes with this though, mine came with an EU plug in the box and is meant for retail in mainland Europe, however Motorola assure me that regardless, software updates will come through at the same time as if I'd bought it in the UK.  One nice touch is that mine also came with a car charger, so if you're planning to hit the road, you'll be ready for that too.All in all very happy apart from the EU plug thing, though genuine Motorola chargers are available on Amazon, my recommended option is the 50W charger with dual port USB C and USB A, that way you can charge an extra accessory like headphones from the same socket.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'smarttvminix', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Singapore on February 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Overall robust performance.. volte supported for starhub network.

The Punkt does basically two things: Phone calls, and text messages. The phone call quality is fantastic. The calls are very clear and loud. The speaker also works great. As for text messages, this phone is a big loser. The T9 typing works just fine, but the lack of MMS makes this almost unusable. If you are in a text group, you will not receive most messages and the ones you do will be hard to sort out. I just stopped responding to any group messages. That and the inability to see pictures or GIFS sent is a bummer (although this does work on the signal app, pidgeon. As for the signal app, it's terrible. It's so bad, it's not worth using at all. It's separate from the text app and only works with other people who also have signal which I think is about 10 people worldwide. Also, when you install this app, it will break any other instance you have of signal, so no more signal on desktop or a tablet. Your choices will be: highly restricted lousy Signal or no Signal at all.I gave this thing 3 stars because I think the people who buy it know what they are getting into. Altogether though, it's not very good at the limited things it claims to do. If they improved the texting, it would be expensive but acceptable. Without the texting working well, it's basically a very expensive telephone. If you can swallow your pretensions and just buy a cheap feature phone, you will be much better served.Update: 8/2021 I decided to update the firmware on this phone and after the update, the phone was bricked. Black screen and would not turn on. I contacted Punkt support and they told me they would not issue a refund for their phone that bricked itself after 5 months because I bought it from amazon. They offered to send me a new phone sometime around December (4 months from now). Thankfully this isn't my only phone or I would be screwed. Nonetheless, I will have to go get another phone and definitely not a Punkt phone.All in all, this phone is garbage, even for what it claims to be. I don't expect it to be a smartphone but it is one of the worst dumbphones on the market and definitely the worst dumbphone for the price. Support is absolute garbage and is not willing to stand behind their product and fix major issues in a timely fashion.Like I said before, find another feature phone.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Michael', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'An elegant concept but poorly implemented software', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Update: decided not to return the phone. The limitations described before are still there, but I have agreed to live with them.Had this phone for about a week and a half now. The punkt MP02 is really unmatched in its style and design. For those of us looking for a truly minimalist phone that in all possible ways discourages endless scrolling/ ""app jumping"", yet at the same time provides essential functions like high quality voice calling, minimal texting, and wifi tethering when needed, nothing on the market beats punkt\'s concept. It is an elegant concept with an equally elegant hardware. No news, no social media, no games, no icons - the only reason you will pull this phone out of your pocket is to either call someone, or answer a call. The speaker quality is also excellent.With that said, the phone\'s software is woefully lacking. Fundamental technologies that are standard to the modern world like MMS/group chat and WiFi calling are not supported. Although the Signal platform implemented via the pigeon app works, it is impossible to link an additional device to the punkt as it lacks a camera to scan the QR code. (I\'m okay with no camera, but I wish there was a work-around to link another device). The battery life is very poor - especially for a such a feature-less phone. The battery seems to last about 2 and 1/2 days for me on standby (with me not doing anything at all with the phone). The WiFi tethering eats up the battery at rate of about 40 % in 30 minutes. Even more annoying is the poor reception on T-Mobile\'s network. One would think such a pricey phone that is marketed as a high quality voice phone ""built with the 21st century in mind"" would have a powerful antenna and support every single frequency out there, but the phone barely has network signal in a urban-suburban setting. Network is non-existent when indoors. I can\'t imagine it being hard to implement/ improve these seemingly basic features, but the punkt team really bluffed with the software. I tried so hard to try and justify the price for this phone, but at the end of the day, it doesn\'t make the cut. When you are unable to make and receive phone calls at most times, that really defeats the purpose of any phone - especially that of the punkts. I considered keeping the phone, and hoped they do a major revamp of the software, but I am wary of that ever happening. This phone has been around in some from since 2015. That is plenty of time during which nothing was improved. I will sadly have to return this device before its return deadline expires. Hopefully, Punkt rethinks their strategy and give this beautiful phone the software it deserves.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Leo J.

MP02とdocomoカードケータイの2機種くらいでしょうか。カードケータイはレビューが悪く操作性や電池持ちが不安になり却下。そうなるとPunkt. MP02のみになりました。躊躇したところは大きさ厚み重さ。それと値段が高すぎ。以下、NichiPhone-sとの比較です。・音量音質は良い。クリアで無問題。バイブもOK。因みにNichiPhone-sも音量音質バイブは良いので同等。・電話帳までの操作と検索は優秀。これはMP02がダントツに良い。NichiPhone-sは悪すぎてストレス。・スリープ状態からの操作は、NichiPhone-sはスリープ解除のみ。 MP02はスリープ解除→ロック解除なので面倒なのと、2プッシュのボタン配置が悪く多少やりづらいが、誤動作は起こらなさそうなので良しとします。・SMS送信や文字打ちは良いです。昔、ガラケー打ちやったことある人は問題ないでしょう。フリックしかやったことない人は難しいかも。あと、ここはNichiPhone-sが悪すぎたので大満足です。・予想外に良かったことはショートカットですぐにBluetooth接続可能なところです。職業柄よくハンズフリーで通話するので、これは棚から牡丹餅でした。・反応が鈍いボタンがあるような気がしますが、しっかり押せば問題ないので許容範囲です。・充電がtype-cなのはうれしい。NichiPhone-sはtype-B+アタッチメントなのでアタッチメントがないと充電不可なので論外でした。・デザインがおしゃれ (妻には「それ電卓？」と言われたが…)・あとはNichiPhone-sと比べ、可も不可もないです (NichiPhone-sも極小な割に優秀な機種です)惜しかった部分は…・ストラップホールは欲しかった。ここは自力で対策模索中です。・ホーム画面が時間と日付、曜日のみ(着信等の通知はある) カスタマイズ不能。バッテリー表示くらいは欲しかった。・月と曜日が3文字の英語。Jan、Jun、JulとかTue、Thu、Sat、Sunとか分かりづらくないですか。1、2、3とか月、火、水のほうが直感的で良いのでは。漢字やアラビア数字表記できるのに何で？・使用してひと月以内ですがフリーズが1回。再起動で復旧。他の方のレビューで度々報告されていますが心配な部分ではあります。・ケースは純正品一択のみで社外品は無し。純正ケースは一万円。布製で良さそうではあるものの、どう考えても一万円は高すぎでしょ。・本体が大きく厚く重い。このすべてがNichiPhone-sのちょうど倍になりました。しかしここはNichiPhone-sに勝るものはない。しょうがない。総評ですが満足です。NichiPhone-sより機種変してよかったです。あとは故障しないことを祈ります。長く使いたいです。\nRead more'}]",,B0CB8DYK5Z,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CB8DYK5Z,4g

They provide a good amount of grip to protect and keep your device in place. The hinges on this stand are very strong. Great for keeping your device in place and preventing any wobbling. The rotating base has a nice quiet click to it as it locks into place and the movement is slightly firm but smooth. This is great as it prevents the introduction of wobbling that can happen on looser rotating joints. The stand is small, so can but used with phones as well as tablets. Being small also allows the stand to be lighter and when folded up can easily fit in a bag for travel.Now for the negatives. As stated in the title the stand is quite small. Because of this there are a couple of issues. The first one being it only raises by around 7CM, this is shorter than other tablet stands out there by approximately 4CM. The other issue is due to the stand being small it becomes top heavy with a tablet. Especially if you want the device in portrait. To correct this the stand needs to be tilted further forward thus reducing the height even more. In the photos you can see my iPad 11-inch and although the stand is holding the tablet in portrait the slightest tap would topple it over.While I’m truly impressed by the stands quality, the size lets it down. If this was 20% bigger I doubt any of the issues mentioned above would be apparent. Obviously a lot of this will be on each use case base in how high you want to device to be raise, device size and whether you plan to have said device in landscape or portrait. I look for a stands that raise my device as high as possible so I do not have to look down as much when typing reviews such as these. For the price its around 25% cheaper than other tablet stands out there, but it is also around 20% smaller.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Russ Pitcher', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2024', 'Review Body': ""This stand has a sturdy feel to it and it's well finished.

I first tried Visible (which uses the Verizon network), and almost everything worked fine, except that I couldn't download incoming MMS messages (group texts and picture messages). I contacted support and they tried some troubleshooting steps, but eventually gave up and said that they don't support this model of phone. Next I tried Mint (which uses the T-Mobile network), and now everything is working correctly. In summary, this phone does work on at least some carriers in the United States, but you'll probably be without help if anything goes wrong. I suspect that the 4G band list in the product description is incomplete, given that I got strong signals on both Verizon and T-Mobile.The biggest downside for me is that the GPS doesn't seem very precise, so this phone isn't very useful for turn-by-turn directions. Otherwise it would be five stars for me: it's a great set of features for the price.A few other pros and cons, in no particular order:+ I didn't expect the phone to come with a case and screen protector; this was a delightful surprise.+ The camera and speakers are both better than I expected given the price point.- The Google Play store crashes any time I use the search bar. I can work around this problem by searching for an app in Chrome and clicking the link from there to get to the Play Store, at which point app installation works fine.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'O.K.', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Speaker died after 3 month...

Von der Größe her ist es unglaublich klein und handlich - fast schon befremdlich, so ein kleines Gerät in den Händen zu halten. Trotz des winzigen Bildschirms mit nur 3 Zoll, kann man das Gerät relativ normal bedienen, inkl. Tippen auf der virtuellen Tastatur.Man muss sich bewusst sein, dass man hier weder eine sonderlich starke Leistung vom Prozessor, noch vom Betriebssystem (Android 9) erwarten kann. Es sind einige Apps wie Whatsapp, Youtube und Twitter bereits vorinstalliert, aber ansonsten keine lästige Bloatware. Die vorinstallierten Apps lassen sich auf Wunsch auch löschen. Google Apps sind alle vorhanden. Das scrollen durch das Menü würde ich von der Geschwindigkeit als ""normal"" bezeichnen. Moderne Smartphones können das definitiv flüssiger, aber das liegt auch an der höheren Bildwiederholungsrate der neuen Displays. Auch im Browser oder in Apps fühlt es sich nicht ganz schnell an, aber durchaus brauchbar. Startet man aber zum Beispiel ein Video, wird dieses ganz normal und flüßig abgespielt. Auch die Tonqualität ist OK, sofern man keine lauten Umgebungsgeräusche um sich hat.Der Akku ist wirklich stark und sollte locker 3-4 Tage (oder wahrscheinlich mehr - anfangs habe ich doch sehr viel mit dem Gerät herum probiert) halten. Einerseits ist er mit 2600 mAh großzügig bemessen, andererseits braucht der kleine Display und der schwache Prozessor weniger Energie.Empfangstechnisch und von der Sprachqualität her könnte ich mich nicht beschweren. Auch die Kamera macht halbwegs brauchbare Schnappschüsse bei hellen Lichtverhältnissen, auch wenn natürlich von den drei Linsen nur hinter einer wirklich ein funktionierender Sensor steckt.Das Gerät eignet sich also für jene, die mal ein bisschen digitalen Detox benötigen, aber dennoch im ""Notfall"" zugriff auf Smartphone-Apps benötigen. Der kleine Bildschirm und die etwas langsamer Bedienung trüben nach kurzer Zeit den sonst üblichen Suchtfaktor. Ansonsten ist dieses Smartphone bestimmt auch gut geeignet als Erst-Telefon für Grundschulkinder.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Guedon Melvin', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in France on August 25, 2022', 'Review Body': 'Rien à dire tout fonctionne\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mata Hari', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Germany on June 18, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Natürlich ist das Phone für den typischen Smartphonenutzer ""zu klein"".

I have reviewed two other BezosMax phones before, which were mini clones of the Samsung S23 Ultra, so I am familiar with their game. The satire of their brand name is also not lost on me, so I also give props for that. As for the phone itself, it works fine, if you are just using it as a back-up or emergency phone. It is built on the Android platform, and hence the CPU/RAM/software utilization is nowhere near as good and efficient as the iOS platform. It theoretically can run any apps, since it has the full Google Play Store app, but that doesn't mean it can run any of them well. CPU and RAM intensive apps such as video/streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc. are prone to crashing/memory freeze. If you really need to use them, just make sure you don't have any other apps running in the background. Using the phone app to make calls, taking snapshots, and checking out your photos in the photos app are fine. It's when you open too many apps is when the issues arise, such as major lag/slow-down, app freezing/reseting occurs. Sometimes, it's so bad I have to restart the phone. However, in the end, I rate it four stars, mainly because the phone costs $70. It's cheap enough where it should not be your main phone. If you buy it as your main phone, then you are warned. But if you just use it for making calls and very simple things, you are fine, and a plus is that the phone looks really cute, and something Apple should do for children, or people who love tiny phones.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'I love this cute little phone very much!

I don\'t recall having less than 30%Also, since it is an unlocked phone, there\'s virtually no bloatware pre-installed.Camera is decent - I\'d say up to par with the Motorola Action One if not better.  I use it for videos of my classes as well as snapshots and it handles all lighting conditions well.The only reason I\'m giving it only 4 out of 5 stars is that Nokia elected to put the google assistant permanently on the main screen - I believe a change of launcher will be in order in the foreseeable future.One additional note;  I\'m using the phone on the T-mobile network.  No issues here.  Interesting fact T-mobile sells their branded/locked phone about cheaper than this one.  However, they will charge you an ""Upgrade Fee"" that is roughly the same amount as their lower price.  When I asked them what the service was that this fee supposedly covered, they could not provide a concise answer.Bottom line:  This unlocked version comes to the same price as the T-mobile branded/locked phone and you have less pre-installed ""Stuff"" on it - definitely recommend this one!Update:  lost the software connection to the front facing camera about nine months into using this phone.

Good battery life, nice screen, reasonably fast, and good camera for the price.  No issues using social media, web browsing, and light game playing.  The phone also works well as an actual phone with decent sound quality.  I compared this Nokia G400 5G camera in multiple lighting conditions to a Motorola G Stylus 5G (2021),  and the Nokia had a better picture in every case.  For a phone at this price it has a good camera.  I also compared the camera to a Pixel 7a (which cost more than double) and the Pixel 7a had a better picture in every case (as expected).  So is it the best phone on the market - no, but it is a good phone for under $300.  An excellent value when on sale for under $200.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'eliu', 'Rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Not fully unlocked', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Phone is new, partially unlocked. unable to link with Metro PCS.

We attached the lanyard and she keeps this phone with her wherever she goes in the house or yard just in case she falls or has an emergency.

The slightly opalized, matte-finish of the back of the phone is just beautifully done. The camera optics are not expensive, so it won't be as good as an iPhone, but they're not terrible either - certainly well-worth the price point. The camera software is really nice with lots of modes and options including a night mode and a pro mode. Not too shabby!Features I like: I LOVE that this came with a screen protector already installed - thank you! I also love that it came with a nice silicone case.Bottom line - Altogether, this phone is a truly outstanding value for the <$100 asking price. It's a great option if you are on a budget, want to use a different phone for business, or if you're looking for a decent phone for a teenager who will inevitably shatter and/or lose said phone.

It states it has Volte and has the bands that should work on Tello.  The baffling thing is that I purchased the phone on Amazon, got a SIM card from Tello, activated and called the phone with my other cell phone, and this Artfone worked fine. Then, I sent the phone to a relative who it was actually purchased for, and it now won’t work.  When I called Tello’s customer service, they told me the phone doesn’t have the correct bands even though the description on Amazon states it does.  Additionally, the IMEI code and service area where the phone was (where I live) and where my relative lives all indicate that the phone should work.  This was all checked on Tello’s website and all came up that the phone should work.Companies don’t actually want you to call them. They want you to do everything online.  Then,  when you check everything online, they later tell you the phone is not compatible.  Even though you checked everything Tello stated you needed on their website for the phone to be compatible before purchasing it, it won’t work.  This is even after you entered the IMEI number from the phone, purchased and put in a Tello SIM card as well as activated and tested the phone and it worked temporarily, it now doesn’t.  My question is why?  Why did it work at first and now it won’t and I’m told it doesn't have the right bands? As far as I’m concerned Amazon or Tello should refund me the cost of the phone because both websites were misleading.  Furthermore, Tello should refund me for their SIM card and the cost of a couple of months of their service.  I never write reviews, but I think others should know what happened to me even after I did my due diligence.  I also emailed Tello a couple of different times to confirm what their customer service representative told me on the phone, and all answers were that the phone doesn’t have the correct bands.  This is even though I provided them Amazon’s listing that stated the phone did have the necessary bands.  They had nothing to say other than the phone doesn’t have the correct bands.  There was no apology for their site still telling me the IMEI will work and I’ll get service in the area the phone is.  I don’t know how Tello keeps customers this way, but I now see a few recent Amazon reviews stating that others had difficulties with Tello and this phone.  These reviews were not there when I bought the phone and I actually wonder if the phone did work with Tello a couple of months ago and now no longer works.Zero stars.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Laureen Romey', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'it is small but the buttons are large', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024', 'Review Body': 'It is a nice phone and would work for most people.

I have used the phone less than 2 months and the small speaker by your ear has a bad vibration or something making the phone difficult to use as a phone.  Notifications of calendar events, text messages also make a noise on this speaker and they sound is messed up.  Blackview essentially indicates I have to pay for all of the repairs for this ""rugged"" phone that could not stay together for 2 months.  Perhaps if I had purchased from amazon I might have better options I don\'t know.  Either way, I would not purchase this brand of phone again.  I actually like the phone and would really like it if it worked properly,  It is sort of a heavy little brick of a phone, certainly feels rugged, too bad it doesn\'t live up to being rugged.  I will not go into all of the endless back and forth with the ""Blackview Support"" staff only to say it has been more than a week of emails that essentially keep saying it is my problem to deal with.  My favorite line from their support was, ""You should contact the seller"", which since I bought it directly from the Blackview website I  thought I was doing.

Still enjoying the device. The picture saving lag fixed itself. Camera was adequate on vacation - embrace some lofi style editing and it's good. I do notice the wifi seems to lag sometimes (often). Biggest issue is keyboard size and accuracy. I use a lot of swipe and predictive keyboard. Phone still great for daily useI was tired of carrying around gigantic phones - but still needed Android for apps, android auto, and a decent camera. After looking around a bunch decided on picking this up. Also considered the Jelly but this seemed to have a better phone and more features. Feels great in your hand - but pretty thick compared to conventional devices. Height is perfect. Has everything you need - NFC payments, Face ID, fingerprint, a decent rear speaker, and pretty solid rear and front cameras. Works with Google Fi.My biggest issue is a really long lag after you take a picture while it seems to be saving it. Feels like 8-10s seconds. You can't take another photo and it seems to not save the photo if you switch out of the camera app too fast. It's a few less seconds if you decrease the default file size to 5 MP. The 48 MP shots take a really long time to save. Seems to do better with some 3rd party camera apps but still an issue. Kinda weird and makes you realize you comprimised a bit for a smaller form factor.Overall still glad I picked this up and I am done with giant 6+ inch screens\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Albino lopez', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': '20 days and so far...', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023', 'Review Body': ""A few adjustments on the display and you will be fine.

I canceled the Speedtalk plan I had chosen after trying the phone the next day and it not connecting at all again. I eventually went to T-mobile and got a sim to replace the one from my wife's lost phone (which is why I wanted to try this cheap phone in the first place) and the phone worked like it should, connecting quickly and getting good signal strength. So now she has a decent phone that she can use when she is out and I won't worry about her being able to call quickly and not have to wait for the Speedtalk sim to find a network to connect to and then eventually connecting with a phone.

Die schlanke Silhouette und die hochwertigen Materialien verleihen ihm einen edlen Look. Das Display ist lebendig und gestochen scharf, was die Nutzung zu einem wahren Vergnügen macht. Die Farben sind kräftig und die Helligkeit passt sich automatisch an verschiedene Lichtverhältnisse an.Die Leistung dieses Smartphones hat mich wirklich umgehauen. Dank des leistungsstarken Prozessors läuft alles butterweich und reaktionsschnell. Das Multitasking funktioniert einwandfrei, selbst bei anspruchsvollen Anwendungen und Spielen. Die Kamera des V30T ist eine weitere Stärke. Die Fotos sind gestochen scharf und die Farbwiedergabe ist sehr naturgetreu. Besonders beeindruckt hat mich die Low-Light-Performance – selbst bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen gelingen beeindruckende Aufnahmen.Die Akkulaufzeit ist ebenfalls lobenswert. Ich kann das Smartphone den ganzen Tag intensiv nutzen, ohne mir Sorgen um leeren Akku machen zu müssen. Die Schnellladefunktion ist ein weiteres Highlight und sorgt dafür, dass ich das Gerät schnell wieder einsatzbereit habe.Die Benutzeroberfläche ist intuitiv und leicht zu navigieren. Ich schätze die vielfältigen Anpassungsmöglichkeiten, mit denen ich das Smartphone genau nach meinen Vorlieben gestalten kann.

I was sick and tired of all the little games Apple plays to get you to upgrade early. For context, I use my phone relatively lightly, pretty much only for calling, texting, browsing the internet, watching youtube videos, listening to music, and buying bus/train tickets, so I was comfortable browsing the ""budget phone"" market.After receiving this phone and putting in my old SIM card, I booted it to life and learned that it was very easy to transfer my photos, contacts, and other important information from my Apple phone to this A25, which I was very happy with. And I have a headphone jack back!!! I am so happy about having one again!!! Installing apps was relatively simple, and learning the functionalities of the phone was a bit of a learning curve coming from an Apple device. However, I have to say that after 2 weeks, I am genuinely quite impressed with the battery longevity, build quality, and speed of this phone. It does everything I need it to do and with relative smoothness and good speed. The battery on this A25, with my regular usage, lasts at least 24 hours, which is a huge upgrade from my old phone where I would constantly have to worry about plugging it in or bringing a portable battery.If you\'re a person who uses their phone heavily for high-processing tasks such as gaming or video editing, then this A25 probably isn\'t for you. But for me, this phone is great so far, and if it keeps performing like this in the long-term then I definitely will not be going back to Apple. And for $209, I am really impressed!\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jose A Torres', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great Storage 256gb Internal/ 1 Tbt Ext', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Excellent Galaxy A25G Phone with 8gn / 256 internal.Fast Start, Great Display.

I will go over all the cons first, then the pros. I don't like some of the apps they installed (also known as bloatware) and forced ads I have to watch to use them, & almost all of them I can't delete, only force stop them. There isn't a huge amount of them, but some.  I would not mind the bloatware in the phone as long as I can get rid of what I don't want, which isn't the case as they locked them. This is nonsense & although many companies do this practice it's always a negative. Instead of having the fingerprint on the touch screen it's on the power button on this phone. Due to it's very narrow width it's flaky at best to get it to read your fingerprint where it's mostly useless as it is much quicker just to enter your passcode. Also if you press to hard since it's also the power button trying to read your print it will put the screen out on you. This overall is a bad idea. Although the auto adaptive brightness is on by default I noticed it is brighter than desired so I have to manually adjust it frequently, but this is a matter of preference for me. The google widget is locked to it's position on home screen & totally unmovable or removable which is extremely irritating to me as I don't want it. It is frustrating that they lock stuff in this manner. Please let me be very clear I am not throwing this phone under the bus here, but rather pointing out some extremely important things that Umidigi needs to be aware of. The improvements made from the knowledge of these things we consumers aren't happy with is important for them. Now, lets get to the pros of this phone. Storage is awesome with 128G internal and expandable micro SD slot for even more, and the 6 gig of ram is very nice. Price for this phone for it's features is great! 50 megapixel camera does a very nice job, even has a macro that works well, and in the included photo you can see very good depth of field focus from foreground all the way to the back ground. Although I haven't done a lot of photo play with this yet I can assure all of you it's very good for it's price point. I done a couple of tests of game play (see photos) & although not a light speed device it does well. Normal use of apps, scrolling & pulling up web pages is very fast so it's great for me. Comes complete with screen protector & case already to go, but I will say the case is minimal for any protection for the phone as it is pretty thin & more plastic like & very little grip to your hand if your hands are dry, but fits perfectly so to be included is very cool! All settings work pretty well & although Android 14 like my other phone it is different in the user interface in some things that can get one a little out of whack to find some things shall we say. Power/volume up/down are on the right and work great with the case, & it also has a hotkey button on the left you can assign something specific to which is very nice. Love the 3.5mm jack plus the fact it's on the top of the phone. Just a personal preference but it's always in my way if it were to be on bottom of the phone in my opinion. Many phones now don't have that capability so it's a plus in my mind. Sound is very adequate also for it's speaker & ok for me. I plugged it in to power before I even turned it on for the first time and it had 100% battery in the phone. I installed my sim card and micro SD card before first power on & it took off perfectly & google easily took care of loading all of my apps from other phone doing the type C to type C phone to phone connection. Included also is a 15W charger W/type C to type C cable so you will have cable out of the box needed for transferring files to it from old phone. Very thoughtful of them to do this. Being totally unlocked for any carrier is a huge plus for sure, but just a word of note my Boost sim W/AT&T service cranked up and worked like a champ. Screen resolution quality & size is awesome! There are also some themes installed that are very nice too, & there are 6 of them. If you are in the market for a very good 5G phone with a lot of goodies/features for it's price then grab you one of these phones. I do highly recommend it!\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'mrkeetz', 'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Doesn't Work On Verizon or AT&T"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Really great phone for the price.

Large Screen, lots of storage, and Android 14.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I just love UMIDIGI cell phones. They are very reasonably priced and have lots of power and storage, so they are often a better value than some of the more expensive cell phone brands. One of the issues with the value phones is that they are later introducing some of the features and operating systems that the other brands provide. So, when I saw this 5G, Android 14 UMIDIGI G9 5G Cell Phone on Amazon.com, I snapped it up and had it delivered to Canada. Even with the cost of duty, the price was still very reasonable. I understand it is being released soon on Amazon.ca, but I just couldn't take the chance.This is the very first time, I’m aware of, that UMIDIGI released a 5G phone in North America, which is why I was so eager to pick one up.  Although the 5G platform is not widely available in my area, the great part about this phone is that when it does not find a 5G network, it automatically switches to 4G LTE and seamlessly continues to provide you with the best connection available. If you live in a large city, you’ll likely spend most of your day connected 5G and it is lightning fast comparatively.I really love the 6.75-inch, 90 MHz Eye-care Display. It’s very comfortable to look at everyday and it’s even enjoyable to watch a YouTube video or a Netflix movie on it. I think it’s the perfect size as anything bigger would probably start to feel like you’re carrying a small tablet in your pocket. Despite its large screen, this is amazingly comfortable to carry in your front or back pocket, and you hardly know it’s there.I’ve been using this UMIDIGI G9 5G Cell Phone for about a month now and it is the perfect daily driver. The processor is a solid Unisoc T765 Octa (eight) Core Processor that has 2 large 2.3 GHz Cortex-A73 cores and 6 smaller 2.1 GHz A55 cores on-board. It's a mid-level processor which provides very smooth computing whether your playing, communicating, creating or multitasking, and provides all the power the average user needs.The UMIDIGI G9 has 6GB of installed RAM. This is sufficient for most average users, in fact it's probably lots. If you noticed it comes with 12GB in the description, this is because Android 14 has a Memory Expansion option. It uses an equal amount of your storage space (ROM) as RAM. Now if you know don't know anything about RAM vs ROM (storage) speeds, RAM is almost instantaneous where storage is slower in comparison. However, if a memory-intensive app pushes your 6GB of ram, the expanded ram will jump in and allow your app to continue. I have not yet had a ram issue or a frozen app, whether using the unexpanded 6GB or the expanded 12GB.The G9 comes with 128 GB ROM storage. I consider myself to be an average to intermediate user and I'm currently using about 45 GB or about 1/3 of my storage. This includes 15GB in apps, 8GB of video and audio, 2GB of pictures, and don't forget, the first 13GB is required for your Android 14 operating system.The UMIDIGI G9 comes with dual sim card slots. One slot is a dedicated sim card slot and the other will accept either a second sim or a micro-SD card (up to 1TB). If you don't need more storage, the second sim slot can allow you to carry two phone numbers, like a work number and a personal number, on the same device. This is much better than having to carry two devices.The 5000mAh battery is lasting me about two days on a charge at a low, but comfortable, brightness level. However, I usually charge my phone every night, so I evaluated it during an 18-hour period. On FULL brightness, the G9 had 29% battery; at half, the device had 38% left; and at minimum brightness, the phone held 50% battery life after the full day.The only issue I have with this phone is that it does not come with NFC. This is the feature that allows you to tap your phone to pay with your Debit or Credit card. This is not something I use, but I know many users do. I think in these technological times, TAP should always be standard.If you want a worry-free, large-screen, smooth and reliable cell phone that won't let you down or break the bank, consider the UMIDIGI G9 5G. I chose the GREEN and I really LOVE the colour. It even comes with an installed screen protector and a FREE basic case.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Amazon Customer', 'Rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""Will not work on AT&T-- not really 'unlocked for all carriers'."", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024', 'Review Body': 'phone seems solid and fast\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Beltrán', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Spain on October 12, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Umidigi pertenece a un grupo de fabricantes de teléfonos de buen aspecto y funcionalidad manteniendo los precios competitivos.

Der UNISOC T765 liefert 395.000 Antutu Punkte, damit ist es grob auf dem Level eines Snapdragon 865, also des Top-Prozessors vor 3 Jahren.Das Gerät hat 6GB RAM...nicht auf die die Werbesprüche hören (gehören verboten) mit den 6+6 = 12gb. Arbeitsspeicher und normaler Handyspeicher sind nicht vergleichbar (Geschwindigketi usw.). Daher die Option am besten gar nicht einschalten. . Apps und das System laufen trotzdem sehr reibungslos und es gab bisher keinerlei Ruckler.Der 5000mAh Akku ist ein weiteres Highlight. Die lange Akkulaufzeit hält den ganzen Tag und mit der 18W Schnellladefunktion ist das Handy schnell wieder einsatzbereit.Ein paar Abstriche gibt es jedoch bei der Kamera und den Lautsprechern. Die 50MP Hauptkamera liefert nur Standardbilder, die zwar für den Alltag ausreichen, aber nicht mit der Qualität teurerer Smartphones mithalten können. Die (Mono-) Lautsprecher klingen auch etwas blechern, was das Medienerlebnis etwas trübt und schade das kein NFC (fürs mobile bezahlen) eingebaut wurde.

Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kahloni', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Great phone', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024', 'Review Body': 'I ordered this phone back in April/may and I do not regret it one bit!

I'm thrilled with the speed of the performance of this phone. When you click an app or a link, etc., the phone immediately does what you want it to do without lagging, pausing, or delay. 🙂2. I'm thrilled with the speed of recharging this phone. And I've never timed it before or read how fast it charges, however, you can see how fast the battery percentage increases, and before you know it, your phone is fully charged. 😁3. I purchased this phone renewed, therefore, I bought it at a discount price. However, the performance of this phone is like new and I'm very thrilled about that. 😁4. I love the animated 3D lock screen image of the little moving objects, which I have screen shots of in the images for this review. Also, I don't think I've ever seen a phone lock screen with animated 3D images before. 🙂CONS1. I'm not a big fan of the fingerprint sensor being on the front screen of the phone because it makes it difficult to open your phone when you're driving. However, I do like the lime green color that lights up when you press on it.2. Also, I will admit that I am disappointed that the Contacts screen doesn't have the alphabetical listing of each letter of the alphabet on the right-hand column so that you can press the letter that you want so that the screen will take you to your contacts that begin with that letter. But instead, it just has a column of little black dots going down the right side of the page. 😕3. Now, I asked about this one in the Customer Questions before purchasing it, but I thought the phone speaker was near your ear. However, the phone speaker is at the bottom of the page. Although, I'm not really sure where the microphone is, but most people I talk to seem to be able to hear me and I'm able to hear the sounds coming out of the phone pretty good.But all in all, I'm more thrilled about the Pros of this phone than I am about the disappointments of the Cons of this phone, which really aren't that great.

You can also go the used phone route and pick like an iPhone or Samsung that\'s about three to five years old for this price range (under $200). But if you want something brand new and shiny, then there is pretty much one option, and that\'s generic phones from China. I have already reviewed a couple Doogee phones, and find them very decent phones for their price range, and this one is no different. What is different though, is that this phone right now as of me writing this review, has a $60 off coupon which turns the phone to only $130 plus tax. And for all the features and ""phone"" that you get from this, this is such an excellent value.First, I really like that they did not skimp on the specs, so you get 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of memory. Don\'t be fooled by the 20GB faux advertising - the extra 12GB is just virtual memory and doesn\'t behave like a phone with actual 20GB of RAM would. To sum it up simply, it allows you to have more apps open without them having to refresh/restart when you switch back to them, but doesn\'t make the phone any faster.The camera is decent if you shoot during the day or in situations with really good lighting. At night, it gets very soft and ""smushy"", or pixelated like a bad quality video stream. Good for posting on Facebook where they will smush the heck out of your photos anyways.I would extra recommend this phone if you have a business or situation where you wouldn\'t need this phone is your primary phone. It can be your business phone where the main goal is communication, and not like all the extra fun stuff you\'d do on your expensive phone. Or perhaps you need a burner phone for your nefarious ways and lifestyle. Then if something were to happen, being out $130 isn\'t so bad. It\'s especially great if you need to travel overseas and want that second phone as a peace of mind.\nRead more'}]",15.07537688442211,B0D41NPTN6,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D41NPTN6,4g

But I should have known from having challenges in the past with JLab gear and Android phones (I can't speak for iPhones).  When put into pairing mode, my phone sees it and asks to pair.  It succeeded and let me use it for calls about 1 in 20 attempts.  The other 19 resulted in it pairing, and then immediately disconnecting or rebooting the phone.  I have an older Samsung S10 Galaxy phone, but it works fine with all other BT devices (my car, workout headset, Galaxy Watch, etc.).  But this device cannot connect or maintain a solid BT connection no matter what I did.So I returned it, and bought a Poly Voyager 4320 for about the same price.  Received it, plugged it in, put it into pairing mode, and immediately paired and maintained the connection just fine.Ultimately if you want to have a reliable (it just works, you don't have to think about it) solution, this - at least from my experience - is not for you.

For a regular user, it\'s a great phone for the price.\nRead more'}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Kindle Customer', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': ""The worst Motorola phone that I've ever owned"", 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024', 'Review Body': ""On quite a few Motorola phones over the last 6 years but this one is an absolute piece of junk. And the reason it's a piece of junk is because Motorola has messed with the basic Android that Google supplies and calls it Motorola Android and Motorola has no competent programmers to be messing on anything that Google puts out for programming on phones. These people were not even smart enough to put in a selection to look at all the apps that are installed. They only put in a selection to look at the most recent apps in the default apps. The standard Google Android has both. I'm trying to save you from wasting five or six hours of your life trying to set up with this thing so that it'll actually work and has the stuff that was on your old phone to use. I'm going to add to this that the notifications have stopped working properly. You spend more time trying to administer this phone instead of being able to actually use it to get any work done. And I would never ever consider doing any online banking with a piece of crap phone like thisUpdate when I got this phone somebody had set the gestures attached to the power button to turn on Google Assistant instead of restarting the phone. It's taken me numerous hours to finally figure out how to fix this issue. In my opinion this was not a new phone but it was advertised as new.Update 9/4/24 This phone is like all the other g series I have owned since 2022 which is 3 of them.  All of them have this uncontrolled scolling problem where the screen will all of a sudden scroll at speed up or down. This has been a problem with the last 4 Motorola phones I have had.  I have turned it in to Motorola twice now and they have done nothing to fix the issue which is about par for Motorola customer service.  BE AWARE IF YOU PURCHASE A MOTOROLA PHONE THAT YOU WILL NOT GET QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'DJ GodsOwn', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'This phone is amazing for the price!!!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024', 'Review Body': ""I love this phone! What else can I say. It has a nice big screen, plenty of storage space which you can expand with a micro SD card. I can move between apps very quickly as the phone has plenty of power to run what I need to. I love the fingerprint reader which allows me to log into some of my apps by just holding my thumb onto the right side power button. It also has face recognition. I have only ever had Samsung Android phones in the past and this is my first Motorola phone. I like the way it works better than the Samsung. Everything is just intuitive and very easy to get along with. For text message codes, it lets you copy the code in the notification or it will auto-capture the code so you can just paste it into the app you need to. With my Samsung phones, that feature was always hit or miss. The camera is great and captures great images and video. Even the front facing camera is great quality and you can get nice selfies on it. Definitely make sure you grab a case for it and I would also recommend a glass screen protector. I can't believe how inexpensive this phone was for how great it is. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone. Oh and did I mention it's 5G capable?! Amazing!\nRead more""}]",44.17670682730924,,,5g
