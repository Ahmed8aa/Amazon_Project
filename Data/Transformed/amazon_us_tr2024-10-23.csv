I was sick of it. I really liked the refined design of the fold 6 and knew I wanted something that felt vastly different from a candy bar form factor.The phone was great and had a lot of features that wowed me. The AI tools were fun and silly and the screens were bright and vibrant. I got blue bubbles working at home and thought I was good to go.A week passed and I realized I wasn't in love. That damn front screen is just so narrow. I have little hands. I'm a small guy. I didn't think it would bother me. I couldn't type a sentence on it to save my life. The cases for it added such a strange cheap bulky feeling to the phone and made me feel like I was carrying around a TV remote. The inner screen was so damn glossy, I couldn't see outside or even in my apartment for that matter because it reflected EVERYTHING around me and was covered in smudges in an instant. You can't set the phone down flat on a table because of the camera placement. It was also uncomfortable to hold with those sharp corners.The one plus open has fixed all of those issues for me. The inner screen feels so much more premium and the outer screen is a perfect size. I love the anti glare inside and can't get over how shallow the crease is. I honestly even like the OS more. Coming from iOS, it's a little more inviting. Of course I miss the wireless charging and AI features, but I can absolutely live without those. The cameras are so much better and I prefer the more tasteful image processing. Samsung pics look like an acid trip, they're so oversaturated. The OnePlus open feels so much more premium and carefully crafted. I also don't really need these phones to be much thinner...I like how solid the open feels. I don't feel like it's going to break every time I unfold it. While it may not be snapdragon 8 gen 3, gen 2 runs extremely well. Battery life is absolutely better even at high performance.So happy to join the OnePlus ecosystem. Such a brilliantly balanced device.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'TMac', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'AWESOME Foldable phone!', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024', 'Review Body': ""What can I say? The last foldable phone I had was the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2. I liked it a lot but eventually grew tired of the heaviness and ended up selling it. I also found the tall, slim, remote control profile of the outer screen to be uncomfortable to use at times, not to mention its unwieldy reachability. Unfortunately, Samsung has chosen to stick with the tall, skinny, barely useable design of the outer screen. OnePlus, on the other hand, provides a normal size outer screen, much better hinge with almost no detectable crease when open, a larger screen and many say an even better camera (albeit a much more obtrusive one) than even the new Samsung Fold 6! And even though it does not have the IP48 submersible rating Samsung has or the wireless charging, it does come with a proprietory 67 watt fast charger in the box that allows it to charge the phone from zero to 100% in under 45 minutes. Neither Samsung nor the new Pixel Pro 9 foldable can achieve anywhere near that level of fast charging. And the OPO beats both of those products in battery life by a mile! It's a matter of personal preference of course but, for me, the OPO is the far superior choice . You may feel otherwise. Oh yeah, forgot to mention it's just as light to hold and carry around as the new Samsung Fold 6 despite having a wider outer screen and a bigger inner screen. And with 512 GB it is hundreds of dollars cheaper than a comparable new Samsung or Pixel foldable, especially with the trade-in deal OnePlus is offering. You should also know unfortunately, OnePlus is only offering three years of software updates for this phone and four years security updates, while Samsung is promising 7 years. But honestly, there's no way I'm going to hang on to this phone for three more years. I'll likely trade it in when the OnePlus Open 2 makes its debut next year or the year after.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Tobey64', 'Rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Solid phone and price is great for what you get.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024', 'Review Body': ""Oneplus open has stunning screens both outer and inner.

The innovative foldable design is not just a gimmick; it adds real value and functionality to the device.Design and Build Quality: The craftsmanship of the OnePlus Open is superb. The hinge mechanism feels sturdy and reliable, and the overall build exudes premium quality. The foldable display is smooth and seamless, providing an expansive viewing area without any noticeable creases or interruptions.Display: The dual displays are both vibrant and sharp, with excellent color accuracy and brightness levels.

The flexibility of the foldable design even allows for unique photography angles and perspectives.Value: For a foldable phone, the OnePlus Open is reasonably priced, offering cutting-edge technology and top-tier performance without the exorbitant cost typically associated with foldable devices.In summary, the OnePlus Open foldable mobile combines innovative design with exceptional performance and great value.

It looked like a new phone, couldn\'t find a single sign it had been used. The plastic film was still on the back and sides. For the price it was a great buy. I cant see spending more than a few hundred dollars on one and this was in the $250 area total. There are a couple things I don\'t care for but have nothing to do with it being ""renewed"". The battery life leaves a bit to be desired. My last couple phones all had batteries in the 5000mA range so this having only a 3300mA battery is very noticeable, no more lasting all day and charging at night while sleeping like I\'ve been doing for years with my Moto G Stylus 5G phones(2021&2023 models).I\'m used to using the tempered glass screen protectors which can\'t be used on this one. I\'ve tried a couple of the flexible film ones with it but wasted the money because couldn\'t get them to install properly(without air bubbles everywhere). The phone screen is soft. It will get dents/creases in it if not careful(I put a light crease in mine trying to install a screen protector).  When opened its not perfectly flat, there\'s a shallow area where the fold is but it\'s not  visually noticeable with the screen on at all. Only noticeable by touch and visually when the screen is off. The non expandable memory isn\'t a feature I like. 128GB isn\'t a whole lot nowadays, especially when it\'s common for apps to be 1GB-3GB(like games and Facebook). I used to keep my games, photos, and entertainment/social media apps on a SD card but now I\'m just being a lot more selective with what I install and quick to uninstall something if it\'s not being used regularly, whereas with expandable memory I\'d just leave them on the SD card. I read that it will no longer receive updates from Samsung so Android 14 is going to be the last operating system upgrade for it.Size is the reason I bought it. Got tired of carrying phones that only fit in back pockets and still have 1/4 of it sticking out. With this I get the same size screen but can put it in any pocket. It\'s unlocked compatible with GSM and CDMA service providers so works with all the major ones.All in all it\'s a good phone loaded with features, looks and functions like a new one for 1/2 the price,and it\'s second life is helping the planet with saving resources and landfill space.

So Far', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2022', 'Review Body': 'A bit of background about my experiences with ""renewed"" smartphones: I had originally purchased a renewed Samsung Flip 5G (the one with the smaller outside display) from eBay for about $250. The phone lasted about three days before the inner screen blacked out. I then purchased a renewed Google Pixel 6 through Amazon\'s Renewed Guarantee program. That one arrived with defective cameras. So I was leery about taking a chance again on this Flip 3, considering this device\'s history of stability to begin with. But I didn\'t want to pay full price for brand new, so I decided to roll the dice. At least I\'d have the 100 day guarantee to give it a proper shakedown.So far, I\'m very pleased. The phone is indistinguishable from brand new, and there are no problems with the screen so far. Not a heavy user, but I give the hinge a good workout through a regular day. The battery life is notoriously bad to begin with, but I don\'t detect it\'s any worse for being in a renewed product, and used frugally, I can typically get a full day out of it.My biggest complaint is that I would prefer to use the Google apps over the Samsung apps for phone, texting, etc. The Google software is more sophisticated, but doesn\'t seem to work with the exterior screen. So I\'m stuck with Samsung -- an inconvenience, but not a deal breaker.But otherwise, I love this phone. I love its feel, its weight, the way it fits in my hand -- both closed and opened -- and in my pocket. The tech may not be any more sophisticated than Samsung\'s ""flat"" offerings, but since the renewed price is about the same as their more modest phones, I\'m not regretting the purchase.

Only one place has tiny small cometic scratch is on the middle of backcase where the phone is folding, but it is hardly noticeable. Switching from iPhone to Android is painful because Apple didn't make it easy to transfer contacts to android. But it worths the trouble to make this change for me. Over all, I will recommend this seller and the Flip 3.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Mitch', 'Rating': 'N/A', 'Title': 'N/A', 'Date': 'Reviewed in Canada on October 15, 2024', 'Review Body': 'Phone glitches out and screen goes blank.

He was also drawn to the hue that we selected, which was a light blue. This item is obviously intended for children because of its adorable and non-threatening style. Establishing the phone was a relatively simple process. I just completed the process of inserting the SIM card, and it immediately connected to our wifi network. My youngster has no trouble navigating the UI since it is straightforward and basic. He likes the fact that he can access applications that are suitable for children, play games, and even snap some images using the camera that is integrated into the device. Moreover, this small phone has shown that it is incredibly long-lasting. The fact that it has been dropped a few times, which is to be expected for a child eight years old, has not caused any harm to it. It seems that the plastic case is quite resistant to impact. In spite of being thrown into pockets and bags on a regular basis, it still has the appearance of being brand new.\nRead more""}, {'Reviewer Name': 'Jennifer Hoots', 'Rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Title': 'Never worked.', 'Date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024', 'Review Body': ""It never.Worked. unfortunately I didn't open the box until a few days after the return window.

However, even after several hours of charging, it only showed a 1% charge and remained stuck on the same home screen.Despite my efforts to get it to work, it never moved past this initial state. What was supposed to be a handy and portable device turned into a huge source of frustration. Additionally, customer service was not helpful in resolving this issue, which added to my disappointment.I eventually decided to return this product and request a refund. For a phone that was supposed to be useful and functional, it failed completely right from the start.I strongly advise against purchasing this product, as it seems many other customers have experienced similar issues, ranging from battery failures to complete malfunctions.
